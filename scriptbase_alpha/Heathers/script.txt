FADE IN:

EXT. SAWYER'S BACKYARD--DAWN

Elegiac music murmurs as three female and barefoot PAIRS OF
LEGS in skirts break from tableau to gently engage in Croquet.
A blue mallet hits a blue ball through a wicket, a green
mallet knocks a green ball, and a yellow mallet pushes forward
a yellow ball, all in enticing syncopation.

Suddenly a red ball rockets through the dew covered grass and
hits the green ball. The LEGS all stop moving as a FOURTH PAIR
OF LEGS, this one in stylish shoes and stockings, marches to
the red ball and steps on it. A red mallet is brought down
hard on the red ball causing the adjacent green ball to
thunder out of view. The Pair of Legs manuevering the green
ball departs. This process of elimination is grimly
repeated with the yellow ball and yet again with the blue
ball.

However, when the BLUE MALLETED PLAYER makes her sad exit,
the viewer's viewpoint glides along with this particular Pair
of Legs. A red ball whizzes by. The Legs stop. Another red
ball malevolently sails past the Legs. Then yet another red
ball. A fourth red ball makes brutal contact with the Legs
causing the Player to fall to her knees and into the frame. The
Player is VERONICA SAWYER.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY

VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty, lies atop
her bed dressed in a chic but understated ensemble, her eyes
glazed open in a morning reverie. She blows up at her bangs
then slides off her bed, launching into voice-over narration
over the empty bed.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Heather told me she teaches people
     Real Life.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY

Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling
high school hallway with a frozen smile.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.
     If you want to fuck with the eagles,
     you have to learn to fly.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CAFETERIA--DAY

With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the
outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint
approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     I said so you teach people how to
     spread their wings and fly. She
     said Yes.

THE DIARY PAGE

VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words
echoed by her voice-over.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     I said You're Beautiful.

A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
to recklessly rocket across the written words.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
     God, come on Veronica!

VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,
trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.

          VERONICA
     What's your damage, Heather? You
     ruined my...

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,
     blame Heather. She told me to haul
     your ass into the caf pronto. Back
     me up, Heather.

From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.
She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."

          HEATHER DUKE
     Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

          VERONICA
     Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

INT. INSIDE THE CAFETERIA--DAY

VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,
strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.

The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and
expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied
back.

          VERONICA
          (submissively)
     Hello, Heather.

Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER
CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is
consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of
     Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge
     a hot and horny but realistically
     low-key note in Kurt's handwriting
     and we'll slip it into Martha
     Dumptruck's lunch tray.

          VERONICA
     Shit, Heather. I don't have anything
     against Martha Dunnstock.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     You don't have anything for her
     either. Come on, it'll be Very. The
     note'll give her shower nozzle
     masturbation material for weeks.

          VERONICA
     I'll think about it.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
          (looking off)
     Don't think.

POV ON CAFETERIA LINE

Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in
line.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the
outstretched pen.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica
     needs something to write on.
     Heather, bend over.

Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER
CHANDLER violently laughs.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.

HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Heather Duke, back down.

VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Dear Martha, you're so sweet..

THE JOCKS' TABLE

The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY and the massive RAM sit
with other typical Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

          KURT
     It'd be so righteous to be in a
     Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
     sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
together.

          RAM
     Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on
     my Johnson and just start spinning
     her like a fucking pinwheel.

RAM makes a frantic spinning motion.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up along
with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.

HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.

VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then, grasping
her lunch tray with both hands, moves toward VERONICA and the
HEATHERS.

HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as
MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER
passes the note to her frantic disciple.

In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA
saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
note onto MARTHA's tray.

The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,
bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand which
has a cashbox reading THE FOODLESS FUND and a banner reading
WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.

          PETER
     Come on people, let's give that
     leftover lunch money to people
     without lunches! Those tater tots
     you threw away today are a delicacy
     in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!

HEATHERS' TABLE

The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER
DUKE sitting themselves down first.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
          (looking to the stand)
     God, aren't they fed yet? Do they
     even have Thanksgiving in Africa?

          VERONICA
          (low key sarcasm)
     Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater
     tots; it's a real party continent.

HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Sawyer. Guess what today is?

          VERONICA
     Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So
     what's the question?

          HEATHER DUKE
     Yeah, so what's the question?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     God-damn Heather, you were with me
     in Study Hall when I thought of it.
     Such a pillowcase.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (hurt)
     I forgot.

ANOTHER ANGLE

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.

          VERONICA
     Hey, this question wouldn't be that
     bizarro thing you were babbling
     about over the phone last......

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he
     gave me another topic that was
     political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly
captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause
lunchbox. They make eye contact.

Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a
slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by
clones.

          BETTY
     Sorry Veronica.

          VERONICA
     Betty Finn. Gosh.....

VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.

          VERONICA
     I'm really sorry I couldn't make it
     to your birthday party last month.

          BETTY
     That's okay. Your Mom said you had
     a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip
     my own birthday party for a date.

VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.

          VERONICA
         Don't say that.

          BETTY
         Oh Ronnie, you have to look at
         what I dug up the other day.

BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween
costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the
floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

          VERONICA
     I was talking with someone!

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Color me impressed. I thought you
     grew out of Betty Finn.

THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the
approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club
kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out.

          COURTNEY
     Oh great. Here comes Heather.

          KEITH
     Shit.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA
finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and
brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it.

THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids
with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling
smile.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,
     let me snare a tater.

COURTNEY expresses elation in spite of herself as HEATHER
CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot
and turning back around.

          COURTNEY
     Thanks. I just got it last night at
     the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her
eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     That's pretty very. Now check this out. You
     win five million dollars from Publishers
     Sweepstakes, but on the same day what's-
     his-face gives you the check, aliens
     land on earth and say they're going
     to blow up the world in two days.
     What would you do?

A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.

          KEITH
     That's easy. I'd just slide that wad
     over to my father. He's like one of
     the top brokers in the state.

          VERONICA
     Wake up. In two days, Earth's going
     up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.

          KEITH
     Man, in two days, my dad could
     double my money. Triple it.

          COURTNEY
     If I got that money, I'd give it
     all to the Homeless. Every cent.

          VERONICA
     You're beautiful.

THE FOODLESS FUND STAND

PETER reaches into the Foodless Fund Box and takes some bills.

          PETER
     Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey
     D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.

          DENNIS
     But that's the Foodless Fund money.

          PETER
     Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat.
     If it makes you feel better, bag the
     fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.

CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     If you're going to openly be a bitch....

          VERONICA
          (submissive)
     I'm sorry, it's just why can't we
     talk to different kinds of people?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I
     look like Mother Theresa? If I did,
     I probably wouldn't mind talking to
     the Geek Squad.

She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed
students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear
both.

THE GEEKS' TABLE

The GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY
splatters milk over himself.

          RODNEY
     Did you see that? Heather Number
     One looked right at us.

          BIG CYNIC
     It must be love.

CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER.

          VERONICA
     Doesn't it bother you that everyone in
     the school thinks you're a piranha?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Like I give a shit. They all want me,
     as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped
     at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

          VERONICA
     Pretend you're a missionary saving
     a colony of cootie victims.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
          (giving in)
     Whatever. I don't believe this. We're
     going to a party at Remington University
     tonight and we're brushing up our
     conversation skills with the
     scum of the school.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

Her sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the
note.

THE GEEKS' TABLE

The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an
involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful
interviewers.

          GEEK WITH BRACES
     No seriously, I'd probably go to
     Egypt. With a girl.

          BIG CYNIC
     Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on
     the last day of Mankind. You
     sentimental old fart.

          BRACES
     Geez, forget it.

          VERONICA
     What about you Rodney?

          RODNEY
          (quietly to the others)
     I told you she knew my name.
          (beat of contemplation)
     I'd change my life. New clothes.
     New haircut. New house. New home.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     How sad! Blowing all your cash on
     two days of trying to be hip.

ANOTHER ANGLE

VERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table.

          VERONICA
     If you're going to openly be a bitch....

As HEATHER CHANDLER continues to guffaw, VERONICA again
catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY. He wraps his fingers
around an egg and unfolds them back. The egg is gone. He
smiles. VERONICA smiles back.

Her trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and
HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.

POV ON MARTHA

MARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT
KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     This is the part I hate. The waiting.
     I'd say we're like twenty minutes from
     major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.

HEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a
moment to react.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Veronica?

VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out.

          VERONICA
     Damn..

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAY

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking
lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a
car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers
     are the same. Didn't you see The
     Breakfast Club?

INT. CAFETERIA--BETTY FINN'S TABLE--DAY

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY
FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS.

          HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
     Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl
     in the commercials and the videos.

JOCKS' TABLE

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts of
the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.

          HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
     I'm the blonde in the bikini on the
     horse holding a Pepsi can.

INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

In a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER cough
toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress.

          HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
     I'm the princess being spanked on the
     throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar.

INT. THE FOODLESS FUND STAND--DAY

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER accost PETER DAWSON at the
Foodless Fund stand.

          HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
     What do I get out of being friends
     with losers. I give them a piece of
     a winner and they stain me with loserness.

EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

Heavy Metaler MATT grins.

          MATT
     You get five million dollars but
     some Martians are going to zap you
     in two days. You hear that, Clyde?
     That's got to be the most spooky-ass
     question I've ever heard.

INT. CAFETERIA--BETTY FINN'S TABLE--DAY

BETTY FINN daintily peeps up.

          BETTY FINN
     I think we should use the money
     for an End-of-the-world get-together.
     We could invite guys.

JOCKS' TABLE

RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow.

          RAM
     I'd pay Madonna one million dollars
     to ride my face like the Kentucky
     Derby. She should be paying me, though.

INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops...

          FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
     What?

INT. CAFETERIA--THE FOODLESS FUND STAND--DAY

PETER DAWSON lashes out.

          PETER DAWSON
     This is important. With taxes, I'd
     be only getting 3.5 million and....

EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT.

          CLYDE
     If you want a good way to go out
     before the aliens land, get a lion
     from the zoo. Put a remote control
     bomb up its butt. When the lion starts
     tearing you up, press the bomb button.
     You and the lion die like as one.

Two Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against
the windshield blankly respond.

          JACKIE AND STEVE
     Cool.

INT. CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE--DAY

VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation
chugging through another busy cafeteria lane.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Just imagine somebody like your
     quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty
     Finn doing a Crest commercial. No
     one would buy Crest.

          VERONICA
     Don't tell me. Crest would be
     stained with loserness.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?

HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Oh God, here we go...

POV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK

MARTHA, with awkward apprehension, stumbles toward KURT and
the JOCKS. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stop breathing.

MARTHA mumbles something unintelligible from where the girls
stand. KURT'S head detonates with a terrifying cackle. MARTHA
flees the cafeteria in horror. VERONICA spins away from her
mirthful friends in disgust and makes eye contact with the
similarly disturbed JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.

VERONICA lurches away. She brakes against the Foodless Fund
stand where PETER DAWSON is hollering away.

          PETER
     A dime increases the time! A buck
     brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A
     five keeps the neighborhood alive!
     A ten and you die without sen!

HEATHER CHANDLER wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
          (to Veronica)
     You wanted to become a member of
     the most powerful clique in the
     school. If I wasn't already the
     head of it, I'd want the same thing.

          VERONICA
     I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     That episode with the note back there
     was for all of us to enjoy, but you
     seem determined to ruin my day.

          VERONICA
          (slapping her knee)
     We made a girl want to consider
     suicide. What a scream. What a jest.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Come on you jerk. You know you used
     to have a sense of humor.

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

Combing their hair in the bathroom mirror, the HEATHERS speak
in comically whining-and-pathetic imitations of Martha
Dumptruck as VERONICA shakes her head with a half-smile.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

HEATHER DUKE's gentle off-screen voice slices in.

          HEATHER DUKE (O.S.)
     Veronica, could you come back here?

     HEATHER CHANDLER AND HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Gross!

          VERONICA
     A true friend's work is never done.

VERONICA reveals her right index finger is cut noticeably
short, then walks over to the stalls.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Color me nauseous.

THE STALL

VERONICA stands in a tight stall with an ashamed HEATHER DUKE.

          VERONICA
     Maybe you should see a doctor.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Yeah, maybe.

          HEATHER CHANDLER (O.S.)
     Come on Heather. We want another
     look at today's lunch.

          VERONICA
     Geez, don't listen to them.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
     Did she have the pie or the ice
     cream for dessert?
          (like a game show host)
     And the answer is.

HEATHER DUKE holds up her copy of The Catcher in the Rye and
makes a bizarrely defiant smile.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in
     the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put
     up with their bogus nonsense.

          VERONICA
     Well, you better move Holden out
     of the way or he's going to get spewed.

HEATHER DUKE puts down her book and opens her mouth. VERONICA
sticks her finger in.

CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

A gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a
plate into a cafeteria trashcan as VERONICA and the HEATHERS
stroll by outside. VERONICA pauses to peer in at the JAMES
DEANESQUE GUY.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     God Veronica, drool much? His name's
     Jason Dean. He's in my American History.

          VERONICA
     Give me the clipboard.

As VERONICA walks off, HEATHER MCNAMARA oinks out some amusing
sexual noises.

CAFETERIA/JASON DEAN'S TABLE

VERONICA saunters to JASON DEAN.

          VERONICA
     Hello Jason Dean.

          JASON
     Greetings and salutations. Call me
     J.D. Are you a Heather?

          VERONICA
     No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may
     seem like a stupid question....

          J.D.
     There are no stupid questions.

          VERONICA
     If you inherit five million dollars
     the same day aliens tell the earth
     they're blowing us up in two days,
     what would you do?

          J.D.
          (suavely)
     That's the stupidest question I've
     ever heard.

JOCKS' TABLE

The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D.

          RAM
     Who does that new kid think he is
     with that coat? Bo Diddley?

          KURT
     Veronica is into his act. No doubt.

          RAM
     Let's kick his ass.

          KURT
     Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old
     for that crap. Let's give him a
     scare though.

J.D.'S TABLE

An intrigued J.D. laconically answers the question.

          J.D.
     Probably just row on out to the
     middle of a lake. Bring along my
     sax, some tequila, and some Bach.

          VERONICA
     How very.

HEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Come on.

          VERONICA (to J.D.)
     Later.

          J.D.
     Definitely.

KURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place.
RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate.

          RAM
     You going to eat this?

          KURT
     What did your boyfriend say when
     you told him you were moving to
     Sherwood, Ohio?

          RAM
     Answer him dick!

          KURT
     Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria
     have a No Fags Allowed Rule?

          J.D.
     It seems to have an open door policy
     for assholes though, doesn't it?

          KURT
     What did you say dickweed?

          J.D.
     I'll repeat myself.

J.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a
.357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer.

EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY

Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA
and the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard
holding different colored mallets next to matching balls.
HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     God, they won't expell him. They'll
     just suspend him for a week or something.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     He used a real gun. They should
     throw his ass in jail.

          VERONICA
     No way. He used blanks. All J.D.
     really did was ruin two pairs of
     pants...Maybe not even that...
          (giggling)
     Can you bleach out urine stains?

HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S green
one.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought
     you were giving up on high school guys.

          VERONICA
     Never say never.

          HEATHER DUKE
     What are you going to do, Heather?
     Take the two shots or send me out?

The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous
faces.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Did you have a brain tumor for
     breakfast? First you ask if you can
     be red, knowing that I'm always red...

HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings
her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent
green one rocketing into a flower bed.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Shit.

HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
          (to HEATHER DUKE)
     Damn. It's your turn Heather.

          HEATHER DUKE
     No, it's Heather's turn.

HEATHER MCNAMARA hits her ball through a wicket and squeals.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Anyway, I can say never to high
     school. I've got David.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     King David.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Maybe when you hit maturity you'll
     understand the diff between a Remington
     University man like David and a
     Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam-
     thank-you-maam" Sweeney.

HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.

HEATHER DUKE tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     No way, no day!

          VERONICA
     Give it up girl!

As her friends howl, HEATHER DUKE slams her ball out of the
flower bed. The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes
through a wicket. HEATHER DUKE squeals in delight.

         VERONICA              HEATHER MCNAMARA
    Holy shit!          God, that was unbelievable!

          HEATHER CHANDLER
         What. A. Shot.

HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
VERONICA begins setting up her shot.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     So tonight's the night. Are you
     two excited?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her
     first Remington Party. Blow it tonight
     girl and it's keggers with kids all
     next year.

          VERONICA
          (missing her shot)
     Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've
     been set up with? Witty and urbane
     pre-lawyer or albino accountant?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Don't worry. David says he's very
     so he's very.

HEATHER CHANDLER again hits her ball into HEATHER DUKE'S.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Why?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Why not?

HEATHER CHANDLER slams HEATHER DUKE's ball back into the
flower bed. VERONICA'S MOM calls out the back screen door.

          MOM
     Heather, your Mother's here.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Come on whoever wants a ride.

As the HEATHERS head into the house, VERONICA picks up HEATHER
DUKE'S ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets.

Veronica's MOM, carrying a tray of pate, and DAD, carrying a
Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table.

          DAD
     Take a break Veronica, sit down.

          VERONICA
     All right.

VERONICA sinks into the empty middle deck chair.

          DAD
     So what was the first week of
     Spring Vacation withdrawl like?

          VERONICA
     I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

          MOM
     Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?

          VERONICA
     I guess.

          MOM
     Any contestants worth mentioning?

          VERONICA
     Maybe. There's kind of a dark
     horse now in the running.

          DAD
          (looking up)
     Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
     me why I read this spy crap.

          VERONICA
          (smiling)
     Because you're an idiot.

          DAD
     Oh yeah, that's it.

DAD immediately returns to reading with a wide grin.

          MOM
          (shaking her head)
     You two....

          VERONICA
     Great pate, but I'm going to have
     to motor if I want to be ready for
     the party tonight.

EXT. OUTSIDE 7-11--NIGHT

A Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with
HEATHER CHANDLER at the wheel. VERONICA pops out of the
car, into the store. HEATHER CHANDLER clamors to her.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Corn nuts!

INT. 7-11--NIGHT

Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag
of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her.

          J.D. (O.S.)
     You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

          VERONICA
     No, but if you're nice I'll let
     you buy me a Slurpee. You know
     your 7-11speak pretty well.

          J.D.
     I've been moved around all my life;
     Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood
     Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any
     town, any time, I can pop a Ham and
     Cheese in the microwave and feast on
     a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.

          VERONICA
     Really? That thing in the caf
     today was pretty severe.

          J.D.
     The extreme always makes an impression,
     but you're right, it was severe. Did
     you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?

          VERONICA
     I didn't. Cherry.

VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile.

EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT--NIGHT

VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle.

          VERONICA
     Great bike.

HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace. VERONICA
glares at her then turns back to J.D.

          J.D.
     Just a humble perk from my Dad's
     Construction company or should I
     say Deconstruction company?

          VERONICA
     I don't know. Should you?

          J.D.
     My father seems to enjoy tearing
     things down more than putting things up.
     Seen the commerical? "Bringing every
     State to a Higher State."

          VERONICA
     Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's
     Big Bud Dean Construction. Must be
     rough. Moving place to place.

          J.D.
     Everybody's life's got static. Is
     your life perfect?

          VERONICA
          (gently joking)
     Sure, I'm on my way to a party
     at Remington University.

VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again.

          VERONICA
     It's not perfect. I don't really
     like my friends.

          J.D.
     I don't really like your friends either.

          VERONICA
     It's like they're just people I
     work with and our job is being
     popular and shit.

          J.D.
     Maybe it's time for a vacation.

The car horn blares again.

INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT

DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically
tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door.

The semi-handsome BRAD chats atop a desk with BRAD'S FRIEND.

          DAVID
     Throw your coats on the bed, girls.

          BRAD
     That exam was so bogus.

          BRAD'S FRIEND
     Oh I know. Which exam?

          DAVID
     Veronica, this is Brad.

          BRAD
     Excellent. Did you girls bring
     your partying slippers?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Yeah, let's party.

          DAVID
     She loves to party.

As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in BRAD'S
FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party
VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing
monocoled VERONICA writes at her desk.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Dear Diary, I want to kill and you
     have to believe.....damn pen!

VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to
write. She throws the pen across the room and pulls out
another.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     You have to believe it's for more
     than selfish reasons. More than a
     spoke in my menstrual cycle. You
     have to believe me.

INT. DORMITORY HALLWAY--NIGHT

The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music.
VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the
laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS.

BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches
DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door.

          BRAD
     So, are you a cheerleader?

          VERONICA
          (dealing with a jerk)
     No, not at all.
          BRAD
     You're pretty enough to be one.

          VERONICA
     Gee, thanks.

          BRAD
     It's so great to be able to talk
     to a girl and not have to ask
     "What's your major?" I hate that.

They uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues.

          BRAD
     So when you go to college, what kind
     of subjects do you think you'll study?

INT. DAVID'S DORM ROOM

HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded
by a PC and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters. They kiss.
DAVID doing most of the work.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Come on David, let's go back to the party.

          DAVID
          (unzipping his pants)
     Don't worry, we will. You're just so
     hot tonight. I can't control myself.

DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down.

INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

BRAD has given up on conversation.

          BRAD
     So what do you say we head up to my
     room and have a real party. I've got the
     best Windham Hill C.D. collection
     in the dorm.

BRAD'S FRIEND approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.

          BRAD'S FRIEND
     Brad-ley, Hennesey's looking for
     you. He says he owes you for blow
     and he just got some product himself.

          BRAD
     You're kidding. That pecker actually
     scored something on his own?

          BRAD'S FRIEND
          (ambling off)
     He's in Sheila's room, big guy. Party up.

          BRAD
     Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?

          VERONICA
     Ever since Phil Collins did that anti-
     drug thing on MTV I refuse everything.

          BRAD
     Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't
     drinking and driving?

          VERONICA
     Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?

          BRAD
     Right. Hey, don't run away now.

With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room
with the coats.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA rampages through her diary.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Seventeen is the last year Mom buys
     the Twinkies. When you make the
     jump from working weekends at Pizza
     Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you
     lose something. Not innocence -- power.

J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary.

          VERONICA
     J.F.K.!

VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm
     allowed an understanding that my
     parents and these Remington University
     assholes have chosen to ignore. I
     understand I must stop Heather.

INT. DORM "COAT" ROOM--NIGHT

Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room. She
draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.

VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily
brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it
touches.

With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka
cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before
tossing the flaming cup out the window.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY--NIGHT

The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...

INT. DORMITORY BATHROOM--NIGHT

A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink
bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some
water and then spits it at her own reflection.

INT. THE DORM "COAT" ROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door.

          BRAD
     How's my little cheerleader? Now I
     know everyone at your high school
     isn't so uptight, come on.

          VERONICA
     Hey really, I don't feel so great.

          BRAD
     Let's do it on the coats. It'll
     be excellent.

BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing.

          VERONICA
     I have a little prepared speech I
     give when my suitor wants more
     than I'd like to give him....
     Gee Blank, I had a nice....

          BRAD
     Save the speeches for Malcom X.
     I just wanna get laid.

          VERONICA
     You don't deserve my fucking speech!

VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed
causing him to slide off onto the floor.

INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees
she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD
slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS,
HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.

BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish. DAVID
whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set down her beer
and walk toward VERONICA.

EXT. DORMITORY ALLEY--NIGHT

The fire in the trashcan is raging.

INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with
VERONICA.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     What's your damage? Brad says
     you're being a real cooze.

          VERONICA
     Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going
     to throw up. Can we jam, please?

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     No. Hell no.

VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings herself
down off-screen with some ugly wretching sounds.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Betty Finn was a true friend and I
     sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs
     and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd
     be like offing the Wicked Witch of the
     West. Or is it East? West! I sound
     like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing
     her aerobicized ass but tonight let me
     dream of a world without Heather. A
     world where I am free.

INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth. A
smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss. VERONICA
runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.

EXT. DORMITORY ALLEY--NIGHT

VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a
screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan
bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     You stupid cunt!

          VERONICA
     You goddamn bitch!

The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic
light.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     You were nothing before you met me!
     You were playing Barbies with Betty
     Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a
     Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout
     Cookie! I got you into a Remington
     Party! What's my thanks? It's on the
     hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!

          VERONICA
     Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
          (totally in control)
     Monday morning, you're history. I'll
     tell everyone about tonight. Transfer
     to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson.
     No one at Westerburg's going to let
     you play their reindeer games.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the
wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.

          J.D.
     Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.

          VERONICA
          (exhaling deeply)
     S'okay....

          J.D.
     I saw the croquet set-up in the back.
     Up for a match?

VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems
ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....

          VERONICA
     Sure. But I'm Blue.

EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT

The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's
backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
together by the first wicket.

          J.D. (V.O.)
     Goddamn, no wonder you looked so
     mangled when I came through the window.

Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     I've always treated Heather's teen
     queen power plays as bullshit.....

As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a rugged
shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     But I'm really scared. Who am I going
     to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound
     like an Afterschool Special.

The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
resting side by side at another wicket.

          J.D. (V.O.)
     That was my first game of Strip
     Croquet, you know. I thank you.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     You're welcome. It's a lot more
     interesting than just flinging
     off your clothes and boning away
     on the neighbor's swing set.

VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her
panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.

          J.D. (O.S.)
     Well, I don't know. There's
     something to be said for...Ouch!

VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an artful
pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss. VERONICA
breaks off to uneasily giggle.

          VERONICA
     What a night.

J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on
it, closing her eyes tightly.

          VERONICA
     What a life. I almost moved into high
     school out of sixth grade because I
     was some genius. We all decided to
     chuck the idea because I'd have
     trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.

VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and
gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she
murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.

          VERONICA
     Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use
     my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss
     to wear and how to hit three keggers
     before curfew. Some genius.

          J.D.
     Heather Chandler is one bitch that
     deserves to die.

          VERONICA
     Killing her won't solve anything.

          J.D.
     A well-timed lightning bolt through
     her window and Monday morning, all
     the other heathers, shit, everybody
     would be cast fucking adrift.

          VERONICA
     Well then, I'll pray for rain.

          J.D.
     See the condoms in the grass over
     there. We killed tonight, Veronica.
     We murdered our baby.

          VERONICA
     Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.

          J.D.
     Just saying it's not hard to end a life.

          VERONICA
     There's a big difference between
     the most popular girl in the school
     and dead sperm.

They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.

          J.D.
     I guess I don't know what the hell
     I'm talking about.

          VERONICA
     I know exactly what the hell you're
     talking about and you're right, you
     don't know what the hell you're
     talking about. Let's just grow up,
     be adults, and die.

          J.D.
     Good plan.

          VERONICA
     But before that, I'd like to see
     Heather Chandler puke her guts out.

INT. HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLER's bedroom is lushly and expensively furnished
with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching centerpiece.
HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted bedsheets as MRS.
CHANDLER'S VOICE attacks through the door.

          MRS. CHANDLER (O.S.)
     We are leaving soon for your
     grandmother's. If you care to join us...

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Bag that.

          MRS. CHANDLER (O.S.)
     Is that a "No" in your lingo?

HEATHER CHANDLER gives the voice behind the door "the finger."

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Lingo this.

INT. THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY

The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door.

          VERONICA
          (quietly)
     Trust me. She skips the Saturday
     morning trip to Grandma's even
     when she's not hungover.

          J.D.
     Then let's just concoct ourselves a
     little hangover cure that'll induce
     her to spew red, white, and blue.

VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard
beneath the sink.

          VERONICA
     What about orange juice and milk?
     What's the upchuck factor on that?

J.D. holds up a bottle of cleaning fluid.

          J.D.
     I'm a No Rust Build-up man, myself.

          VERONICA
     Don't be a dick. That stuff'll
     kill her.

VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends
back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as
J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers
(detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.

          VERONICA
     O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put
     it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it
     be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?

          J.D.
     Man Veronica, pull the plug on that
     shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own
thoughts.

          VERONICA
     What are you doing? You just
     can't go.....Besides, she'd never
     drink anything that looks like that.

          J.D.
     Okay we'll use this. She won't be
     able to tell what she's drinking.

J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the
poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause
ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of
orange juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily
muttering.

          VERONICA
     Just give me a cup, jerk.

J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA
tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
juice into the cup.

          VERONICA
     Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe
     we could cough a phlegm globber in
     it or something.

          J.D.
     Yeah, great.

They both start coughing harshly.

          VERONICA
     No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll
     do quite nicely. Quite nicely.

          J.D.
     Chick-en.

          VERONICA
     You're not funny.

J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down
at the mess of toxic containers.

With both arms, VERONICA clumps the toxic containers together
and drops beneath the sink to put them away. J.D. swaggers
back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs back into view.

          J.D.
     I'm sorry.

J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes
with a grudging smile.

          VERONICA
     Bonehead.

VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups.

Not the one with milk and orange juice in it.

INT. HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D.
enter.

          VERONICA
     Morning, Heather.

Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle
     surprise. Hear about Veronica's
     affection for regurgitation?

          VERONICA
     We both said a lot of things we
     didn't mean, last night.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?

          J.D.
     Veronica knew you'd have a hangover.
     So I whipped this up. Family recipe.

J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Did you put a phlegm globber in it
     or something? I'm not drinking that piss.

          J.D.
     I knew this stuff would be too intense.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink
     it just because you call me chicken.

They do. They're right.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Just give me the cup, jerk.

HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in
anger. She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it
all.

She then launches her head forward, her face contorted in
agony.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Corn nuts!

HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes
through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze.

          J.D.
     Something tells me you picked up
     the wrong cup.

          VERONICA
     No shit, sherlock. I can't believe
     it. I just killed my best friend.

          J.D.
     And your worst enemy.

          VERONICA
     Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

VERONICA staggers to a desk. J.D. laughs out of shock.

          J.D.
     What are we going to tell the cops?
     "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

          VERONICA
     Stop kidding around. The police....oh
     no, oh God....I can't believe this is
     my life..I'm going to have to send my
     S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead
     of Stanford.

          J.D.
     I'm just a little freaked, all right?
          (a beat)
     You got what you wanted, you know.

          VERONICA
     Don't say that! It's one thing to
     want somebody out of your life. It's
     another thing to serve them a wake-up
     cup of Liquid Drainer....Don't say....

VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He
scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees
Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming
"THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" under HEATHER CHANDLER's body.

          J.D.
     We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime.
     But if this was like a suicide thing.....

          VERONICA
     Like a suicide thing?

          J.D.
     Adolescence is a period of life
     fraught with anxiety and confusion.

          VERONICA
          (calming down)
     I can do Heather's handwriting as
     well as my own.

VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins
writing, calling out her words.

          VERONICA
     "You might think what I've done is
     shocking..."

          J.D.
     "To me though, suicide is the
     natural answer to the myriad
     of problems life has given me."

          VERONICA
     That's good, but Heather would
     never use the word "myriad."

          J.D.
     This is the last thing she'll ever
     write. She'll want to cash in on as
     many fifty-cent words as poss.

          VERONICA
     She missed "myriad" on a vocab
     test two weeks ago, all right?

          J.D.
     That only proves my point more. The word
     is a badge for her failures at school.

          VERONICA
     You're probably right..."People think
     just because you're beautiful and
     popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody
     understood I had feelings too."

          J.D.
     "I die knowing no one knew the real me."

          VERONICA
     That's good. Have you done this before?

VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S corpse.

INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike
PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but
savvy MRS. POPE, the yuppie black counselor PAUL HYDE, TWO
large DISCIPLINARIAN-TYPES, and most noticeably, the
eccentrically dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs
and cigarette smoke is in the air, as the group batters their
way through a morning mourning conference.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Any other Principal would take the same
     position. Keep things business as usual.

          COUNSELOR HYDE
     Heather Chandler's not your everyday
     suicide. She was very popular.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Come on Paul, I let the kids go before
     lunch and the switchboard'll light up
     like a Christmas Tree.

          COUNSELOR HYDE
     The parents will be sympathetic, sir.
     These are troubled times for the young.

          MRS. POPE
     I must say I was impressed to see
     that she made proper use of the word
     "myriad" in her suicide note after
     brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.

          PAULINE
          (dramatically cutting in)
     I find it profoundly disturbing that
     we are told of a tragic destruction
     of youth and all we can talk about
     is adequate mourning times and
     misused vocabulary words.

A collective sigh goes across the room.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Oh Christ.

          PAULINE
     The school, meaning both students
     and teachers, must revel in this
     revealing moment. I suggest we get
     everyone into the cafeteria and
     just talk. And feel. Together.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me
     when the shuttle lands...Now is
     this Heather the cheerleader?

          COUNSELOR HYDE
     That would be Heather Mcnamara.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Damn. I'd be willing to go half a
     day for a cheerleader.

          MRS. POPE
     Let's just pack it in an hour early.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Done. I hate Mondays.

INT. PAULINE FLEMING'S CLASSROOM--DAY

The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an
amusingly chaotic position by PAULINE'S PUPILS. She is
furious.

          PAULINE
     I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget
     it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled
     to be given an example of everything
     I've taught you. That example is
     Heather Chandler. I have the note!

PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS.

          MALE STUDENT
     Awright!

          PAULINE
     I'll pass the suicide note around
     the room so you can feel its tragic
     beauty for yourself. Let us share
     together the feelings the suicide has
     spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?

          FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JAKET
     I heard it was really gnarly. She sucked
     down a bowl of multi-purpose deodorizing
     disinfectant then she smashed....

          PAULINE
     Now, now, we're not here to rehash
     the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions.

          ALL-OUT NERD
     Are we going to be tested on this?

A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks.
The note continues to be breathlessly passed around.

          PETER
     Heather and I used to go together,
     but she said I was boring. I realize
     now I wasn't really boring. She was
     just dissatisfied with her life.

          PAULINE
     That's very good Peter.

VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by
putting her hands over her face.

          PAULINE
     Dear Veronica, Heather was your
     soulmate.....Share.

          VERONICA
     Heather was cool, but cruel. The good
     looks and bad manners gave her power,
     but it could not give her happiness.

The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to
her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then
continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a
captive audience.

          VERONICA
     She realized the only way she could
     be happy was to give up her power and
     the only way she could do that was Death.

PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles.

INT. THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY

The GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so
     unfair! We should get a whole week
     off not just an hour.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Write the School Board.

HEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks.

          VERONICA
     Watch it, Heather. You could actually
     be digesting food.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Yeah, where's your urge to purge?

          HEATHER DUKE
          (belching)
     Fuck it.

HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Look, heather left behind one of her
     Swatches. She'd want you to have it,
     Veronica. She always said you couldn't
     accessorize for shit.

HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who
stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY
JACKET stops next to their bench.

          FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
     I'm sorry about your friend. I thought
     she was your usual airhead bitch.
     Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were.

HEATHER DUKE bobs up from the world's largest sno-cone.

          HEATHER DUKE
     What a waste.

VERONICA zombiesquely moves into the shower area.

          HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)
     Oh the Humanity.

INT. THE SHOWER--DAY

VERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against
her clothes.

INT. THE LOCKER ROOM--DAY

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Veronica, what are you doing?

          SQUEALING GIRL (O.S.)
     Everyone in the shower!

TWO GIGGLING GIRLS run into the shower fully clothed. THREE
OTHERS follow suit. The HEATHERS look to each other, laugh,
and run in.

INT. THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE--DAY

Heavy Metalers MATT, CLYDE, and STEVE plus Geek RODNEY sneak
into a darkened room. Girls' laughter drifts in.

          MATT
     Do I deliver or do I deliver?

          RODNEY
     Hurry up, we're going to get caught.

          MATT
     Mellow out Geek. Man, I never
     should have brought you.

          CLYDE
     Let's see some pussy!

MATT pulls a curtain revealing a semi-overhead view of the
showering and clothed GIRLS.

INT. THE SHOWER--DAY

The GIRLS splash and spin in balletlike slow motion. VERONICA
stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached.

INT. THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE--DAY

Cautiously quiet pandemonium.

          MATT
     Does this have something to do with
     menstrual cramps and shit?

          CLYDE
          (dazed)
     What the fuck?

          RODNEY
     We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I
     can feel it.

          CLYDE
     What the fuck?

EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

Pulling their coats over their wet clothes, VERONICA and the
HEATHERS come out of the school.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     That was seriously warped, Veronica.

          VERONICA
     Uh-huh.

          HEATHER DUKE
     T.V. cameras!

In the distance, a T.V. CAMERA CREW is interviewing STUDENTS.
HEATHER DUKE dashes toward them. HEATHER MCNAMARA freezes.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!

HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward
the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch
on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a neaby trashcan.

INT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON

A massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE posed by a
tree, talking into a microphone.

          HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)
     I choose to remember the good times.
     Like when we got our ears pierced
     at the mall.

The image of HEATHER MCNAMARA sitting in the grass talking
into a microphone supersedes HEATHER DUKE's.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.)
     I can still hear those late night
     talks on the phone.

The image of PETER DAWSON sitting on a rock comes on next.

          PETER (T.V.)
     The day I won her that stuffed rhino
     at the 4-H Fair, she said to me....

          VERONICA (O.S.)
     You're an asshole! Mute him!

VERONICA and J.D. are seen to be crashed on a couch. J.D.
pushes a button on the remote control, cutting the sound.

          J.D.
     Mute!

          VERONICA
     Next channel, darling.

The silent image of HEATHER DUKE on a staircase talking into a
microphone is on the screen.

          VERONICA (O.S.)
     Heather, how many networks did
     you run to!

Country Club Courtney appears wearing a T-shirt reading BIGFUN.
VERONICA takes the remote and turns the sound on.

          VERONICA
     Oh, I have to hear this.

          COURTNEY (T.V.)
     In my heart, Heather's still alive.

          VERONICA
          (muting Courtney)
     What are you talking about? She
     hated you! You hated her!
          (to J.D.)
     What are you smiling at?

          J.D.
     Heather Chandler is more popular
     than ever now.

          VERONICA
     Yeah. Scary stuff.

J.D. suddenly looks away from VERONICA with a mischievous
half-smile. He inexplicably calls out.

          J.D.
     Why son, I didn't hear you come in.

J.D.'s father BIG BUD DEAN, stands before them, handsome and
threatening in a shirt and tie. He is rather malevolently
holding a rowing machine.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     Hey Dad, how was work today?

BIG BUD slams down his rowing machine and straddles it before
answering his own question. He rows as he speaks. The Brady
Bunch sputters on the T.V. screen before him.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     It was miserable. Some damn tribe of
     withered old bitches doesn't want us
     to terminate that fleabag hotel. All
     because Glenn Miller and his band once
     took a shit there. It's just like
     Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?

          J.D.
     That was the one with wheat right?

          BIG BUD DEAN
     The Save the Memorial Oak Tree
     Society. Showed those fucks.

J.D. turns to VERONICA with a bemused smile.

          J.D.
     Thirty Fourth of July fireworks
     attached to the trunk. Arraigned
     but Acquitted.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost
     forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

          J.D.
     Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica.

          VERONICA
     Hello.

VERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked BUD's hand.
He extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing
hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh.

          J.D.
     Jason, why don't you ask your
     little friend to stay for dinner.

          VERONICA
          (awkwardly standing)
     My Mom's making my favorite meal
     tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

          J.D.
     Nice. The last time I saw my Mom,
     she was waving out the window of a
     library in Texas. Right, Dad?

BIG BUD DEAN stops rowing to grin a You-Think-You're-
Tougher-Than-Me-But-You're-Not smile to J.D.

          BIG BUD DEAD
     Right, son.

          VERONICA
          (weakly)
     Right.

EXT. THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK

Just as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are
seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them. Pate
is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette.

          DAD
     Take a break Veronica, sit down.

VERONICA walks into view and sits down.

          VERONICA
     All right.

          DAD
     So what was the first day after
     Heather's suicide like?

          VERONICA
     I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

          MOM
     Terrible thing. So will we get to
     meet this dark horse prom contender?

          VERONICA
     Maybe.

          DAD
          (looking at his cigarette)
     Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
     me why I smoke these damn things?

          VERONICA
          (smiling)
     Because you're an idiot.

          DAD
     Oh yeah, that's it.

DAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin.

          MOM
          (shaking her head)
     You two....

          VERONICA
     Greate pate, but I'm going to have
     to motor if I want to be ready for
     the funeral tomorrow.

INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY

A montage commences showing the HEATHERS preparing for the
funeral. HEATHER MCNAMARA models an all-black outfit in front
of a dressing table mirror. She storms away, pouting.

INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY

Bobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is
FUNERAL CHIC, HEATHER DUKE finishes applying black lipstick. A
look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs
her lips.

INT. CHURCH--DAY

A MORTICIAN puts the finishing touches on HEATHER CHANDLER,
smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face. He gently
kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot.

INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY

HEATHER MCNAMARA models another black outfit. She responds
this time with a satisfied smile.

INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY

Traditionally made up, a smiling HEATHER DUKE brings a
crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it.

INT. CHURCH--DAY

HEATHER CHANDLER serenely lies in a coffin as FATHER RIPPER
bellows off-screen. A panorama of ADULTS and STUDENTS is
revealed at this more social than spiritual event. VERONICA
and J.D. watch from the back pew.

          FATHER RIPPER (O.S.)
     I blame not Heather but rather a
     society that tells its youth that
     the answers are on the MTV video
     games. We must pray the other
     teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio, know
     the name of that "righteous dude"
     who can solve their problems....

The bald FATHER RIPPER finally comes into view.

          FATHER RIPPER
          (cont'd)
     It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

KNEELING PODIUM BEFORE COFFIN--LATER

BETTY FINN is kneeling before HEATHER CHANDLER'S open coffin.
The viewer hears what she is thinking.

          BETTY (V.O.)
     May Heather Chandler rest in peace
     even though she committed suicide.
     For-the-kingdom-the-power-and-the-
     glory-are-yours-now-and-forever-Amen.

BETTY FINN makes the sign of the cross, rises, and exits.
HEATHER MCNAMARA takes her place on the kneeling podium.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA (V.O.)
     Oh God, this is a tragic thing and
     sometimes I have a hard time dealing
     with it and stuff. Please send Heather
     to heaven and all that. Thanks. I
     mean, Amen.

HEATHER MCNAMARA exits and PETER DAWSON moves in her place.

          PETER (V.O.)
     Dear God, make sure this never
     happens to me. I do not think I
     could handle suicide and that's
     the God's honest truth. Pardon
     the pun. Fast-early-acceptance-
     into-an-Ivy-League-school-and-
     please-let-it-be-Harvard. Amen.

PETER flees and RAM uncomfortably takes his place.

          RAM (V.O.)
     Jesus God in heaven, uh, why did
     you kill such hot snatch. That's
     a joke, man. People are so serious.
          (a beat)
     Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,
     pray for us sinners....so we don't
     get caught. Another joke, man.

RAM clumsily exits. HEATHER DUKE solemnly kneels in his place.

          HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)
     I prayed for the death of Heather
     Chandler many times and I felt bad
     every time I did, but I kept doing
     it anyway. Now I know you understood
     everything. Praise Jesus. Alleluia.

HEATHER DUKE departs and VERONICA kneels in her place.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Hi. I'm sorry. Technically I didn't
     kill Heather Chandler but hey, who
     am I trying to kid, right? I just
     want my high school to be a nice
     place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy?

CHURCH LOBBY

HEATHER MCNAMARA dips a big comb in the holy water basin and
then combs out her hair. VERONICA breezes by.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Veronica. What are you doing tonight?

          VERONICA
     Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Ram asked me out, but he wants to
     double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't
     have a date.

          VERONICA
     Heather, I've got something
     going with J.D.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on
     hold tonight, I'll never forget it.

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT--DAY

KURT KELLY and RAM stand by RAM'S van.

          KURT
     We on tonight, man?

          RAM
     I still got to talk to Heather,
     dude. Weird funeral, huh?

          KURT
     Pretty weird.

Geeks RODNEY and BRACES thrust by KURT and RAM. BRACES
obliviously steps on KURT's foot.

          KURT
     That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

          RAM
     Let's kick his ass.

          KURT
     Cool off, we're seniors.

          RAM
     Goddamn Geek!

BRACES gives them "the finger".

          BRACES
          (awkwardly defiant)
     Sit and spin.

KURT and RAM turn to each other more amused than angered.

          KURT
     That little prick.

The bolting Jocks effortlessly catch BRACES and put him into a
hunched-over position. The other Geeks look on, ashamed.

          KURT
     All right you piece of shit fag,
     do you like to suck big dicks?

          BRACES
     Cut it out!

RAM pushes BRACES down harder.

          KURT
     Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.

          RODNEY
     Leave him alone, Kurt.

J.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT,
wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that reads
THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked.

          RAM (O.S.)
     Say it!

          BRACES
     Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.

Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries.

          BRACES
     I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm!
     I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?

          KURT
     I'm sure your friends are happy
     to hear that.
          (with a lisp)
     Right, guys?

ANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT

VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet
     lately, consoling me and stuff.
     It'll be really very. Promise.

Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off
his face as his friends glumly watch on.

          VERONICA
     All right, but I hope it isn't
     going to be one of those nights where
     they get shitfaced and take us to a
     pasture to tip cows.

EXT. COW PASTURE--NIGHT

A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM
scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA and
HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.

          KURT
     Is it sleeping, dude?

          RAM
     I think so, man.

          KURT
     Then get over on my side. Oh shit,
     cowtipping is the fucking greatest.

          RAM
     Punch it in!

KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the
COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but
VERONICA glares it away.

          KURT
     Count of three, guy.

          KURT AND RAM
     One. Two. Three!

An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes
against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA.

DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT

KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.

          KURT
     "When I get that feeling, I need
     sexual healing....."

          VERONICA
     Yeah, right, asshole.

VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately
stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's
intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline.
Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT
squints up the hill and falls over backwards.

          J.D.
     What is this shit?

          VERONICA
     I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I
     tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.

          KURT
          (still face down)
     "Feel like making bah da dah bah da
     dah, feel like making love."

          J.D.
     Another fucking Heather.
          (harshly laughs)
     I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior
     tonight. Seven high schools in seven
     states and the only thing different
     was my locker combination. We've broke
     through the peer pressure cooker. So
     what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..

VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.

          VERONICA
     So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!

          J.D.
     Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn,
takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.

          KURT
     "And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."

INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and YEARBOOK GIRL
ALISON confer over a layout sheet. Alison wears a walkman and
BIG FUN T-shirt. PETER DAWSON pouts behind them.

          DENNIS
     I'm not belittling the Foodless Fund,
     Peter, but we're talking teen suicide!
     Ask Alison here, the number one song
     right now is "Teenage Suicide (Don't Do
     It)" by BigFun. Jesus man, Westerburg
     finally got one of these things and I'm
     not going to blow it.

          PETER
     Great. Heather gets the headline and I
     get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

VERONICA breezes in.

          VERONICA
     Hi Guys. I came to check on this
     week's lunchtime poll topic.

          DENNIS
     Don't worry about it, Veronica,
     sit down. That funeral yesterday
     must have been really rough.

          VERONICA
     Oh. Sure.

          DENNIS
     We were, uh, wondering if maybe you
     had some poems or artwork that
     Heather did that we could put in
     the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

          VERONICA
     The what?

          DENNIS
     Take a look. We'll have a two page
     layout with her suicide note up
     here in the right hand corner. It's
     more tasteful than it sounds.

Country Club COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND come in giggling
and whispering. Seeing VERONICA, they stop dead, then slide
into chairs, laughing softly.

          VERONICA
     I don't know. This thing leaves a
     bad taste in my mouth.

          COURTNEY
     Like last night, Veronica?

COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND explode in laughter.

          VERONICA
     I'm sorry? I don't get it.

          COURTNEY
     You did last night. Kurt told us of
     your little date.

          VERONICA
     Yeah. And? I left him drunk and
     flailing in cowshit.

          COURTNEY
     I don't know. He was really detailed.

          PETER
     Shut up, Courtney.

          VERONICA
     Don't shut up. I'd like to know just
     what I did.

          PETER
          (gesturing to the door)
     Let me show you that lunchtime
     poll topic, Veronica.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE WORKSHOP--DAY

PETER tells VERONICA.

          PETER
     I rarely listen to Neanderthals like
     Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were
     bent over like a coffee table with
     Kurt going in one end and Ram coming
     in the other. Pardon the pun.

          VERONICA
          (dazed)
     Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.

Dizzy, VERONICA hands a clump of dollar bills to PETER.

          VERONICA
     Thanks Pete, for the Foodless Fund.

PETER cheerfully pockets the cash as VERONICA drifts off.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.

          VERONICA
     Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I
     didn't expect to be calling either. I
     guess my emotions took over. I was
     wondering if you wanted all those
     things you've been saying to really
     happen. It's always been a fantasy of
     mine to have two guys at once......
     Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.

Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud.
VERONICA throws a book at him.

          VERONICA
     That's right. In the woods behind the
     school. At Dawn. And don't forget Ram.

INT. THE KELLY KITCHEN--NIGHT

KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.

          KURT
     Women.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA breaks
into a laugh.

          VERONICA
     I don't get the point of me writing
     a suicide note when we'll just be
     shooting them with blanks.

          J.D.
     Get crucial. We won't be using
     blanks this time.

          VERONICA
     You can't be serious? Hey listen,
     my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.

VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed.
With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.

          J.D.
     Do you take German?

          VERONICA
     French.

J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.

          J.D.
     These are Ich Luge bullets. My
     grandfather snared a shitload of
     them in W.W. Two. They're like
     tranquilizers only they break the
     surface of the skin, enough to
     cause blood, but not any real harm.

          VERONICA
     So it looks like the person's been
     shot and killed when they're really
     just unconscious and bleeding.

J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.

          J.D.
     We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look
     like they shot each other. By the time
     Kurt and Ram regain consciousness,
     they'll be the laughingstock's of the
     school. The note's the punchline.
     How'd it turn out?

VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also
plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of
the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both
papers.

          VERONICA
     First tell me this similarity is
     not incredible.

          J.D.
          (warmly)
     Incredible similarity.

VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.

          VERONICA
     Ram and I died the day we realized
     we could never reveal our forbidden
     love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
     world. The joy we shared in each other's
     arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet
     we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-
     Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.

          J.D.
     Exquisite, but I don't think
     ununderstanding is a word.

          VERONICA
     We don't want to make them out to be
     too secretly eloquent. Why would the
     Germans invent a bullet that doesn't
     kill people? I mean it was World War
     Two, not a school play.

          J.D.
          (rapid-fire)
     They used them on themselves to
     make it look like they were dead.
     Really quite a brilliant device, but
     too flamboyant to seriously produce.

          VERONICA
     Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.

VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable
tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.

          J.D.
     It doesn't work on small animals!

          VERONICA
     Oh.

          J.D.
     Uh well hey, let's take a look at the
     homosexual artifacts I dug up to plant
     at the scene. Now prepare to be a
     little disappointed.

J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the
contents on the bed.

          J.D.
     We've got an issue of Stud Puppy, a
     candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card,
     and some mascara.

          VERONICA
     You must have had fun.

          J.D.
     You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot.
     The one perfecto thing I picked up...

J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises
out two bottles of Perrier water.

          J.D.
     Perrier water!

          VERONICA
     Oh come on. Lots of people drink
     Perrier. It's come a long way.

          J.D.
     This is Ohio. If you don't have a
     brewsky in your hand you might as
     well be wearing a dress.

          VERONICA
          (mock-seductively)
     Oh, you're so smart. How about a
     little heterosexuality before we go?

J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAWN

A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk
through the misty parking lot toward the woods.

          RAM
          (singing)
     Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever
     need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello
     Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...

          KURT
     Shut the fuck up, all right.

          RAM
     Lighten up, dude. In those woods is
     some of the finest pussy in the school
     and we don't even have to buy it a
     hamburger and a Diet Coke. What a way
     to start the day! Punch it in!

KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS--DAWN

VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods. She
nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT and
RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.

          KURT
     Hi Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (forced cheerfulness)
     Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.

RAM smacks his hands together.

          RAM
     So do we just start fucking?

          VERONICA
     I've made a circle on each end of
     the clearing. Ram, you come over here.

KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.
A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at
the opposite end of the foggy clearing.

          VERONICA


The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.

          RAM
     What about you?

          VERONICA
     I was hoping you'd rip my clothes
     off me, sport.

          RAM
     Oh. Good idea.

KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.

          VERONICA
     Count of three, guys.

RAM giggles in anticipation.

          VERONICA
     One.

KURT finally cracks a smile.

          VERONICA
     Two.

J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his
right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.

          J.D.
     Three.

J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead. VERONICA
rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using both hands,
she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs away onto the
path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.

          VERONICA
     Shucks.

J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.

          J.D.
     Did you miss him completely?

          VERONICA
          (giggling)
     Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth
     it just to see the look on....

          J.D.
     Don't move! I'll get him back!

VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling
and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.

THE PATH

A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.

OFF THE PATH

J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees and fog.

THE CLEARING

VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.

THE PATH

KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly
moves into the opening and raises his gun. KURT runs back...

THE CLEARING

VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He
does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding and
dead, dead, dead.

KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.

          J.D.
     Now!

In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips
around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.

INT. SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAWN

Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car
already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER
shouts.

          MILNER
     I heard it that time!

          McCORD
     Wha?

          MILNER
     Another gunshot! From the woods!

          McCORD
     Shit, let's roll.

The two officer explode out of the car.

EXT. THE CLEARING--DAWN

J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA
zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.

          VERONICA
     Kurt doesn't look too good.

          J.D.
     Remember he's left-handed.

A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.

          MILNER (O.S.)
     Keep going until you hit the clearing!

J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run
into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into the
clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.

          McCORD
     Mother of Shit!

          MILNER
     Call in!

MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.

          MILNER
     I heard something out there. I'm
     checking it out.

MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is
holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.

          McCORD
     This is Officer McCord and I've got
     two dead bodies in the woods behind
     Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of
     them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.

EXT. IN THE WOODS--DAWN

VERONICA and J.D. flow through thick trees. An Owl hoos.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS--DAWN

MILNER blindly barrels through the dense, foggy woods.

EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS--DAWN

VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and race up a dew
drenched hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.

          J.D.
     Faster!

EXT. IN THE WOODS--DAWN

MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.

EXT. THE HILL--DAWN

VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.

MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam
the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin
taking off their clothes.

EXT. THE HILL--DAWN

MILNER continues to move up the hill.

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR--DAWN

MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-
talkie startles him.

          McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
     Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?

MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-
talkie.

          MILNER
     Think what I heard was just a
     stinking owl. All I got is two kids
     making out in the backseat of a
     car. Should I pry them apart?

          McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
     Forget it. I got all the answers
     back here, partner. Boy, kids today
     sure start in early. Hey, are they naked?

MILNER sighs, and clicks off his walkie-talkie.

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They
catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.

EXT. THE CLEARING--DAWN

MILNER runs back into the clearing.

          MILNER
     What's the deal?

          McCORD
     Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot
     each other.

          MILNER
     That's Kurt Kelly!

          McCORD
     Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

          MILNER
     Oh my God, suicide? Why?

          McCORD
     Does this answer your question?

McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the
bottles of Perrier water.

          MILNER
     Oh man, they were fags!

          McCORD
     Listen up, "We could never reveal our
     forbidden love to an uncaring and
     ununderstanding world."

          MILNER
     Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Sherwood
     Sunday Insert Honorable Mention...

MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.

          MILNER
     Wait a second. How did they shoot
     each other if we heard two separate
     sets of gunshots?

          McCORD
     I always hear gunshots when I'm high
     before noon. Life's a crazy bitch.
     Don't try to analyze it. The quarterback
     buggering the linebacker. What a waste.

          MILNER
     Oh the humanity.

INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--MORNING

Another morning mourning conference. The participants look a
little more frazzled. PAULINE sits at the head of the table.

          COUNSELOR HYDE
          (sotto voce to Mrs. Pope)
     After every touchdown or whatever,
     they give each other a little slap
     on the bottom. It seems innocent...

          PAULINE (O.S.)
     Shut up.

The elderly MRS. POPE shakes her head at the suicide note.

          MRS. POPE
     Look at this. "Ununderstanding."

          PAULINE
     Will you shut up! We were in a
     similar position Monday and I
     thoughtfully suggested that we get
     the students together for an
     unadulterated emotional outpouring.
     You took the suggestion as an
     opportunity to play yet another round
     of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."

          COUNSELOR HYDE
     Pauline, if you want a tryout
     for the school play....

PRINCIPAL GOWAN hoarsely breaks in.

          PRINCIPAL GOWAN
     Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of
     bullshit--angel dust, switchblades,
     sexually perverse photography
     exhibits involving tennis racquets,
     but this suicide thing....I guess
     it's all on Pauline's wavelength.
     We're just going to write off today,
     and Friday she can do her little
     little love-in or whatever. Whatever.

EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING

VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.
Slowly other cars begin to filter in, including a rumbling heap-
ful of Heavy Metalers.

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--MORNING

The Heavy Metaler Heap's obnoxious muffler causes a sleeping
VERONICA's eyes to snap open in bug-eyed sweat. Mentally
wounded, she climbs into the front seat, pulling on her
blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D.
rumbles from the back as more cars begin to fill the lot.

          VERONICA
     We killed them, didn't we?

          J.D.
     Of course.

VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm
of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the
lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh of
VERONICA's hand as she wails away.

          VERONICA
     Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!

J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in
outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.

          J.D.
     You believed it because you wanted
     to believe it. Your true feelings were
     too gross and icky for you to face.

          VERONICA
     I did not want them dead.

          J.D.
     Did too.

          VERONICA
     Did not.

          J.D.
     Did too.

          VERONICA
     Did not.

J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-too's".
VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and
singing "Mary had a Little Lamb." J.D.'s "Did-too's" get
louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.

EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering
through the parking lot to contemplate Veronica's hiccuping
car and its sparring occupants.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Ah, young love.

COURTNEY bounds up to the Heathers.

          SQUEELING GIRL #1
     Did you hear? School's cancelled today
     because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in
     a repressed homosexual suicide pact.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (incredulous, but amused)
     No way!

INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAY

J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit
cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes
the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.

          J.D.
     Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt
     and Ram had nothing to offer the school
     but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.

          VERONICA
          (looking to her burnt hand)
     Sure. Can we make an ice run
     before the funeral?

STUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out.

INT. CHURCH--DAY

A typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY,
stands over his son's open coffin. KURT wears a black football
helmet. FATHER RIPPER watches on with various ADULTS,
STUDENTS.

          MR. KELLY
     If there's any way you can hear me,
     Kurt buddy, I don't care that you
     really were some pansy. You're my
     flesh-and-blood. You made me proud.
     I love my homosexual son. My son's
     gay and I love him!

In dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D.

          VERONICA
     Your son's dead and you love him.

          J.D.
     How do you think Mr. Kelly would
     react to a son with a limp wrist
     with a pulse?

They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at
her. She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is
soaked in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated
grimace.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM FLOOR--NIGHT

VERONICA lies next to a Vodka bottle, drinking out of a Dixie
cup. She turns off her blaring radio to speak on the phone.

          D.J. (radio)
     As you know, the Sherwood Teen Suicide
     tote is up to three. Here's one for Kurt
     and Ram, BigFun with Teenage Suicide,
     Don't Do It....

          VERONICA
     Hello J.D.? No, it's okay, I just kind
     of wanted to talk...Oh, a newsmagazine
     show on Channel 16. Really? On the
     suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.

VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against
the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches
up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen.
She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit
     now has a body count.

Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as
J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.

           VERONICA (V.O.)
     The most popular people in the school
     are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a
     good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather
     depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I
     gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing
     but what really frightens me is that
     I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do
     next. It's God versus my boyfriend
     and God's losing....

VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out
her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the
floor and curls into a fetal slumber.

INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY

STUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are
wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars.

PAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER
DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.

          PAULINE
     Peter, kill the jukebox.

As the music amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up
a bullhorn to her lips and crackles...

          PAULINE
     Could I have your attention?

A startled Geek RODNEY splatters milk all over himself.

STUDENTS whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria.
MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK warily looks up from her plate.

PAULINE FLEMING chants with soaring self-importance.

          PAULINE
     Our school has been torn apart by
     tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it
     back together through Togetherness.
     I want everyone to clasp hands.
     We need to connect this cafeteria
     into one mighty circuit.

A tableau of dumbfounded STUDENTS stare at the Bullhorn Woman.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA--SAME TIME--DAY

Hungover in dark sunglasses, VERONICA bustles toward the
cafeteria entrance clinging to an armful of books while trying
to tie a black armband onto herself.

INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY

PAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling.

          PAULINE
     Yo, what's the problem? I know you
     know how to hold hands. Ring-around-
     the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it!
          (looking to her watch then Peter)
     Where are they?

Her back to the viewer, VERONICA enters the cafeteria. HEATHER
DUKE floats into view and tightly knots VERONICA's armband.

          VERONICA
     I see Ms. Phlegm's on another crusade.
     With usual success.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (looking to the viewer)
     I have a feeling this one'll work.

VERONICA turns to the viewer and half-gasps.

TWO 2-person video CAMERA CREWS and a STILL PHOTOGRAPHER burst
into the cafeteria slightly battering the in-the-way VERONICA.

PAULINE smiles in relief. She wields around, lifting the horn.

          PAULINE
     The cameras are here! Lock your paws!

Slightly confused but Awesomed, a table of Country Club Kids
including COURTNEY stand and latch out to each other. A nearby
table with BETTY FINN and friends follow suit.

VERONICA looks on with a growing sense of queasiness.

The Cafeteria swirls into a frenzy with members of more
excitable cliques like the Jocks and the Heavy Metalers
jumping over and onto tables anxiously bumbling into hand-
holding constellations. CAMERA CREWS weave beside them.
In a corner, the PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot of a thumbs-up
PETER DAWSON with his arms around FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET.

PAULINE runs ahead of a hustling CAMERA CREW and grabs hold of
a chain of hand-holding Jocks. She pulls the chain until it
connects up with a grateful chain of BETTY FINNS.

A sleeping HEATHER MCNAMARA drearily awakens to the havoc around
her. She takes off her black armband, ties it around her
eyes, and droops her head back down on a table.

VERONICA lets her books slide from her hands, shaking her head.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK nervously looks to her out-of-control peers.

HEATHER DUKE slyly looks to VERONICA with an "If you can't
beat em..." smile then saunters into the fray. She slides onto
the lap of Heavy Metaler Matt. The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot.

PAULINE forces apart the handholding Heavy Metal lovers JACKIE
and STEVE, sandwiches DENNIS in between them, and madly departs.

The PHOTOGRAPHER now shoots a pic of a thumbs-up PETER DAWSON
with his arms around an ALL OUT NERD.

VERONICA stands before the chaos, back to the viewer, in much
the same way Heather Chandler did in the opening scene.

PAULINE and the Geek Squad look to MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

          RODNEY
     I may be a geek, but I have my pride.

          PAULINE
     Gotcha...Could I get some Stoners
     over here please!

Frightened and flustered, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes
for a moment then crawls underneath her table.

A last panoramic view of the hustling CAMERA CREWS amid the
panderingly anarchic STUDENTS unfolds.

VERONICA suddenly finds herself flanked by J.D. The exiting
CAMERA CREWS flow past them.

          J.D.
     Was it as good for you as it was for me?

A dumbfounded VERONICA watches PAULINE and PETER approach.

          PETER
     I'm gonna need a VHS copy of all this by
     Monday for my Princeton application.

          PAULINE
          (looking to Veronica)
     Veronica, there you are! Wasn't it Fab?
     I've put peer pressure out to pasture!

          VERONICA
     Oh come on, Pauline. What happens
     tomorrow, when the cameras aren't here?

As they argue, J.D. looks out and sees MARTHA bob up from
beneath her table then dart back under. He ambles away....

          PAULINE
     Why are you dissing me, Veronica? I'm
     trying to redefine the high school
     experience.....

          VERONICA
     You're ignoring the high school
     experience. People are dead and all
     you can think to do is whip up some
     warped Pity Party. If we're going to
     ever build respect for each other,
     it's gotta be something...something
     real. We can't be tricked into it.
     Back me up J.D...J.D.?

          PAULINE
          (moving off)
     Let's go Peter, some people are just
     unwilling to share the pain....

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

MARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and
head down, tries to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks
up and freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her,
behind his Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly.

          J.D.
     Greetings and salutations.

INT. J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA restlessly rocks on a couch with increasingly
unguarded annoyance. Excitedly insensitive to her words, J.D.
spins the tuner of his radio, headphones pressed to one ear.

          VERONICA
     That thing this afternoon...I'm so
     angry! It was like "Boy, isn't death
     fun!" "Gee, I wonder who'll die next!"
     "I'll bet we get four camera crews
     next time." It was chaos. Fucking chaos.

J.D. giddily pivots around, tearing the headphones from the
radio and causing a blast of static to accompany his words.

          J.D.
     What are you talking about? Today
     was great. Chaos is great. Chaos is
     what killed the dinosaurs, darling,
     and it's what's going to make
     Westerburg a purified place to get
     an education. Face it, our way is
     the way. We scare people into not
     being assholes.

          VERONICA
          (a ticking time bomb)
     Our way is not our way.

          J.D.
     Tell that to the judge; "Your honor,
     I was led to believe there were Ich
     Luge bullets in the gun." Tell it to
     Kurt Kelly! "Don't shoot, Veronica,
     I'm the quarterback."

J.D. goes into a Sonny-Corleone-at-the-Turnpike imitation.
VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a
framed picture of a woman, at the vibrating J.D.

          VERONICA
     I'm telling it to you! You! Nothing
     good can come from suicide, from murder,
     from death. Nothing! Nothing except more
     death and shit like that feeding frenzy
     this afternoon....Geez, what am I..who...
     Unnaah! You can be so immature!

          J.D.
          (looking off)
     You kids are making too much damn noise.

BIG BUD DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway,
holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     We beat the bitches.

          VERONICA
          (mumbling)
     Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     Judge told em to slurp shit and die.

BIG BUD moves to the Entertainment console, turns off the
radio and turns on the V.C.R. He crams the cassette in and
hefts up his chest exerciser. He begins pumping away as the
image of a shabby building appears on the massive T.V.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.
     Masterful. When that blew, it set off
     a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.

The building blows up. BIG BUD cackles. J.D. politely
applauds. BUD pops out the videocassette and bounces away.

          BIG BUD DEAN
     It's great to be alive!

          VERONICA
     Do you like your father?

          J.D.
     Never given the matter much thought.
     Liked my mother.

J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw.

          J.D.
     They said her death was an accident.
     But she knew when the explosives were
     set to go off. She knew...

VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern.

          VERONICA
     In some sick way, we unclogged the
     sinuses of the school. But if we're
     going to keep the school healthy, it's
     gotta be through something having to
     do with life, not death.

          J.D.
     Whoa, Metaphor Tennis anyone? Tell me,
     if you put a Nazi in a concentration
     camp, does that make you a Nazi?

          VERONICA
     Maybe.

J.D. exhales in frustration before bounding up from the couch
to turn back on the radio.

          D.J. (Radio)
     Dudes, if I get one more request for
     that BigFun song I'm going to
     committ suicide. Here it is......

          J.D.
          (malevolently)
     They're playing our song....

As the "song" kicks in (a bunch of guys shouting over a drum
machine), J.D. seductively moves toward VERONICA, semi-lip-
syncing it. As a seethingly angry but not unaroused
VERONICA watches, J.D. slithers onto the couch.

          BIGFUN (Radio)
     TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW!
     PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW!
     BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO!
     TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
     TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

J.D. stops his seduction and rips out a gun. He giddily fires
into the radio, destroying it.

          VERONICA
     That's it, we're breaking up.

          J.D.
     Wha-a-at?

J.D. playfully tackles the fleeing VERONICA. This calms rather
than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.

          J.D.
     You can't bring them back. You
     must know that.

          VERONICA
     I'm not trying to "bring back"
     anybody...except maybe myself.

VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and
eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.

          VERONICA
     To think there was a time when I
     thought you were cool. If you can't
     deal with me now, just stay home and
     shoot your T.V., blow away a couple
     toasters or something. Just don't come
     to school and don't mess with me.

          J.D.
     You'll be back!

J.D. slowly sits up and with both hands, puts his gun in his
mouth. He pauses, lets go of the gun, and then biting down on
the barrel of the gun, J.D. proceeds to broodingly tie his
shoes.

INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk
as to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into
the second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it.
HEATHER DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8x10's.

The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp
uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end
of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses.
Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly
reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

          HEATHER DUKE
     What the.....

With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has
YOUNG HEATHER DUKE and YOUNG MARTHA eating toasted
marshmallows off each other's sticks.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (queasily intrigued)
     Where did you get these?

          J.D.
     Oh, I just had the nicest chat with
     Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's
     scary how everyone's got a story to
     tell....Would you care to see the
     canoeing shots?

          HEATHER DUKE
     What is this? Blackmail? So what. I
     once shared a bunk with the biggest
     loser in the state. I'm not running
     for president....
          (narrowing her eyes at the photos)
     I'll give you a week's lunch money.

          J.D.
     I don't want your money, I want your
     strength. Westerburg doesn't need
     mushy togetherness, it needs a leader.
     Heather Chandler was that leader but...

          HEATHER DUKE
     But she couldn't handle it.

J.D. laughs. She's on the ball.

          J.D.
     I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye
     Holden says his ideal job'd be making
     sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.
     He doesn't realize if you pay too much
     attention to the kids, you'll back off
     the cliff yourself.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Very very. The photographs?

          J.D.
     Don't worry. I'll ask you to do a favour,
     one you'll enjoy. You'll get the
     negatives and everything back then.

J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a
red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk.

          J.D.
     In the meantime, strength, And hey,
     there's a little gift.

INT. THE GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up
into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather
Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.

A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC
BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly
in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet hands
using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER DUKE
winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.

INT. HALLWAY--DAY

HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly
strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather
Chandler fashion to various passers-by.

ANOTHER HALLWAY--DAY

Disoriented, VERONICA somnambulates down the hall. She suddenly
brakes amid the flow of Student traffic to stare at a locker.
The locker wears a POLICE LINE--DO NOT CROSS sticker. VERONICA
pulls out a School Spirit Club I.D. Card and moves to the locker.

With the card, she wrangles the locker open. It contains a
coat, recognizably Heather Chandler's. On the inside door is a
sizable mirror, a cute little "HEATHER" license plate, an
Alexander Haig For President sticker, and a picture of VERONICA
and the HEATHERS all wearing sunglasses and acting tough.

VERONICA zeroes in on a three frame Photo Booth picture. In
the first frame, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER stare
stonefaced. In the second frame, the two girls are screaming
at the top of their lungs. In the third frame, they have
returned to a stonefaced state. VERONICA touches the picture
with a quivering smile as two hands flap around her eyes.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Guess who?

          VERONICA
     Heather.

VERONICA turns around, stunned. The Heather Chandleresque
HEATHER DUKE can be seen in the locker mirror. VERONICA
violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.

HEATHER DUKE peers in the open locker. A pair of red earrings
flash out at her. Biting her lip, she reaches for them.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With
a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...

          VERONICA
     Ouch. Your machine's got the most
     obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.

INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine.

          VERONICA (O.S./machine)
     I'm just calling to say you can
     wear your hair any way you want to.

A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID.

          DAVID
     Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on
     anybody's carpet lately?

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA cringes.

          VERONICA
     Is this David? Heather's David?
     What are you doing....

INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

          DAVID
     What can I say? I was pretty broken
     up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed
     somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

          VERONICA
     I'm delirious for the both of you.
     Can you put Heather on?

INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap.

          DAVID
     She can't really talk right now.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather
address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away,
VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night
table drawer and draws up another address book.
This one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and
dials.....

          VERONICA
     Hello, Betty.....

EXT. SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE AFTERNOON

BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in
delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.

          BETTY
     I don't believe it. I'm winning.

          VERONICA
     Don't get cocky, girl.

BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.

          BETTY
     I missed you. I know I'm not as, as
     exciting as your other friends.

          VERONICA
     That's bullshit. Just shoot.

BETTY once again bends and raises.

          BETTY
     Ronnie, I'm still a virgin. I french-
     kissed Al Springer once but he...

          VERONICA
          (warmly)
     Shoot.

BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.

          VERONICA
     Betty, your daydreams are a lot
     better than my realities, believe
     me. I'm afraid though it's time to die.

          BETTY
     Ronnie!

VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead
hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she
determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.

          BETTY
     Hey, you're not settling for the two shots
     are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.

          VERONICA
     It's not my style, okay?

          BETTY
     Nice guys finish last. I should know.

VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing
toward the porch and a statuesque Earring-wearing HEATHER
DUKE, who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Brav-o!

          BETTY FINN
          (nervously)
     I've got to get going, Veronica.

          VERONICA
     Sure.

HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and
fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Croquet won't be the same without Heather.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (condescendingly to the passing Betty)
     Oh Betty, leaving so soon...HEY, I'M RED!

LATER IN THE GAME

Red ball underfoot, HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER
MCNAMARA's green ball into the flower bed.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Shit.

          HEATHER DUKE
     You know what really bites; when people
     watch that cafeteria stuff on TV and see
     all those Geeks and Metalheads jumping
     around, they're going to think Uncool
     is the Rule at Westerburg.....Damn!

HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.

          VERONICA
     You're so polluted. Talking down to
     people, making fake notes....

VERONICA blows her shot.

          HEATHER DUKE
     I don't see what gives you the right
     to lecture, Ronnie. You were
     soulmates with Betty Finn until you
     realized you're the cover of
     Seventeen magazine and she's the
     before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.

HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares
to send it.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Some people just don't matter. Why
     should those who do carry their
     weight? Am I right?

As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her
own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two
balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.

          VERONICA
     No, you're wrong. It's not even
     your turn.

The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying
against a tree, pipes in.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     She's right.....Boy, croquet's not
     the same without Heather.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (shaking out her wrist)
     I don't know what your damage is
     Veronica, but me and Heather are
     going to walk over to the Mall.
     Maybe by the time we head back,
     your tampon'll be flushed.

As HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA meander out the back of
the yard, an annoyed VERONICA revolves back toward the house
to see J.D. sitting comfortably at the patio table with a
drink.

          VERONICA
     Christ, doesn't anybody knock?

          J.D.
     Mummy and Daddy let me in. So I'm a
     dark horse, huh? You make me blush...

VERONICA reaches the patio, gently swinging her croquet mallet,
excited with the thought that J.D. has come to change his ways.

          VERONICA
     Did you come to tell me something?
     Something nice. Remotely apologetic.

          J.D.
          (oblivious)
     How about that Heather Duke, huh? I
     say it's about time we got down to
     doing what we do best.

          VERONICA
          (angrily blowing up at her bangs)
     Just finish your drink and get out.

VERONICA storms to the patio door.

INT. GYM--DUSK

Wearing a BigFun T-shirt, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK sits in
the bleachers glumly sipping out of a cup of Coke. Cheers and
shouts can be heard booming around her.

As she places the cup down beside her, it is revealed MARTHA
is completely alone in the gym; the others being sad workings
of her embattled imagination.

She lifts the cup back up to her mouth but the plastic lid
pops off and a gush of Coke splashes onto her BigFun T-shirt.

INT. THE SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK

With her croquet mallet, VERONICA comes into her house,
sliding the patio door closed. MOM and DAD are watching a
video image of PAULINE FLEMING at a cafeteria table.

          MOM
     Jason's kinda cute for a dark horse.

          PAULINE (T.V.)
     The Westerburg Suicides were tough on
     all of us, but we shared the pain of
     losing three very popular souls.

          DAD
     I don't know about that coat he was
     wearing though. Hey, isn't that the
     flake we met at Open House.

A zombie VERONICA floats past her parents to stare at the T.V.

          PAULINE (T.V.)
     I came into the cafeteria and
     asked them to hold hands. The
     response was immediate.

Footage of the frenzied handholding Students unfolds upon the
screen with no evidence of the calculation behind it.
PAULINE's sanctimoniously dulcet tones go over the image.

          PAULINE (V.O./T.V.)
     My mere words liberated the students,
     causing them to open their petals and
     reveal their hopes and fears. By a
     stroke of luck, T.V. cameras were
     fortunate enough to happen to be on
     hand to capture this spontaneous,
     natural emotional outpouring of emotion.

          VERONICA
     Happened to be on hand....spontaneous
     natural emotional outpouring!

VERONICA clams up in anger as her parents babble.

          DAD
     Look there's Heather.

          MOM
     And there's Heather. Where are
     you, Veronica?

The video image of PAULINE at a cafeteria table returns.

          PAULINE (T.V.)
     Whether to commit suicide is the most
     important decision a teenager has to
     make. With supervision from people like
     myself, we can help young people make
     the right decision.

With her croquet, VERONICA slams the on/off Button and
turns to her parents.

          VERONICA
     I'm right here.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DUSK

MARTHA trudges outside of the school, the coke stain still
grotesquely encrusted to her BigFun T-shirt. She pins an
illegible-except-for-the-words-DEAR-WESTERBURG note onto her
shirt, over the stain. She continues moving toward a street
of passing cars.

INT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--DUSK/NIGHT

The Sawyer family is on fire. VERONICA yanks the television
cord from its socket.

          MOM
     Turn that back on!

          VERONICA
     Can't you see, these little programs
     eat up suicide with a spoon. They make
     it seem like a cool thing to do.

          DAD
     If we're not going to watch that
     program, can I put on the game?

          VERONICA
     Hey kids, make your parents and
     teachers feel like shit! Get the
     respect in death you'll never get
     in life!

          MOM
     Are you trying to tell me it is not
     a troubled time for the nation's youth?
     Get up off the floor, your dress is
     getting filthy.

          VERONICA
     Everybody cares about youth, not the
     individual. All we want is to be treated
     like human beings, not like guinea pigs
     to be experimented on and not like
     bunny rabbits to be patronized.

          DAD
     I do not patronize bunny rabbits.

          MOM
     Treated like human beings? Is that
     what you said little Miss Voice of
     a Generation? Just how do you think
     adults act with other adults? You
     think it's all just Doubles Tennis.
     Adults can be horrible to other adults.
     When teenagers complain that they
     want to be treated like human beings,
     it's usually because they are being
     treated like human beings.

VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.

          VERONICA
     I guess I picked the wrong time
     to be a human being.

MOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly gestures
to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile.

          MOM
     You'll live. Want some pate?

HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room, out of breath,
holding various shopping bags.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Hi everyone, door was open. Have you
     heard, Veronica? We were doing Chinese
     at the Food Fair, right, when they
     come over the radio and say Martha
     Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She
     bellyflopped in front of a car,
     wearing a suicide note.

          VERONICA
          (repulsed)
     Is she dead?

          HEATHER DUKE
     That's the punchline. She's still
     alive, in stable condition. Another
     case of a geek trying to imitate the
     popular people of the school and
     failing miserably. Is that pate?

VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

HEATHER DUKE paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw.
VERONICA is glumly sprawled on the ground.

          VERONICA
     I said I was sorry.

          HEATHER DUKE
     You are out of control. Heather and
     Kurt were a shock, but Martha
     Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed
     suicide hotlines in her diapers.

          VERONICA
     You're not funny. Turn on the radio.

          HEATHER DUKE
          (Heather Chandleresque)
     Martha couldn't take the heat so she
     got out of the kitchen. Just think
     what a better place the world would
     be if every nimrod followed her cue.

          VERONICA
     Just shut up and turn on the radio.
     Hot Probs is on.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Oh shit, yeah.

HEATHER DUKE hastens to the radio and flicks it on. Ripping
open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to
VERONICA as a TROUBLED MALE VOICE cuts the air.

          TROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio)
     I know it's supposed to be funny
     that they never get off the island,
     but still, sometimes I feel like I'm
     on that island and Gilligan can be just
     so stupid sometimes.

          HEATHER DUKE
     This sounds like a good one.

INT. RADIO STATION BOOTH--NIGHT

A slob D.J. cackles into a conference call-type box.

          D.J.
     Dude, you've got to remember if it
     wasn't for the courage of the fearless
     crew, the Minnow would be lost. The
     Minnow would be lost! Next call!

          TROUBLED MALE VOICE
     But Skipper hates me...

The D.J. rudely clicks off the TROUBLED MALE VOICE.

          D.J.
     Whoa, they're coming out early tonight.
     What ever happened to abortions and acne?
     You've got the Dogcatcher and you're
     listening to Hot Probs.

INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

HEATHER MCNAMARA is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom floor
talking on the phone and through her radio. A dim lamp
provides the room's only light.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather.

HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up at a Madonna poster on the wall.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that.

HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up to a knick-knack of little gold bird.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned
silence.

          D.J. (radio)
     Hey babe, I need a name?

INT. RADIO STATION BOOTH--NIGHT

          HEATHER MCNAMARA (box)
     My name is Tweety.

          D.J.
     Yo, Tweet, if you're going to tell
     me you just saw a puttycat....

INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

A broken-down HEATHER MCNAMARA sobs.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     God has cursed me, I think. The
     last time I had sex, the guy killed
     himself the next day. I'm failing Math.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

HEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on.

     HEATHER DUKE            HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio)
     Holy shit, that's       My whole life is a mess.
     Heather! We'll          I was supposed to be
     crucify her!            captain of the cheerleading
               team, but I probably won't
     VERONICA           because I miss practice when
     Oh man, she knows we         my Dad visits. My parents
     listen to this show!         are divorced and stuff and....

INT. CLASSROOM--DAY

A blackboard reads POOR LITTLE HEATHER.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Heather told everyone about Heather.

HEATHER MCNAMARA is revealed in the front row wearing her
cheerleader uniform. To the left, HEATHER DUKE dishes with
some dreamy GUYS. At the back of the classroom, VERONICA,
monocle in eye, writes in her diary.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather
     Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head
     has sprouted in its place like some
     mythological thing my eighth grade
     boyfriend would know about. Heather's
     even doing the old note trick.

A HOMELY GIRL is seen reading a note, glancing to a TYPICAL JOCK.
VERONICA takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom.

          VERONICA (V.O.)
     I've seen J.D.'s way. I've seen Pauline's way.
     Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's
     way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get
     him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom?
     Or to Hell? And where's Heather going?

HEATHER MCNAMARA suddenly rises and walks out of the classroom,
passing a GRUFF TEACHER in a trenchcoat, carrying a briefcase.

          GRUFF TEACHER
     Where's Heather going?

          HEATHER DUKE
     She's going to cry-y-y.

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

HEATHER MCNAMARA struggles to open a bottle of sleeping pills.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Fucking child protector caps.

INT. THE GRUFF TEACHER'S CLASSROOM--DAY

GRUFF TEACHER writes a math problem on the board. A flustered
VERONICA squirms in her seat then leaps up and runs to the door.

          GRUFF TEACHER
     Now where's she going? Is somebody getting
     raped today on All My Children or what?

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY


INT. HALLWAY--DAY

VERONICA races down the hall.

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

HEATHER MCNAMARA is a chipmunk with a mouthful of pills.

She pulls a glass from her purse and turns on a faucet, but no
water comes out. She manages to mumble.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Give me a break.

HEATHER MCNAMARA gets running water from another sink as
VERONICA rushes in. VERONICA punches HEATHER MCNAMARA's face
causing the pills to explode out of her mouth. HEATHER
MCNAMARA slumps against a stall, onto the floor.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     What are you trying to do? Kill me?

VERONICA jumps up and down on the pills on the floor.

          VERONICA
     What were you trying to do? Sleep?

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Suicide is a private thing.

VERONICA lunges forward to strike her. HEATHER MCNAMARA
recoils with a wail. Half-regaining her composure, VERONICA
slides down next to HEATHER MCNAMARA.

          VERONICA
     You're giving your life away to
     become a goddamn statistic in U.S.
     Fucking A Today. That's got to be
     the least private thing I can think of.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?

          VERONICA
     If everyone jumped off a bridge,
     young lady, would you?

HEATHER MCNAMARA wipes tears from her eyes and smiles weakly.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Probably....

          VERONICA
     Hey now, if you were happy every day
     of your life, you wouldn't be a human
     being, you'd be a game show host.

          HEATHER MCNAMARA
     Let's knock off early. Buy some shoes.
     Something lame like that.

          VERONICA
     Sure.

INT. THE EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

Comfortably slouched at a desk, J.D. laconically rumbles.

          J.D.
     So it's come to this.
          (turning to the viewer)
     Heather Chandler did polls. I want you
     to do a Petition, as a favor, as the
     favor. You've heard the group Big Fun, right?

HEATHER DUKE sits at the desk opposite him torching the
manilla envelopes (photographs) with a butane lighter.

          HEATHER DUKE
     TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

          J.D.
          (post-chortle)
     Some teenybopper rag said that Big Fun wants
     to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's
     if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

J.D. flips across a stack of blank, connected computer
printout sheets. At the top is a small paragraph and the word
PETITION. HEATHER DUKE blows ashes off her desk and grabs it,
giggling.

          HEATHER DUKE
     I'll get right on it coach. And hey,
     a little gift. I won't be needing it.

HEATHER DUKE twirls her copy of Catcher in the Rye to a
pleased J.D.

INT. STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

HEATHER DUKE gothically ascends a staircase, holding the
petition. She stops, arms raised high, to bathe in the
sunlight blasting through the staircase window.

INT. CAFETERIA--DAY

HEATHER DUKE, petition in hand, sashays toward the Country
Club Kids table.

          COURTNEY
     Oh great. Here comes Heather.

          KEITH
     Shit.

INT. SCHOOL BUS--DAY

HEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS.

EXT. SCHOOL LAWN--DAY

The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a patch of Jocks.

INT. STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of
the staircase window.

EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

Strategically wearing Heavy Metal accessories, HEATHER DUKE
slams down the petition atop a car-hoodful of Metalheads.

INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

Decked out in denim, HEATHER DUKE vanishes into the Stoner
Hallway smoke, with the petition.

INT. THE STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

HEATHER DUKE further writhes in the sunlight until VERONICA's
perplexed voice cuts into her bliss.

          VERONICA (O.S.)
     Heather?

HEATHER DUKE brings down her arms and the petition and turns
to VERONICA, revealed to be descending down the steps.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've
     gotten everyone to sign this petition
     even the one who think BigFun are
     tuneless Eurofags. People love me!
          (giggling)
     My God, you haven't signed!

          VERONICA
     People love you but I know you.
     Jennifer Forbes told me the petition
     she signed was to put a hot tub in
     the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

          HEATHER DUKE
          (verbally winking)
     So some people need different kinds
     of "convincing" than others....
          (happiness evaporating)
     Hey, just sign the petition!

          VERONICA


          HEATHER DUKE
     It was J.D.'s idea! He made
     out the signature sheet and
     everything. Now will you sign it?

          VERONICA
          (queasy)
     No.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Jealous much?

VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE with all her might.

          VERONICA
     Heather, why can't you just be a
     friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?

          HEATHER DUKE
     Because I can be! The same fucking cheek,
     goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick?
     Do you think, do you really think, if
     Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her
     Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with
     her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

HEATHER DUKE stumbles down the stairs.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Fuck me gently with a chainsaw...

J.D.'s voice cuts into VERONICA's concentration.

          J.D. (O.S.)
     Wanna go out tonight?

VERONICA grimly turns to see a smirking, descending J.D.

          J.D.
     Catch a movie? Some miniature Golf?

          VERONICA
          (jokingly but caustically)
     I was thinking more along the lines
     of slitting Heather Duke's wrists
     open and making it look like a suicide.

J.D. seductively slides behind VERONICA and envelops her.

          J.D.
     I could be up for that. I've already
     started underlining meaningful passages
     in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye,
     if you know what I mean. This is great,
     Veronica. I knew you'd come back.

As in the Chandler kitchen scene, J.D. kisses the back of
VERONICA's neck and she closes her eyes. Suddenly she rifles
her elbow into his stomach, doubling him over. She screams in
his ear then bolts down the stairs as he gasps after her.

          VERONICA
     It's over, J.D.  Over! Grow up!

          J.D.
     I don't get it! You were wrong! I was
     right! Strength, damnit! Come back!

INT. SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK

Intensely clutching her schoolbooks, VERONICA walks through
the front door into the living room where MOM and DAD sit with
aggressively compassionate faces. VERONICA is a bit confused.

          VERONICA
     Yes?

MOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks.

          MOM
     Your friend Jason Dean just stopped
     by. He seemed very concerned about
     you. He said he thinks you might
     try to kill yourself.

          DAD
     You have been depressed lately. Oh,
     he said this is for you.

DAD holds out an envelope. VERONICA nabs it and rips it open.
The note reads, in feminine manuscript: RECOGNIZE THE
HANDWRITING?

          VERONICA
     Oh my God....

VERONICA runs off, her mother's voice trailing behind her.

          MOM (O.S.)
     He says we should keep you away from
     sharp objects, closed garages, toxic...

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DUSK

VERONICA vaults through her bedroom door. A Barbieish doll
wearing a BigFun T-shirt hangs from a noose. With a whimper,
she swerves away from it, looks to her open window, and then
dives onto her bed.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOUSE--NIGHT

J.D. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs
suavely crossed. He looks uo to Veronica's bedroom window and
hears another whimper emerge. He puts a cigarette in his mouth
and lights it with a smile.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her
eyes.....tighter and tighter as J.D.'s voice.

          J.D. (O.S.)
     "You can't ever find a place nice
     and peaceful because there isn't any."

VERONICA flops around to see J.D. kneeling over her on her bed
reading Heather Duke's copy of The Catcher in the Rye.

          J.D.
     Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-
     I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-
     so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give
     it a try, underline something.

J.D. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone
position, tossing the book to an enraged VERONICA.

          VERONICA
     Get off my bed, you sick psycho.
     You think you're a rebel. You're
     not a rebel. You're a sick psycho.
          (increasing rage)
     Do you think you're a rebel? Do you
     think you're a rebel? I wanna know!

          J.D.
     You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's
     call the whole thing off...Hold it!

VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she
holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into
the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that
place and peers in.

          J.D.
     Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I
     love it. I usually go for whole
     sentences myself, but hey this is
     perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...

          VERONICA
     Wait a....You're not listening! I'm
     not on your side....

INT. THE DUKE KITCHEN--NIGHT

The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door. J.D. moves to the
dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe.

          VERONICA
     You're still not listening! I'm not..

          J.D.
          (pulling out the knife)
     Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.

          VERONICA
          (taking the knife from him)
     This knife is filthy.

          J.D.
     What in the hell do you think I'm
     doing? Taking out her tonsils?

          VERONICA
     I think I know Heather a bit better
     than you, okay? If she was going to
     slash her wrists, the knife would
     be absolutely spotless.

J.D. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.

          J.D.
     How's this? Can you see your
     fucking reflection?

She can and so can the viewer. Tears well in VERONICA's eyes.
She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.

          VERONICA
     Tomorrow someone else will move
     into her place. That person
     could be me.
          (suddenly deliriously defiant)
     Ha, there's only one of us who knows
     Heather's handwriting and if you think
     I'm doing another suicide note.

          J.D.
          (laughing)
     You don't get it, do you? Society
     nods its head at any horror the
     American teenager can think to
     bring upon itself. We don't need
     gloves and does anyone really
     care about exact handwriting?

J.D. tears his gloves off with a giggle. He takes a pen from the
kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. He shoves the
pen in VERONICA's hand and grabbing her hand, forces her to
scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper.

          J.D.
     Perfecto. Man, I've even got a
     marked-up Catcher in the Rye.
     What else does a suicide need?

J.D. pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a
door revealing HEATHER DUKE, asleep in an artful pose on a
couch, MTV images from the T.V. flashing against her.

          J.D.
          (raising the knife)
     If you'll excuse me......

          VERONICA
     No-o!

J.D. hos in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA
races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob
trying to open the locked door.

INT. AN ANOYNYMOUS T.V./HEATHER DUKE'S ROOM--NIGHT

The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild
African music thundering on the soundtrack as PAULINE FLEMING
ethereally moves to a blackboard with three chalk strokes on
it and makes a fourth chalk stroke.

INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

In speeded-up imagery, DENNIS, PETER, and the YEARBOOK GIRL
maneuver pictures of HEATHER CHANDLER, KURT, RAM, and HEATHER
DUKE in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate
them all on the same two page layout.

INT. FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY

With even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing "What
a Waste, Oh the Humanity" T-shirts toss out tons of black
armbands into a hungry crowd.

INT. CHURCH--DAY

The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a
halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin.
FATHER RIPPER wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee,
walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and
STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER RIPPER
dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking.

          FATHER RIPPER
     Eskimo.

FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up the
book.

          FATHER RIPPER
     Heather Duke underlined a lot of
     things in this copy of The Catcher
     in the Rye, but I believe the word
     Eskimo, underlined all by itself is
     the key to understanding Heather's pain.

VERONICA stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her
face.

          FATHER RIPPER
     On the surface, Heather Duke was the
     vivacious young lady we all knew her
     to be. But her soul was in Antartica,
     freezing with the knowledge of the way
     fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way
     parents can be unresponsive, and as she
     writes so eloquently in her suicide note,
     the way life can suck. We'll all miss
     Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope
     she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

HEATHER CHANDLER  moves next to VERONICA holding a plate of
steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and
something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Is this turnout weak or what? I had
     at least seventy more people at
     my funeral.

          VERONICA
     Heather? Wha...

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is
     s-o-o boring. If I have to sing
     "Kumbaya" one more time...

          VERONICA
     What are you doing here?!

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     I made your favorite. Spaghetti.
     Lots of oregano.

With a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into
the plate of spaghetti.

          HEATHER CHANDLER
     Dinner!

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep
in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her
mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all
been a dream...........

          MOM (O.S.)
     Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!

VERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly
launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her
monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.

          VERONICA (O.S.)
     Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not
     the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A.
     That is to say, no one but me. I know
     where J.D. is coming from and where
     he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going
     to teach him what's right. I'm going
     to stop J.D....If it's the last thing
     I do.

VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the
pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls
out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She
puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back
in the blazer.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT

J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with
his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began
dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He
checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads
toward the house.

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging doll.

EXT. THE SAWYER FRONT YARD--NIGHT

J.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house.

INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE--NIGHT

MOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on.

          MOM
     Does she want a written invitation?
          (yelling upward)
     Veronica! Dinner!

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

J.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the
rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.

INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE--NIGHT

MOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.

          MOM
     Honey?

INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in
one hand, the Barbieish doll in the other.

          J.D.
     I can't believe you did it. I was
     teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed
     up here to kill you, but first I was
     going to try and get you back. With
     amazing petition.

J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the
computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out
on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different sizes,
styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.

          J.D.
     It's a shame you can't see what our
     fellow students really signed.

J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath the
typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off, reavealing
another typed paragraph.

          J.D.
     Listen. "We students of Westerburg
     High will die. Today. Our burning
     bodies will be the ultimate protest
     to a society that degrades is. Fuck
     you all." Not that subtle but neither's
     blowing up the school. Talk about your
     suicide pacts. When our school explodes
     tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of
     thing that infects a generation. A
     Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we
     coulda toasted marshmallows together.

          MOM (O.S.)
     Honey, are you all right in there?

J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.
MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter, launches
into frantic screams.

          MOM
     Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my
     baby back! I should have let you keep
     that job at the mall. I was just afraid
     of you coming home alone at night!

VERONICA opens her eyes.

          MOM
     I made your favorite! Spaghetti!
     Lots of oregano!

VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains
hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath
her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-
knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow over
the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.

          VERONICA
     Hey Mom, why so tense?

INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE AREA--NIGHT

Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner plate
to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.

INT. J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

J.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D.
turns down his stereo (and the Montage music).

          BIG BUD DEAN (O.S.)
     I need some help with my homework...

          J.D.
     Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....

J.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music).

EXT. FRONT OF WESTERBURG HIGH--MORNING

The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front of
the school. STUDENTS pour out.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING

STUDENTS come out of their cars.

INT. HALLWAY--MORNING

Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-
locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her
locker.

A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing
VERONICA as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.

          PAULINE
     Veronica! J.D. told me you
     committed suicide last night!

          VERONICA
     Where is he? Where's J.D.?

          PAULINE
     We have to talk.  I've got some
     pamphlets in my office that will help
     you decide if suicide is really for
     you.  Come on, let's go take a look.

          VERONICA
     Get a job.

VERONICA storms to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker
combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and
freezes.

In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway
carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.

VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is
barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into
the Boys bathroom.

INT. BOYS BATHROOM--DAY

J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He
turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.

INT. THE HALLWAY--DAY

The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell
rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.

VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down
the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.

INT. THE GYM--DAY

A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily
doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up
beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.
PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone.

J.D., toting the gym bag, slips through the gym door. He moves
unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers.

INT. THE HALLWAY--DAY

VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.

INT. GYM--UNDER THE BLEACHERS--DAY

Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a
steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can be
discerned taped to other supports.

INT. THE EMPTY HALLWAY--DAY

VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to
keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from
classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of STUDENTS
move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her troubled
treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.  She latches
onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at his clutched
arm with a nervous smile.

          VERONICA
     Rodney, where's everybody going?

          RODNEY
     It's Friday.....

          VERONICA
     Oh my God, another damn pep assembly....

          RODNEY
     Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,
     but at least we all get out of class...

VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to
inquisitively move forward through the crowd.

INT. THE GYM--DAY

J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.
He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move
toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set
of stairs.

INT. THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM--DAY

VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS
heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates
file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread.
She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.

          VERONICA
     Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.
and says........

          RODNEY
     The boiler room.

VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a
couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the staircase
beside the gym.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing
the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy steel door.
Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly pick the
lock. He swings open the steel door.

          VERONICA (O.S.)
     May I see your hall pass?

J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,
pointing the bedroom gun at him.

          J.D.
     I knew that loose was too noose! I
     mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!

          VERONICA
     Like father, like son. A serious-as-
     fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll
     set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
     Okay, so let's start by slowly putting
     the bomb down on the ground.

J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He folds
his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.

          VERONICA
     Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.
     Put your hands on your head.

          J.D.
     You didn't say Simon Says.

J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her
over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully retrieves
it.

INT. THE GYM--DAY

The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the
bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making
swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.
Various Jocks, stand on the stage with PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a
YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.

INT. THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.
J.D. raises the gun to her head.

          J.D.
     Live by the sword...

VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand
upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow
annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of
composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder
right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the
boiler room, jarring the gun loose.

They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the
better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.
VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs
scissors-style around her and trips her.

INT. GYM--THE PREP ASSEMBLY--DAY

The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER MCNAMARA
rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around a pair of
opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. A
group of STONERS toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them
lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb.

INT. THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY--DAY

A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.

          J.D.
     You think just because you started
     this thing, you can end it?

J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA
sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then
savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm
and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.

          J.D.
     You, really didn't think I'd, forget,
     forget, to disconnect the....

VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D. grabs
her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.

A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds
toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel
steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently
kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins from
VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of the bag
onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on the bomb clicks
on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...

INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY
FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all
sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as
STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. Jocks stand on the
stage grinning and preening before the crowd.

INT. THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler
room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting position
and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock
clicking to 3:04. VERONICA crawls to the gun and levels it at a
rousing-up J.D.

          VERONICA
     The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do
     you turn it off? Tell me!

Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives
VERONICA "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...

          J.D.
     Fuck you!

Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger."
Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden
geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.
The bomb clicks down to 2:25.

          VERONICA
     It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.

          J.D.
     You want to wipe the slate clean as
     much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am
     killing everyone in the school
     because nobody loves me. You have a
     purpose though! Remember? Let's face
     it, the only place different social
     types can genuinely get along with
     each other is in heaven.

VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.
She focuses her eyes on three red buttons on the bomb.

          VERONICA
     Which button do I press to turn it
     off? Tell me!

          J.D.
     Try the red one, but seriously, people
     are going to look at the ashes of
     Westerburg and say there's a school
     that self-destructed not because
     society didn't care, but because
     that school was society. Is that
     deep or what? I'll let you put it in
     your diary, babe. Free of charge.

          VERONICA
     Which red button, asshole?

          J.D.
     Press the middle one to turn it off.
     If that's what you want babe.....

VERONICA picks up the bomb and puts it on a steel drum,
speaking with her back turned.

          VERONICA
     You know what I want, babe?

          J.D.
          (crouching)
     What?

J.D. snatches up his switchblade and lunges toward VERONICA.
She springs away, causing him to bring the knife down past her
and onto the middle red button, stopping the clock on the bomb
at 00:17.

          VERONICA
     Cool guys like you out of my life.

VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s stomach. Coughing and
moaning, he splatters against a generator.

          VERONICA
     But don't worry, these here
     were Ich Luge bullets.

J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA wearily
regards the image of the knife stuck in the stopped bomb.

INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music
plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion
as well. At normal speed, a smiling VERONICA walks to the doors
of the gym and peers in.

The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and prancing
cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion. VERONICA walks
away......

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside
of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in
the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face. A
strange voice kills it.

          J.D. (O.S.)
     Color me impressed.

J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting
from his mouth onto his gunslinger coat.

          J.D.
     You really fucked me up, Veronica.

          VERONICA
     I thought I...you..I...

          J.D.
     You've got power, Veronica. Power I
     didn't think you had. The slate is clean.

J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
his torso. The green light is on and the clock says
00:10..00:09.

          J.D.
     Pretend I did blow up the school. All
     the schools. Now that you're dead,
     what are you gonna do with your life?

VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
puts it in her mouth. She then folds her arms.

          VERONICA
     Perfecto.

J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his
crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.

INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-down
pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the bleachers
screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense of excitement.

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and
her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in
bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
to go inside.

INT. THE FRONT HALLWAY--DAY

VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling
students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the
thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.

          HEATHER DUKE
     Veronica, you look like hell.

          VERONICA
     Yeah, I just got back.

VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER DUKE
by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.

          HEATHER DUKE
     What are you doing?

          VERONICA
     Heather, my love, there's a
     new sheriff in town.

VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it around
the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on the cheek,
leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.

          VERONICA
     Hey, Martha, wait up.

MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in a wheelchair,
brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused. VERONICA
walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair and
accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.

          VERONICA
     My date for the prom kind of flaked
     out on me, so I thought if you
     weren't doing anything that night
     we could go to the video store and
     rent some new releases or something.
     Maybe pop some popcorn.

          MARTHA
     I'd like that.

          VERONICA
     So would I.

VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding Bogart/Rains style.
