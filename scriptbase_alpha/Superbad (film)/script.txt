    OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC,
    which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the
    expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence.

    Instead we get:

    INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING

    Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
    attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
    cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
    his cell and dials.

                           SETH
              Yo.

    INTERCUT WITH:

    INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

    Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
    clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
    off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.

                           EVAN
              What's up?

                        SETH
              I was doing research last night, for next
              year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang
              Bus.

                        EVAN
              Which one's Bang Bus?

                        SETH
              The one where they bang the chicks on the
              bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
              access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
              It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging
              them myself.

                        EVAN
              That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking
              it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
              at the bill.

                         SETH
              It shows up under a different name.
                  (beat)
              I hope. Bang Bus.

                 That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should
                 just pick the one with the least dirty
                 sounding name.

                           EVAN
                 Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.

    Seth pulls up in front of a house.

                           SETH
                 I could tell my parents I'm doing a
                 project on Rome and I have to research
                 orgies.

    Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
    towards Seth's car.

                           EVAN
                     (still into phone)
                 Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
                 on blow jobs.

    They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to
    pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 Thanks for taking him, Seth.

    Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.

                           SETH
                 Don't touch that!

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 You two are so funny. I can't imagine
                 what you'll do without each other next
                 year. Evan told me you didn't get into
                 State.

                           SETH
                 Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
                 Good places. I think we'll be fine.

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 Are you going to miss each other?



                           EVAN
                 Miss each other? No!



                                                            (CONTINUED)
                                                                     3.

                           SETH
                 That's disgusting.

                              MOM
                 Bye, boys.

    Seth and Evan drive off.

                           SETH
                 I am truly, truly jealous that you got to
                 suck on those tits when you were a baby.

                           EVAN
                 Fuck you, man.

    EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER

    They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
    reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth
    turns into the STAFF parking lot.

    INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER
5                                                                         5

    Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.

                           EVAN
                 You're being an idiot, man. You really
                 shouldn't park there.

                           SETH
                 Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
                 They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
                 least they can do for stealing three
                 years of my life.

    They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
    enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
    Seth.

                           EVAN
                 What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?

                           SETH
                 Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
                 knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in
                 capture the flag last week.

                           EVAN
                 Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
                 in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate
                 that guy.

    They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

                           EVAN (CONT'D)
                 Look at those nipples.

                           SETH
                 They're like baby toes.

                           EVAN
                 It's not fair. I have to hide every
                 erection I get.

                           SETH
                 Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
                 hide them. And then I get nervous and my
                 heart starts pounding, and it all just,
                 like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
                 this...thing...that's attached to me. And
                 it won't go away.

                           EVAN
                 Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
                 by our boners and they actually wanted to
                 see `em, like this shit.

                           SETH
                 You know it's been, like, a year and a
                 half since I've seen an actual human
                 female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
                 last month, and it was sick.

                           EVAN
                 Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
                 guess so. She was insanely hot, though.

                           SETH
                 Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.

                           EVAN
                 How can that possibly suck? I'd be
                 fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
                 that hot. You got, like, two dozen
                 handjobs!

                           SETH
                 And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
                 was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
                 gettin' career, and it happened way, way,
                 way too early.

                           EVAN
                 You're like Orson Welles.

                        SETH
              Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
              probably at least be having steady sex
              with a mediocre-looking girl at this
              point. I honestly now see why Orson
              Welles ate his fat ass to death.

                        EVAN
              You'll have sex in college. Everyone
              does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
              Bus.

                        SETH
              But the key is to be good at sex by the
              time you're in college. You don't want
              girls to think you suck dick at fucking.

                        EVAN
              I still think you've got a chance with
              Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
              and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
              she still flirts with you.

                        SETH
              Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
              dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
              and what's-his-face. All of those were
              cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
              you think. Why would she end her high
              school career with me?

                        EVAN
              Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.

                        SETH
              Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
              loser. You're a step up from that. Which
              is why you should stop being a pussy and
              do her! You could nailthe shit out of
              her for, like, two months before you
              leave. That bitch looks like a good
              fucker.

                        EVAN
              Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
              like that, man!

    Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.

                        SETH
              What, you can talk about that bitch all
              day every single day, but I can't say one
              thing about her?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

              I don't constantly insult her.

                        SETH
              I didn't insult her! I said she looks
              like a good fucker! She looks like she
              can take a dick. That's a good thing.
              Some women pride themselves on their dick-
              taking abilities.

    Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the
    rough-looking smokers, calls out.

                        TERRY
              Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big
              grad party?

    Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.

                        SETH
              No.

                        TERRY
              Yeah.

    Terry spits on Seth's shirt.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
              And you're not coming. Tell your fucking
              faggot friend he can't come either.

    Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
    though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when
    Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry
    and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head
    back to school.

                        EVAN
              Wow. You really bitched out on that one.

                         SETH
              I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
              across the street before I even realized
              what was going on.

    BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS

    There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the
    school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys
    start running.

    We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the
    same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The
    group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the
    frame. He stops.

    CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:

    Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.

    Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.
    She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
    volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
    her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
    immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.

    The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as
    they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a
    pen.

                           HELEN
                 Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.

                 Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep
                 it. Then you'll just have it, and you
                 won't have to borrow another pen.

                           HELEN
                 Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did
                 you hear about Terry's grad party? It's
                 going to be so insane.

                 going to be going on that night...so, you

                 Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at
                 any parties or anything.

                           EVAN
                 Because of all the other fun shit I'm off
                 doing.

                           HELEN
                     (playful)
                 Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's
                 party on Saturday?

                           EVAN
                 Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go,
                 because, well, I did other stuff.
                 Saturday...
                     (nervous, he desperately
                      thinks)
                 Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!

                 First my parents went out to a double
                 feature, so a bunch of people came
                 over...

    Seth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web
    site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one
    of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old.

                           EVAN
                 ...and we had a couple drinks in my
                 basement...

    An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer
    cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer.

                           EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)
                 ...and Seth's parents were having this

     Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys
     are drunk as hell.

                         EVAN
               ...and there were actually some really
               interesting and, like, entertaining
               people there...

     The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce
     onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several
     adults look at them like they are morons.

                         EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.)
               ...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live

     In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives
     Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh.

                         EVAN
               ...then we went to a club downtown...

     The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.

                         EVAN
               ...and then we pretty much called it a

     Evan pukes all over Seth. Evan and Fogell laugh hysterically
     as Seth yells at them.

     We return to Evan talking to Helen in the halls.

                         EVAN
               ...you would've loved it.

                         HELEN
               That sounds so fun. I would love to go do
               something like that.

     Helen is disappointed in his response.

                             HELEN
                  So, are you guys going to the same school
                  next year?

                  Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got
                  into different ones.

                            HELEN
                  What are you going to do without him?

                            EVAN
                  Same shit I've always been doing. It'll
                  be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.

     Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard
     reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.

     Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.

                            SETH
                  Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
                  thought I'd be cooking with a partner.
                  It's not fair. She's never here. I don't
                  get twice the marks for doing all the
                  work.

                            MRS. GREIR
                  I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

                            SETH
                  Look at Evan.

     Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They
     both laugh hard.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  While I'm over in my unit, isolated and
                  alone, eating my terrible-tasting food
                  because I can't even properly mix
                  ingredients by myself, I gotta look over
                  at that.

     The Japanese boy ties Evan's apron. Evan then turns around
     and ties the boy's apron. They both look happy.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like
                  a single mother.

                            MRS. GREIR
                  Well, save it for next week. Today Jules'
                  partner isn't here either. Pair up with
                  her. Station four.

                            SETH
                  Jules?

     The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four,
     nervous as hell.

     ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking.       She
     stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.

     Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,
     unsure of what to say.

                            JULES
                  Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?

                            SETH
                  That's kind of a personal question.

                            JULES
                  What?

                            SETH
                      (nervous)
                  Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.

                            JULES
                  Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd
                  be forced to work with me. There's my
                  attempt at humour.

                            SETH
                  Well, I would call that a success.
                      (reading recipe sheet)
                  Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that
                  some kind of new cheese or something?

                            JULES
                  All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.

                            SETH
                  Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.

               Thank you! Yes! My older brother always
               eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is
               actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's
               moldy, then they tell you to eat it
               anyway.

               My parents are out of town and I'm
               thinking of having a party. I don't know
               how big it'll be, but you should come
               anyways.

                         SETH
               Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love
               parties.

                         JULES
               Really? I don't usually see you at them.

                         SETH
               Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate
               thing. Right now I love them, though.
               Uh...how do I do this?

                         JULES
               I'll write down my address and number.

     ANGLE ON: Evan.

     Evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray. Behind him, at
     the table, is the small Japanese boy eating the tiramisu.

                         EVAN
               That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?

     Seth walks up to Evan.

     you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants.
     She turns and notices Fogell. He gives an awkward look.

               like, I don't really know.

               I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.

                         JULES
               Okay. I'll see you tonight.

                         SETH
               Yeah! I'll see you!

     The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly
     runs down the hall.

     Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as
     they play soccer.

                         GYM TEACHER
               Evan, get into the game.

     Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his
     attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him.

                   (out of breath, worked up)
               Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know
               Jules? You know what she just did? She
               came up to me and asked me if I would buy
               her alcohol. Not just her, her whole
               party. Do you know what that means? It
               means that by some miracle, we were
               paired up, we talked, and she actually
               thought of me afterwards. Thought of me
               enough to decide that I was the guy that
               she was going to trust the fun-ness of
               her party with. She wants me! She fucking
               wants my dick!

                  me straight in the face and asked me. She
                  wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand

                  a little, so I can get with her. Then, I
                  make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck
                  her all summer long! Then, by the time
                  college rolls around, I'm the fuckin'

     The soccer ball rolls towards them. They both watch as it

     Helen, as usual.

                  You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her
                  alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are
                  both drunk, get with her! This is the
                  last party we're ever going to go to as
                  high school people! I've fully ignored my
                  hatred for Helen in coming up with this,
                  which is a big ass deal. We need to stop
                  being pussy and for once just goes balls
                  out, man!

     Evan seems to be swayed.

                  I should get Helen alcohol?

               No, no, I am. That's why I came looking
               for you. Me and some guys are going to
               the liquor store after class, so I was
               thinking I could buy you yours, if you
               needed someone to.

                         HELEN
               Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me
               such a hassle, cause I was going to beg
               my sister, but yeah, could you get me,
               like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay
               you back tonight.

               You will absolutely not. It's my treat.

                         SETH
               Holy shit! I don't believe this. This
               says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you
               just put 21?

                          FOGELL
               I knew you would ask that. Look, every
               day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor
               store with fake ID's trying to act like
               Joe Casual. Each and every one of these
               kids just so happens to be 21 years old.
               Just how many 21 year-olds do you think
               there are?

                           SETH
               Fool!

                         EVAN
               Calm down! It's not terrible! This might
               work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll
               either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid
               with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin,
               the twenty five year-old organ donor".
               What's it gonna be?

     Fogell takes a deep breath.

               You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and
               this is never going to work. We need a
               new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to
               Canada or something?

               I still think it's going to work.

     They walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops.

               Why would you park in the staff-

                         SETH
               Shut up, Fogell.

                         FOGELL
               `Cause you're not staff.

                         SETH
               I am aware of that, Fagell.

     Seth puts on a shirt that is way too small and he's wearing

     Evan and Seth, carrying an empty two liter bottle of Coke,
     cautiously descend the creaking staircase. Their eyes watch
     the TV room, where Evan's mom is on the phone. The boys enter
     the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet. Seth
     enthusiastically reaches for a bottle.

     Evan begins unscrewing his bottle, when he notices a little
     black line marking where the liquor bottle is filled to.
     Then, he realizes that every bottle has it.

     Evan hurries off. Seth looks at the liquor cabinet, trying to
     choose the best booze. He grabs a massive bottle of gin. Evan
     reappears.

     Evan reluctantly holds an empty Coke bottle as Seth shakily
     pours the gin in. Evan starts refilling the gin bottle with
     water, when suddenly they both hear his mom coming.

     Seth runs off with the gin and Coke bottle. Evan quickly
     closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom
     enters. Through the window she see's that Seth is already on
     the front lawn and thinks nothing of it.

     long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD
     WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers.

     Seth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze
     in the conveyor belt.

                  You certainly are. That'll be eighty
                  dollars.

     Seth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.

                            SETH
                  Thank you kindly.

     Seth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his
     head. He eyeballs the old lady.

     The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand
     reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth.

                            SETH
                  Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse.
                  Would you like me to help you to your
                  car?

                            OLD LADY
                  That would be lovely, young man. Would
                  you like me to buy you alcohol?

     Seth, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady
     as she drives away.

     Seth shakes his head. He looks down the aisle again, takes a
     breath and starts walking.

     He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks
     down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads,
     "GOLDSCHLAGER."

                            SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)
                  Don't do it kid.

     We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth
     doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.

                            SETH
                  I never had a choice.

     He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it
     with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at
     Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY
     in the head.

                            OLD LADY
                      (in agony)
                  AAAHHHHH!!!

     Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce
     bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken
     end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out.
     Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.

     At first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused,
     dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and
     takes a few deep breaths.

     Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps
     walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell
     passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly

     He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at
     the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly
     opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack
     and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the
     other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
     spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop
     the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is
     impossible.

     currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.

                         CASHIER
               Um, yes, may I please see some ID?

                         OLD-LOOKING GUY
               No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in
               years.

                         CASHIER
               Anyone who looks under thirty-five.

     The guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches.

     Seth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows.

               It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never
               had a problem. It's fine. Right?

               Did you remember a condom?

                         SETH
               You brought a condom?

                         EVAN
               Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well.
               I brought one of those little things of
               spermicidal lube too.

     He takes them out of his pocket.

                         SETH
               You asshole! You laughed in my face when
               I said we'd be having sex tonight.

                  It doesn't mean you shouldn't be
                  prepared. You didn't even bring one?

                            SETH
                  No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan!
                  I can't believe you did that without even
                  consulting me about it!

                            EVAN
                  I don't really even understand what your
                  plan is.

                            SETH
                  I'm gonna go down on her for, like,
                  hours. She'll love that. She'll want to
                  go out with that.

                            EVAN
                  Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in
                  bringing just one little condom.

                            SETH
                  And one little bottle of spermicidal
                  lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know
                  you brought that! These girls are 18, not
                  dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.

                            EVAN
                  Fine. I won't bring the lube.

     Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him

                  Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it
                  for years. I heard they recently decided
                  to start adding more hops.

     Fogell just nods kind of proud of himself. She stops ringing
     stuff up and looks at him.

                  She had the biggest tits in the universe.

     Down the block there is a girl walking a dog.

                  I heard she had breast-reduction surgery.
                  Her tits must be crazy perfect now.

                  I gotta see these bastards. Let's check

     change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Fogell
     right in the side of the head!!! Fogell falls to the ground.
     The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a
     handful of money and runs!

     The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Fogell is on

                  But she fully looked way better before. I
                  thought when they reduced them, they just
                  kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them
                  more supple.

                            EVAN
                  I can't even begin to imagine the

     The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and
     OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the
     Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.

                      (to cashier)
                  So, did he punch anyone else?

                  I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I
                  have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand
                  that? A goddamn exam!

     The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of
     the store. The officers look at each other.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Apparently, she has an exam.

     They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell.

                  So then, son, you're the one that got
                  punched?

     Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then
     back at the cops. He nods.

                  We'd like to ask you a couple questions.

     The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil.

     In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we
     see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey
     jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is
     lying, apologizing frantically.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  A lot of people have strange names these
                  days.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I once arrested a man-lady who was
                  legally named "Pearl Necklace."

                            FOGELL
                  It's just... I changed my name. I was
                  going to be a singer. R&B.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Fine. That's not illegal.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  And, how old are you McLovin?

     Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again.

                            FOGELL
                  Old enough.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Old enough for what?

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Can I see your ID?

                            FOGELL
                  Um...okay...

     Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his
     pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to
     Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads
     of sweat are running down Fogell's face.

     In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's
     car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  You're an organ donor?

                            FOGELL
                  What?

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I didn't want to be one but my wife
                  insisted.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Just like a woman. Even after you're
                  dead, they want to tear your heart out.

     The officers start laughing. Fogell is shocked. They hand
     back the ID.

               Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't
               really have any information. I didn't
               really see him. His fist hit here.

     Fogell points at his giant black eye.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Are you in a hurry or something?

                         FOGELL
               Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a
               bus.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Where were you going?

                         FOGELL
               Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               We'll take you there, get your
               information on the way. Sit tight.

     Fogell is completely dumbfounded.

     The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan.

                         DRIVER
               I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't

               okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I
               do? Are you okay?

     The driver glances at the cop car.

                         DRIVER (CONT'D)
               I mean, please don't report me, we can

                  Fine. Just take it.

     The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money.
     Seth looks at it. It's seven dollars.

                            SETH
                  What is this? This isn't enough.

     Seth stuffs the money in his pocket.

                  It's all I have.

                  Well, you just came from the liquor
                  store, give us your liquor.

                             DRIVER
                  I didn't get any. They're not letting
                  anyone in. They're arresting someone or
                  something.

                            SETH
                  Well, they'll be arresting somebody else
                  if you don't do something quick. Ow! My
                  shoulder! It's killing me.

     Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is.

                            DRIVER
                  No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol?   I can
                  get you alcohol. I'm on my way to   this
                  party right now. There's gonna be   tons of
                  liquor. I will definitely get you   plenty.

               I don't....I don't like this idea at all.
               I'm just not feeling it. That guy's
               fucking creepy. Just look at him.

     They look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb
     expression on his face.

                         DRIVER
                   (to Evan)
               You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?

               He's an idiot. And he's our only hope.

     The Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the
     back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell

               Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying,

               Did you hear her say she has an exam

                         OFFICER MICHEALS
               Could we have taken her in? Just to scare
               the shit out of her?

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Hah. Probably could have found a way. But
               a good general rule is only take people
               in you want to ride with. And whiny
               bitches don't make that cut.

     The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car.

                  Yeah. It looks like it could actually be

                  people might show up. I hope they don't

                  She called, man! That's insane! She's

     They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been
     looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer,
     coolers, wine, vodka, everything.

                  Get the fuck out of my house.

                  Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a
                  dick.

     Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and
     drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the
     door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan.

     The Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front
     lawn. Seth and Evan watch from the doorway of the house, a
     group of people in front of them.

     Mark steps on the Driver's hand.

                            DRIVER (CONT'D)
                  Ahhhh! Fuck!

     The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot. He
     stands up.

                            DRIVER (CONT'D)
                  Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!

     Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward
     and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts!

     The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.

                            MARK
                  Francis, you and your idiot friends stay

     The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide
     in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.

                  You want to end up like that guy? Not me,

                  she'll get with me; not after I get her

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  We get the gist of it. You were buying
                  some beer, some guys came in and robbed
                  the place. I don't think we're gonna find

                  Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could
                  never catch one guy.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  You see, McLovin, if it was two guys,
                  we'd have twice the chance of catching
                  one of them. But just one guy? I mean,
                  how are we supposed to find one guy in
                  this whole city?

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people

                  Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or

                  Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone
                  walks up to me on the street, and is
                  like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell

                  Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then

     Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices
     all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then
     locates a cooler full of it across the dance area.

     He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot,
     sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him
     and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn't know how to
     react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the

     An R&B slow jam plays as an exuberant Seth, a Mike's Hard
     Lemonade in one hand and the Woman's ass in the other as the
     dancing becomes increasingly sexual. As the song ends, the
     Woman moves on.

     Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard. He
     grabs it and puts it in his pocket. The bulge is apparent.

     Extremely pleased with himself,

     Seth walks into the adjacent room. There are a bunch of GUYS
     chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he
     enters.

                         SETH
               Hey, wut up?

     The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him
     strangely.

                         GUY 1
               What is that? Is that red wine?

     Thinking he's busted, Seth quickly covers the bulge in his
     pocket.

                            SETH
                  Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're
                  talking about.

                            GUY 1
                  That shit you spilled all over yourself,
                  idiot.

                            SETH
                      (sincere)
                  I didn't spill anything on myself.

     Seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to.

                              SETH (CONT'D)
                  Oh shit.

     On Seth's upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size
     of a palm of a hand.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  What the hell is this?

                            GUY 1
                  Oh my lord. You were just dancing in
                  there, right?

                              SETH
                  Yeah, so?

     The guys all burst out laughing.

                            GUY 1
                  It's fucking blood.

                            SETH
                  Why would I get blood on my leg from---
                      (beat of realization)
                  OH SHIT!

     The guys start laughing even harder.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  Some girl perioded on my fucking leg!

                            GUY 2
                  I've never seen that before in my life.

     Seth pokes at the splotch.

               That is disgusting.

     Guy 1 gets up as Seth tries to cover up the mess with his
     shirt.

                         GUY 1
               I gotta show this to Bill.

                         SETH
               Who's Bill? Don't show Bill! No! I can't
               believe this is happening!

               We should find who did it.

                         SETH
               This is un-fucking-believable. I have to
               look good tonight!

     Guy 1 brings six more guys, including the Enormous Guy, into
     the room. He points out the stain Seth's pants. All the guys
     burst out laughing. Embarrassed and fearful of the attention,
     Seth starts making his way out of the room.

                         SETH
               Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up,
               assholes.

     Seth works his way through another room full of people,
     shielding the splotch as best as he can.

                         PARTY DUDE
               Dude! Check it out! That guy's having his

     Another group of people turn and laugh.

     The cops, Fogell, and the unconscious Homeless Guy each sit
     at the bar with a Corona in front of them. Slater's radio

                  So anyways, we leave the bar, I'm
                  charmin' her pants off telling her
                  stories of shoot-outs and shit.

                            FOGELL

                  McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless
                  people on the head. You're practically a
                  cop now.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  So I pull up in front of her house and
                  she asks me to come inside for some
                  coffee. Of course, I say yes.

                  Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I
                  start taking off my clothes, she fucking
                  flips, starts screaming at me, and I'm
                  like "Can't have coffee without cream."
                  Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then,
                  she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling
                  you McLovin, stay out of bars.

                            FOGELL
                  Hey, you don't need to tell me.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  So, yeah, you gotta look in different
                  places. The gym, an art class, you know,
                  shit like that.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you
                  believe that? I shot her in the neck, and
                  we just hit it off. And my first wife --
                  who is a whore -- where do you think we
                  met? A bar.

                            FOGELL
                  I don't know. I find they're always good
                  for a little quick ass.

     The cops laugh.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do
                  the whole mysterious guy thing, right?

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Yeah McLovin, how's it going with the
                  ladies?

     Fogell thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable.

                            FOGELL
                  Well, officers, it's not the going with
                  the ladies I care about, it's the coming.

     The cops and Fogell burst out laughing.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Oh! McLovin in the house!

     He sees that the cops clearly like him; his confidence level
     increased, he takes a chance.

               Yeah. We got guns.

               I haven't had one for long, but, man, let
               me tell you - it's like having two dicks.

     Fogell takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in

               Wow. I've never held one. Are they hard

     Seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it's not
     doing much. He stops for a moment to take a breather as he
     looks around the basement.

     He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he
     opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf
     is completely filled with beer.

                               HELEN
                  Okay. Bye.

     Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he
     turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES
     wander into the room.

                            DUDE 1
                  They're going to kill that guy, man. That
                  bitch's boyfriend is so pissed.

                            DUDE 2
                  Yeah. And he's a beast.

     They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of
     them notices Evan standing in the corner.

                            DUDE 3
                  Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid
                  with the splotch on his crotch?

     Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and
     horrified.

                            EVAN
                  No. What splotch-

                            DUDE 2
                  I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was
                  at that party with me.

                              DUDE 4
                  Who's he?

                            DUDE 2
                  He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the
                  crazy raps, the one I told you about!

     They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the
     door.

                            EVAN
                  Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy,
                  man. Sorry.

     Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door.

                            DUDE 3
                  No. No, that's you, man. You are fully
                  Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed
                  up you can't remember.

                            EVAN
                  Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't
                  even listen to rap.

                            DUDE 3
                  It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've
                  been telling these guys about you. Just
                  give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.

     They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid.

     Seth is finishing pouring the beer bottles into the second
     detergent jug. There are about thirty empty beer bottles
     laying around Seth. He tightens the cap, picks up the two
     detergent jugs, and heads upstairs.

     Seth emerges from the basement and heads towards the front
     door.

                            SETH
                  I did it man. Peace out-tro.

     He's inches away from the front door, when suddenly-

                            GUY 1
                  There! That's the guy!

     Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver,
     walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his
     leg, too.

                            SETH
                  Hey! You got one, too! We're blood
                  brothers.

                            MARK
                  Shut it, you little shitter! What the
                  hell were you doing dancing with
                  Jacinda?

     Horrified, Seth scrambles for excuses.

                            SETH
                  I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even
                  dance! Never even tried it!

                            MARK
                      (point at Seth's splotch)
                  Then where did that come from, asshole?

                            SETH
                  I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up
                  against each other at some point. How am

     The coked-up dudes are watching Evan intensely. They are
     completely loving his rapping, completely into it. Evan is
     struggling.

                  Dudes! Looks like a fight!

     Dude 3 does a line of coke and they all get up together and
     charge out of the room.

     There is a crowd gathered around Seth and Mark. The Enormous
     Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark.

                            SETH
                  I swear to God it wasn't me!

     Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the
     room. Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much
     commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands.

                            MARK
                  And what the fuck is this?

                            SETH
                  It's nothing. It's detergent.

                            MARK
                  Yeah. And what are you doing with it?

                            SETH
                  I...uh, I got blood on my pants.

     Mark sees the bottle of MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE in Seth's pocket
     and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a
     look of death.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  I brought them from home.

     Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES Seth and throws the beer
     bottle at his face!!! Seth holds up a detergent jug and
     deflects the beer bottle.

     It flies towards Evan, who ducks, and nails Dude 1 in the
     head, glass exploding everywhere!!!

                            DUDE 1
                  AAAHHHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!

     Dude 1 clutches his bloody head as the other Dudes charge at
     Mark! A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting!
     Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him
     into Evan.

                              DUDE 3
                  Hold him!

                            DUDE 2
                  HOLD HIM!!!

     Evan reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes
     pound on him.

     ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner

     Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly
     Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and
     faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA.

                            JACINDA
                  You motherfucker!

     She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth.
     She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!

                              SETH
                  AHH!!!

                  You're the one who used my leg as a
                  tampon!

     She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around
     the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles.

     Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan
     backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party.
                                                                  71.

     As Seth and Evan run up the block together, Jacinda talks

     The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is
     sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is
     carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               You've been saying some bold words, my
               friend. Better not mess up.

                         FOGELL
               You can do it, officer.

     BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole
     right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my
               nuts. Long, but gentle.

                         FOGELL
               Yeah! And eat his ass!

     They all laugh hysterically.

                         FOGELL (CONT'D)
               Can I shoot one?

     The cops look at each other and shrug.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.

     Slater hands Fogell the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be
     heard in the distance getting closer.

     Slater grabs the gun out of the disappointed Fogell's hand
     and holsters it. They all hop into the car.

     Michaels kicks it into drive and they peel out. Fogell shoves

     Suddenly, the car radio goes off.

                            EVAN
                  Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes
                  out!

                            SETH
                  We were supposed to go to college
                  together! Since elementary school! What
                  ever happened to that!

                            EVAN
                  What happened to that, is that you're too
                  stupid to get into the schools I did!

                            SETH
                  I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!

                            EVAN
                  You've wasted all my time, you selfish
                  bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and
                  making friends, I threw away the last
                  three years talking bullshit with you!
                  And now, because of you, I'm going to
                  college a fucking friendless virgin!

     Seth can't believe it. He's extremely hurt.

     shoves him back.

     Michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with
     his fist.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               How do they expect us to work these
               things while we're driving? I can't even
               work my iMac while I'm sitting at my
               desk.

                         FOGELL
               So, like, what does that computer do?

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Pretty much anything, if you're smart
               enough to figure it out. Like, who do you
               really hate? Gimme a name.

               Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham.
               Susette Graham.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Can I do it?

     Slater nods. Michaels bring her file up, then punches a few
     buttons and smiles.

                         FOGELL
               What did you do?

                   We got flashlights.

      Slater gets his flashlight and points it out the window.

      Seth swings at Evan with the giant detergent jug. Evan dodges
      it and shoves Seth hard. Seth stumbles onto the road and gets
      HIT by the COP CAR!!! Seth flies up onto the hood, SMASHING
      the windshield. The car screeches to a halt and Seth slides
      off the front of the car.

      Seth lies motionless, still holding one of the detergent
      jugs. The cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over

                   see, we've actually trashed two other
                   cars. The first time wasn't our fault,

                   Uh...I don't know, five-foot-ten, eleven?

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   And you said those were "Pumas?"

      Seth nods. Officer Michaels and Fogell get out of the car.
      Seth and Evan see Fogell and stare in shock as he takes a
      drag of a cigarette and then flicks it aside.

      Michaels pulls Slater aside and mumbles into his ear. Fogell
      turns and sees Seth and Evan - he's completely dumbfounded!

      Evan starts to look really nervous, like he might literally
      explode. He starts to stand up.

      The cops are still talking when suddenly, Evan BOLTS!

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Shit!

      The cops run after Evan! Seth and Fogell look at each other.
      Seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the
      opposite direction of Evan! Fogell reaches into the cop car,
      grabs the bags of booze, and follows Seth.

                             FOGELL
                   Seth! Wait up!

      Officer Slater looks back to see Seth and Fogell running.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Shit! Shit! McLovin bailed!

      The cops run back into their car.

      They can't see out of the shattered windshield.

      The cops get out of the car and   run off after Seth and
      Fogell. As they run, we see the   Homeless Guy slump out of the
      car, landing on his face with a   muffled groan. He stands up,
      grabs the jug of detergent that   was left on the ground, and
      runs off.

      Fogell and an exhausted Seth are running together. Seth grabs
      Fogell and takes him around a house and towards a backyard. A
      second later, the cops run by the house and continue up the
      block.

      Seth and Fogell sprint across a big, dark backyard. Seth
      looks back to see if they are being followed...BOOM!

      He runs smack into a little red tent and trips onto it! KIDS
      inside the tent start screaming as flashlights turn on.

                             KIDS
                       (hysterical)
                   Help/ It's a monster!/ Daddy!

      Fogell helps Seth get up. They try to run, but Seth is caught
      on the tent! He drags it a couple feet as the kids start
      clawing to get out.

                             KIDS (CONT'D)
                   AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

      The zipper opens and a KID hops out. The Kid looks at Seth.

                             KID
                   AHHH!!! NO!!! DADDY!!!!

                   Holy shit! Little kids!!!

      A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From
      inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth.

                             SETH
                   Ow!

      Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell
      fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream.

                             FATHER(O.S.)
                   Get away from my children!

      The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in
      his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and
      Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them,
      narrowly missing them.

                             FATHER(CONT'D)
                   You sick sons-of-bitches!

      Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down.
      Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it.
      They can't.

                             FOGELL
                   Help!

      Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad
      coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father,
      knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges,
      enraged.

      Fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the
      alley.

      They sprint down the alley. Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing
      down as he lugs the detergent. The Father enters the alley
      and sees the boys running. He throws his baseball bat. It
      sails through the air and nails Seth in the back! He falls.

                          SETH

      Slater and Michaels, completely out of breath, desperately
      scan the area for the boys.

      Evan is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to
      reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps
      looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot -
      BLAM!!!

                          EVAN
                    (to himself, mumbling)
                Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck.

      As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he
      sees Seth and Fogell running towards him. He pops out of the
      bush, scaring Fogell and Seth.

                 FOGELL                           SETH

      They turn a corner at the end of the block and continue
      running.

      They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight
      of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass
      and make it on.

      Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll
      box, then walk towards the back of the bus.

                             HOMELESS GUY (O.S.)
                   Hey! It's you!

      Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards
      them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle.
      The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze.

                             HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D)
                   You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme

      The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. Seth steps in
      front of him.

                   Give me the booze!

      The guy shoves Seth aside and dives at Fogell.

      WE GO INTO VERY SLOW MOTION:

      - Helen's bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag.
      It VERY SLOWLY falls towards the ground.

      - Seth reaches for it, but doesn't quite grab it.

      - WE LOUDLY HEAR the bottle as it slams against the bus
      floor...but doesn't break! It slowly rises back up into the
      air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus.

      - Evan LEAPS through the air, sailing towards the precious
      Goldschlager with his arms extended.

                             EVAN
                       (in slo-mo voice)
                   GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!

      - He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly
      smashes into a pole, SHATTERING, sending little gold flakes
      everywhere.

      BACK TO NORMAL.

      The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Shit!!! Gold!!!

      He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Evan stares at
      the remains, shocked. Fogell walks over.

      The boys look at each other terrified, and get off the bus.

      Seth and Evan are looking at one another coldly as the bus

      The party is in full swing. There is loud music blaring and
      nearly a hundred people talking, dancing, and smoking.

                   Seth! Everyone, he's here! He's got it!

      Everyone turns around and sees the Seth holding all the
      liquor.

      Everyone starts cheering! Seth sets it out on the kitchen
      table; it is an impressive array of inebriates.

                          SETH
                The bar is open!

                          EVERYONE

                Yeah Seth!/Clutch!/Nice!/I can't believe
                it!/Seth did that?!/ Who the fuck is
                Seth?

      In the background, we see Evan and Fogell wander into the
      party as Jules approaches Seth.

                          JULES
                This is awesome. Thank you so much.

                          SETH
                Sorry it was late.

                          JULES
                Yeah. To be honest, people were starting
                to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I've
                got to go tell everyone the drinks are
                here. Don't go anywhere. Promise?

                          SETH
                I'll be right here.

      Jules walks off.

      Tons of kids pour themselves drinks. Seth and about six other
      kids all have overflowing shots of Jaeger.

                            SETH

      Everyone drinks and recoils from the taste. A random guy
      refills everyone's shot glasses.

      Evan walks out onto the back porch, looking for Helen. He
      sees Becca.

                             EVAN
                   Becca! Hey.

                             BECCA
                   Where have you been, you almost blew it.

                              EVAN
                   What?

                             BECCA
                   Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's
                   right over there. She's been yammering
                   about you all night.

                             EVAN
                   What? What did she say? Does she think
                   I'm a good guy? What did she say?

                             BECCA
                   It was something like, "I'll fully blow
                   him tonight."

                              EVAN
                   What?!?

      Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a
      big group of people. He gets really nervous.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do
                   I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was
                   supposed to bring her!

                             BECCA
                   Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila
                   from her parents and her and Helen have
                   been going at it. I think she'll be fine
                   in that department. I'd just go over
                   there and invite her upstairs, pronto.

                             EVAN
                   What? Oh man...
                       (so nervous)
                   But...she's totally hammered. If I get
                   with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that,
                   like, date rape?

                             BECCA
                   It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.

                              EVAN
                   I guess.

      Evan looks at Helen and takes a deep breath.

      Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of
      Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself
      in the mirror, seeming as though he's on the verge of a full-
      on panic attack.

                             EVAN
                       (panting)
                   Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants
                   to suck on your penis. That's a good
                   thing.

      He opens the Ouzo and smells it, recoiling in disgust.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Down the hatch.

      Evan takes a mighty swig, then gags and spits it out,
      spraying it everywhere.

      Fogell sits bored in front of the TV, drinking a beer. He
      watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. Everyone is
      talking and laughing while he sits alone.

      He walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls
      dancing. In the corner dancing is Nicola. He stares at her
      for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the TV.

      He changes the channel and "COPS" comes on the screen. It
      shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee
      dropping him. Fogell ponders as he watches "COPS." He throws
      back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is
      dancing in.

      He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in
      the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown
      at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.

                             FOGELL
                   They call you Nicola, right?

      else, glancing over at Jules every now and then as she walks
      around the party, sending more people to drink with him.

      - Evan in the bathroom, forcing himself to brutally suck back
      a disgusting amount of Ouzo. He sips from his beer, takes a
      deep breath, and then starts again.

      - Evan, who has drank about half the bottle and is pretty
      drunk, stands up, arms reached out, and tries to walk in a
      straight line. He does it fairly well. Frustrated, he sits
      back down and takes another disgusting swig of Ouzo.

      - Evan can't keep his balance as he tries to touch his nose
      while standing on one foot. He's drunk. He drinks from the
      tap thirstily, eats some toothpaste, fixes his collar and
      hair, and then gathers his courage, takes a deep breath, and
      steps out of the bathroom.

      Evan walks out on the balcony. He spots the circle of people
      Helen was standing in, only now Helen is laying on the
      ground, laughing hysterically. Everyone in the circle is
      looking at her and laughing as well. Evan is extremely
      nervous. Helen looks up and spots him.

                Evan!!! Hey! Come here!!!

                Help me up! None of these people will
                help me up!

      Evan notices that she seems a little drunk. He helps her up
      and she collapses onto him, forcing him to hold her up.

                          EVAN
                Hey, Helen. Sorry I was-

      Helen laughs hysterically as she latches onto Evan. He smells
      her breath. It reeks of alcohol.

      Evan's drunk, but Helen is completely fucking shit-faced!

      They both laugh and their eyes meet.

      The party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and
      drunk. Jules walks up to Seth, who is clearly piss drunk.

                          JULES
                Hey, I'm back. I had to thank the peeps
                for comin' out.

                          SETH
                    (really, really, drunk)
                Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The
                woman of the hour!

      Seth takes a swig of a beer.

                          SETH (CONT'D)
                This party's blowin' my ass off! I want
                you to have a drink with me.

      Seth offers her a beer.

                          JULES
                No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously,
                thanks for getting all the drinks. It
                really made the night.

                          SETH
                It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems,
                no problems.

      Jules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working.

                   Uh...you know...I love talking, and
                   conversing with you, you're so good at
                   it, but I can't hear you. Could we just
                   go on the...uh...balcony or something?

      Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling
      drunkenly.

                             JULES
                   Why not? I haven't conversed in ages.
                   Let's do it.

      Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and
      then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and
      after Jules.

      Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several
      times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down
      the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice
      kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue.
      After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the
      remarkably drunk Helen.

                             EVAN
                   Are you okay?

                             HELEN
                   I so flirt with you in Math.

                             EVAN
                   Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I
                   mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long
                   time-

                             HELEN
                   I know. I've wanted to get with you so
                   hard.

      Helen kisses him.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   Like...so hard.

      Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him
      again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off
      Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons.
      Evan yanks it off.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   Good...

      Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks
      like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and
      sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model.

      Evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her
      shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual.

      As Evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of
      tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and
      concentrates on untying her shoes.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   What the fuck...stupid shoe...

      Evan moves over to help her. He can't do it either.

                             EVAN
                   Shit. Can you, like, slip out?

      Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. She grabs
      a pair of scissors off a desk.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.

      She snips off the knot and slips her shoe off.

                             HELEN
                   You...take off your pants...
                       (drunkenly waving the scissors)
                   Or I'll cut `em off.

      Helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing
      Evan. He starts taking off his pants.

                   mysterious guy in the grade. Like, nobody
                   knows anything about you.

                             FOGELL
                   Well, you're about to learn a few things.

      Jules and Seth step out onto the front porch. There is no one
      else out there. The moment the door closes behind them, Seth
      turns to Jules and puts his hands on her hips. He stares into
      her eyes and moves in for the kiss.

      Jules instantly pulls back.

                          JULES
                Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.

                          SETH
                What? What's wrong?

                          JULES
                I'd...uh...prefer if we did this at some
                other time.

                          SETH
                    (confused)
                But...there is no other time. School's

                with now?

                          JULES
                Well, you're drunk. Like, really, really
                drunk.

                          SETH
                So? So are you.

                          JULES
                I'm not drunk at all. I don't even drink.

      Seth is absolutely shocked. It takes his remarkably drunk
      mind a moment to process this information.

                          SETH
                You don't drink? But...but, you told me
                to get the liquor!

      Seth looks at Jules and realizes that he's screwed up. His
      eyes start to water.

                   should be crying.

                             JULES
                   Last chance to do what?

                   To make you my girlfriend for the summer,

                   person that's ever talked to me, and I

      Evan sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just
      getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie.
      Evan's eyes widen. She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in
      a very un-sexy way.

                          HELEN
                I wore this for you. Here we go...

      Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts
      seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than
      ever.

                You're so beautiful.

      terrified!

                really incredible person for a really
                long time.

      and down.

                You've got to get hard for me...real

      Fogell is laying on his back on the bed and Nicola is
      straddling him. They are kissing. Nicola sits up and takes
      Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers.

                          FOGELL
                I've got a boner.

                          NICOLA
                Good. Do you have a condom?

      He pulls a condom out.

                            FOGELL
                And lube.

      He pulls out a little bottle of lube.

      Seth and Jules are both seated on the stairs. Seth has his
      face in his hands. Jules is patting him on the back, but
      clearly feels awkward.

                          JULES
                Seth, you...uh...

      Seth looks up at her, drunk as hell, his eyes half-open.

                AAAHHH!

      Jules clutches her eye as Seth slumps onto the patio floor,
      unconscious. She gets up, yelling in pain, as Seth opens his
      eyes.

                          JULES (CONT'D)

      Jules storms into the house, leaving Seth lying on the front
      porch. He wiggles around a bit.

                   ...sorry...

      Seth passes out again. A few moments go by, when SUDDENLY a
      cop car pulls up in front of the house. Seth opens his eyes
      and sees the cops.

                                SETH (CONT'D)
                   Oh no.

      Two cops get out and start harassing two kids smoking a joint
      on the front lawn. One of them turns on their flashlight and
      Seth sees - it's OFFICER SLATER and MICHAELS!!!

      Evan, sitting on the couch next to Miroki (Evan's partner
      from cooking class), drinking a bottle of tequila. He's
      absolutely smashed.

                             EVAN
                   Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki?

      Suddenly, Seth bursts into the room and grabs Evan's shirt.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Fuckin' wax off, asshole!

                   No...I'm helping you, man! Just listen...

      Seth grabs Evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet.

                   Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my

      Just then, Terry (the guy who spat on Seth in the beginning)
      walks by.

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! The loud authoritative knocking echoes
      through the party and everyone looks to the door, knowing it
      can only mean one thing. Someone opens the door, revealing
      Officer Slater and Officer Michaels! They talk to whoever
      answered the door, oblivious of Evan and Seth.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   We had a complaint about the noise. It
                   looks like you're having a nice little
                   party here.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   A nice little underage drinking party.

      Evan points at the cops.

                   Dude! Seth! It's the cops! The cops.

                             SETH
                   That's what I've been...! Here...

      Seth pulls Evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out
      of the living room just as the cops step into it.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Okay, everyone out. Party's over. Get out
                   of here.

      Michaels turns to Slater.

                   I'll go upstairs. I told you this would

      Suddenly, Slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming
      the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts
      backward donuts.

      Slater completely loses control of the car. He smashes
      through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light
      post, completely fucking up the cruiser.

      Slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge. He crawls

                   Alright. I think that's all the fun we're
                   gettin' out of this one.

      Slater hands Fogell his note pad.

                   ...and by signing this you are officially
                   saying that as we stopped you from being
                   mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser
                   and did God knows what with it.

                             FOGELL
                   Of course. That mugger had nothing but
                   murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.

      Fogell signs the pad.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Can we do this already?

      The cops and Fogell push the cruiser towards a small, but
      steep, hill. They shove it over the edge and watch it roll.
      It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the
      windows and crushing the front of the car.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                   Can we shoot at it?

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   I don't know, can you?

      They whip out their guns.

                             OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
                   I'm throwin' down the gauntlet. 50 bucks.
                   Whoever hits the gas tank.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   You are so fucking on.

                             FOGELL
                   Can I get a shot?

      Slater hands Fogell his gun. With a huge smile, Fogell raises
      the gun, aims it at the police cruiser, and BLASTS off round
      after round.

      Seth and Evan are lying in sleeping bags beside one another.
      The now empty bottle of Tequila lies between them. They are
      laughing very hard, still drunk off their asses.

                             SETH
                   I can't believe she said that shit.

      They laugh harder.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   And then you saved me, man! I fucking
                   love you!

                   Why don't we say that more? It feels
                   good! I love you more than my brother,
                   man. Like, when you went away for Easter
                   last year, I, like, missed you. You know?

                             SETH
                   I missed you, too. Come here, man.

      Seth grabs Evan and they hug.

                             SETH (CONT'D)
                   We'll always be friends. `Cause we love
                   each other.

      They stop hugging and sit back down. They're laughter slows
      down and there is a moment of silence.

                             SETH (CONT'D)
                   Like, three weeks ago I was in you room
                   and, like, you were taking a dump and...I
                   saw your residence placement thingy. I
                   totally saw you're living with Fogell.
                   So, like-

                             EVAN
                   I'm sorry, man.

                             SETH
                   Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was
                   being a bitch.

                              EVAN
                   I need you to know that it's not like I
                   even want to live with Fogell; it's just
                   that I'm really afraid of living with
                   strangers.

      There is a moment of silence.

                You know...I was pissed off I didn't get

                through a lot of our shit, you know?

                          EVAN
                Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we
                kind of came together, again.

      Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking.
      They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though
      they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.

                          EVAN
                Oh...uh...hey. Morning.

                          SETH
                Uh...morning.

      They stare at each other, uncomfortable.

                You sleep good?

                          SETH
                Yeah. This is a really good pillow.

                          EVAN
                Um...

      Seth looks at his watch.

                          SETH
                Maybe I should get going.

                          EVAN
                You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing
                anything.

      Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store.
      Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are
      way too small.

                             EVAN
                   Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your
                   pants look good.

                             SETH
                   Well, I need someone's opinion.

                             EVAN
                   Fine. They're way too small.

                             SETH
                   Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's
                   pants last night I realized that if I buy
                   pants that are too small it'll encourage
                   me to lose weight. And in tight pants
                   chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.

                             EVAN
                   Yeah, the male camel toe look is really
                   big this year.

      Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the
      pants. He walks out.

                             SETH
                   These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck

      They walk through the department store, when suddenly, Evan
      sees Helen and Jules looking at comforters.

                   Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I
                   actually did that.

                   I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a

                   Is that them?

      They stare at the two girls from afar.

                             EVAN
                   Should we hide?

      Helen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out
      to Jules. Seth and Evan wave back. The girls get up and start
      to walk over.

                       (pretending to smile)
                   Helen called me a pussy to my face! What
                   am I going to say to her?

      The girls walk up to them.

                  HELEN                                JULES
      Hi Evan, Seth.                       Hey guys.

                Oh man...

                          HELEN
                Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to
                buy Jules a new comforter.

                          EVAN
                Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for
                college.

                          JULES
                    (flirtatiously, joking)
                So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and
                buy me my cover-up, or what?

                           SETH
                Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such
                bad acne last year, I became an expert on
                the stuff.

                          EVAN
                You could get your college pants there.

                          SETH
                Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan
                drove me here, how do we-

                          JULES
                I've got my dad's car. I'll take you
                home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.

                          HELEN
                That sounds good.

                          EVAN
                Maybe we can go eat after?

                             HELEN
                Sweet.

      Seth and Evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their
      faces. They didn't blow it.

                          SETH
                So, uh, I'll call you later.

                          EVAN
                Yeah man, have a good one.

                          JULES
                Come on, Seth. Let's go.

      Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the
      opposite direction.

      As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back
      and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.
      A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as
      though they're never going to see each other again.

      INT. MACY'S ESCALATOR

      As Jules and Seth walk into Macy's and Helen and Evan descend
      an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome
      crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...

      THE END

      We flip through Seth's seemingly endless penis drawings from
      childhood. They are hilarious.
