           BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE FROM 1978 

                         MUSIC UP:
          A simple GAME SHOW SET -- one long desk-that houses four
          "CELEBRITY PANELISTS," a small pulpit with attached microphone
          for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the curtain to
          the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the
          celebrities -- ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and
          PEGGY CASS.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Hello, panel, and welcome everyone
          to another exciting day on "To Tell
          The Truth." Let's get the show
          started.

          THE CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE
          BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINE on the faces of THREE MEN who walk toward
          center stage. All thre n wear identical AIRLINE PILOT
          UNIFORMS, each with m; c ng blue blazers and caps.
          (cont' d)
          Gentleman, please state
          your names.

                         PILOT #1
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE steps forward.

                         PILOT #2
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE THIRD PILOT does the same.

                         PILOT #3
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          Bud smiles, grabs a piece of paper.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Panel, listen to this one.
          (he starts to read)
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr, and
          some people consider me the worlds
          greatest imposter.

                         (READING)
          From 1964 to 1966 I successfully
          impersonated an airline pilot for
          Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two
          million miles for free. During that
          time I was also the Chief Resident
          Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital,
          the Assistant Attorney General for
          the state of Louisiana, and a
          Professor of American History at a
          prestigious University in France. By
          the time I was caught and sentenced
          to prison, I had cashed over six
          million dollars in fraudulent checks
          in 26 foreign countries and all fifty
           states, and I did it all before my
           18th birthday. To this day, I am the
           only teenager ever to have been placed
          on the FBI' s most wanted list.
          My name is a Abagna l e Jr.
          Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk behind
          a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly
          the same time.

          BUD COLLY (cont'd )
          Okay, panel, you have ork cut
          out for you. Kitty Carl , you
          have the first question.

                         KITTY CARLISLE
          Imposter number one, how many years
          were you in prison?

                         PILOT #1
          I served two years in France, and
          five years in Atlanta, Georgia.

                         KITTY CARLISLE
          Imposter number two, I find all this
          very fascinating. Who was it that
          finally caught you?

          SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE --
          A thin smile across his lips as he faces the panel -- his
          manicured hands out in front of him on the desk -- his back

          2 EXT. - PAPIGONE MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. - MARSEILLE - NIGHT 2 


           SUPER: MARSEILLE, FRANCE DECEMBER 25, 1967
           A heavy rain falls on JOE SHAPE, 40's, who wears a black hat
          and holds a black umbrella as he bangs on the window of a
          small GUARDHOUSE in front of a LARGE GATED PRISON. Joe is
          sneezing as he holds up an IDENTIFICATION CARD TO THE GUARD.

                         JOE SHAPE
          Joe Shaye, FBI.

          3 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON WARDEN'S OFFICE. - DAY 3 

          Joe is walking down a long corridor inside the prison,
          struggling to close his umbrella as he faces WARDEN GARREN
          and TWO GUARDS.

                         JOE SHAPE
          I have orders see a prisoner named
          Abagnale, t e his statement and
          solicit a c n ^ n so I can prepare
          for tomorrow' tladition.
          Joe takes a roll of CASH out of h` ocket, casually slips
          the money to the Warden.

                         JOE SHAPE
          If I give you another twenty, will
          you turn up the heat in here?

          4 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON - FRANK'S CELL/CORRIDOR. - DAY 4 

          Warden Garren is leading Joe down a small, isolated corridor
          just off the main floor. They pass CEMENT DOORS with metal
          SLIDE HOLES and numbers taped to the front. There are no
          bars or windows in this area, and complete silence. Garren
          stops at the last cell and opens the SLIDE HOLE.

                         WARDEN GARREN
          Don't pass him anything through the

                         HOLE-
          Garren walks off, and Joe immediately starts to smile, looking
          around for a long BEAT as he stares at the cell door.

          Yoohoo. Hello? Is the lady of the
          house at home?
          Joe tries to control his excitement as he kneels down and
          looks through the metal slide hole.

          THROUGH THE HOLE

          5 INT. - PAPIGONE PRISON - FRANK'S CELL. - NIGHT 5 

          WE SEE FRANK ABAGNALE JR., his face partially hidden in the
          dim cell, which gets its only light from a hanging bulb.
          Frank is lying on the cement floor, his back up against the
          far wall. He wears only a pair of underwear and clutches a
          torn blanket.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Jesus, Frank, you look terrible. I
          heard about French prisons, but this
          is positively barbaric.
          WE HEAR a sound come fr)dthe cell, and then heavy coughing.
          JO,E YE (cont ' d)
          That doesn' t o d(rr4ood. I have a
          little cold my
          Help me.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Help you? Yes, I'll help you, Frank.

                         N
          Why do you think I've been fighting
          to have you extradited. Why do you
          think I came to take you home? Do
          you know that 21 other countries
          want'you in their prisons? I saw the
          list -- Egypt was on there. Who the
          hell goes to Egypt to write bad
          checks?

                         FRANK
          I'm sick... please...

                         JOE SHAYE
          Don't worry, Frank, you just have to
          make it through one more night. And
          then tomorrow I'll help you onto a
          plane, clean you up, and put you in
          a cell for the next twenty-five years.

          His face covered by a beard and matted black hair. Frank
          closes his eyes and starts to cough.

                         FRANK
          Help me, please. I can't breathe...

          OUTSIDE THE CELL
          Joe listens to Frank, who is coughing so hard he starts to
          choke.

          THE CELL DOOR IS THROWN OPEN
          Frank is being dragged across the floor by Warden Garren and
          a second GUARD, each holding an arm as they drag Frank's
          emaciated six-foot frame through the halls. Joe Shaye jogs
          behind the guards.

                         JOE SHAYE
          He's not breathing. I think he
          stopped breathing!

          A small, empty room with four empty hospital beds. Frank is
          lifted onto one of the beds, his legs and arms flailing out
          to the sides, kicking a thin curtain out from the wall.

                         JOE SHAYE
          What's happening to him?
          Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they
          start to wash their hands.
          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          What are you doing?

          ASSISTANT WARDEN GARREN
          Washing off the lice.

                         JOE SHAYE-
          He can't breath. You have to call a
          doctor.

          STANT WARDEN GARREN
          The doctor p fnl'sf in the morning.
          You can't just t him die. I have
          orders from the Embassy!
          This man is going t tradited
          to the United State am holding
          you responsible if ant happens!
          Suddenly Garren looks past Shaye -- eyeing the curtain that
          partially encloses Frank's bed. Garren slowly moves toward
          the curtain, pushes it open.

          FRANK IS GONE

          CLOSE ON GARREN
          drawing his gun and sprinting out the open door of the
          infirmary, yelling in French for the Guard to follow. Joe
          Shaye stands motionless, staring down in horror at the empty
          bed.

          legs toward the main door.
          As Frank makes his way past a row of cheering prisoners, he
          trips and falls, his body too weak to run as he starts to
          crawl across the prison floor.
          Joe and Garren easily catch up to him, Garren quickly kneeling
          down and holding his gun against Frank's head --cocking the
          weapon. Frank stops crawling, rolls over on his back and
          smiles up at Joe Shaye.

          Okay, Joe...let's go home.

          The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a
          history that goes back to 1859. In
          all those years, we have only inducted
          a handful of deserving men as lifetime
          members, an honor that has seen 187
          names enshrined on the wall of honor.
          Tonight, we make it 188. So please

          Frank William Abagnale.

          Two little mice fell in a bucket of
          cream. The first mouse quickly gave
          up and drowned, but the second mouse
          wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard,

          Laughter from the men in the room as Frank continues.
          FRANK SR. (cont'd)
          I stand here today humbled by the
          presence of Mayor Allen, and our
          club President, Jack Wright. But
          most of all, I am honored to see my

          but tonight you have made me royalty.
          And for this, I am eternally grateful.

          So they cram two hundred soldiers
          into this tiny social hall, and the
          first person to walk on stage is
          your mother. And she starts to
          dance...
          Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet,
          smiling as she tries to remember the steps.
          FRANK SR. (cont'd)
          It had been months since we had even
          seen a woman, and here's this blonde
          angel on stage -- and the men are
          literally holding their breath. And
          I turned to my buddies, and I said..

          As Frank runs off, Paula drops to her knees and scrubs the
          stain with the hem of her dress.

          This is our fault, Principal Evans.
          Frank had been at Buckley since he
          was a little boy. We had to take him
          out for personal reasons, away from
          his friends -- you know how kids
          are. He's all alone here.

          going to live with after the divorce.
          Your mother and father are leaving
          this decision up to you. For the
          record, I would like to praise both
          parents for showing such confidence
          in their son, who they believe will
          make the best decision for himself
          and his family.

          Frank walks down Broadway in his new uniform, enjoying the
          obvious glances he is getting from men and women who pass
          by. He sees a little boy pointing at him, and he gives the
          boy a playful salute. Frank can't help but smile as he drops
          his briefcase in the nearest trash can, then turns and walks
          into a bank.

          A LARGE OFFICE IN NEW YORK CITY. A POLAROID SALESMAN has
          opened a SAMPLE BOOK and is showing off page after page of

          LAMINATED I.D. BADGES.
          FRANK wears a suit and tie as he sits across from the salesman
          examining the book.

          Caribbean Air will be expanding our
          routes next year to include most of
          the East coast. I'm thinking we'll
          need several thousand badges.

                         POLAROID SALESMAN
          As you can see, we make the I.D.
          badges for almost every major airline.

                         POLAROI
          That's Pan Am. Would o' Qke the
          brochure on that one?

                         FRANK
          My boss wanted me to bring back an
          actual I.D. badge, not a brochure.

                         POLAROID SALESMAN
          That's no problem, Mister Anderson.
          We make all the badges right here
          with this equipment.
          The Salesman motions to a large CAMERA AND LAMINATOR.

          Frank is walking through KENNEDY AIRPORT, his authentic PAN
          AM I.D. BADGE secured to the front of his uniform. He walks
          up to an EASTERN AIRLINES ticket counter and smiles at the

          TICKET AGENT.

                         FRANK
          Hello. I'm a Pan Am co-pilot and I'd
          like to fly on your two-thirty to
          Miami.

          EASTERN TICKET AGENT
          You want to dead-head to Miami?

                         FRANK
          Yes. Dead-head.
          Frank hands the AGENT his I.D. BADGE and Mulligan's FAA
          license, which has been cropped at the top where Mulligan's
          name used to be. She barely glances at either-

          hair and glasses, stands at the front of the plane smiling
          at Frank -- who holds out his pink boarding slip.

          Are you my dead-head?

          Frank is led into the cockpit by Marci, trying not to react
          to the intensity of the tiny space. He immediately looks
          around for the jump-seat -- or any seat -- but sees nothing.

                         MARCI
          Frank, this is Captain Oliver. That's

          we're about to push.
          Frank continues to search for the JUMP SEAT, the panic
          starting to show on his face as Marci reaches her hand around
          to the back of the cockpit door and pulls down the small

          Frank quickly sits in the jump-seat, his hands shaking as he
          tries to strap himself in.

          Frank is staring out the cockpit window in disbelief, the
          way all kids do the first time they ride in a plane.

          Frank walks through the COCKPIT DOOR, sees Marci preparing

           Frank is lying on top of Marci -- losing his virginity --
          not moving -- just staring down at her with a bizarre look
          on his face. The lights are low, the radio is on.

          John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who
          started on the East Coast. During
          the last few weeks 2172 has developed
          a new form of check fraud, which I'm
          calling "the float". Next slide.

          Joe reaches in and turns the slide.
          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          What he's doing is opening checking
          accounts all over the country, then
          changing the micker ink routing
          numbers on the bottom of those checks.

          THE FACES OF THE FIVE FBI AGENTS, looking bored as they all
          listen to Joe, having no idea what he's talking about. Some
          of the agents are yawning, while other are doodling at their
          desks.

          This is a map of the 12 branches of

          SPECIAL AGENT WILKES
          You mean to say that those numbers
          on the bottom of a check actually
          mean something?

                         JOE SHAYE
          Yes. And if you change a number one
          to a number nine -- a check cashed
          in New York won't be sent to the
          East Coast Reserve -- but will be re-
          routed all the way to California.

          Demoted is the wrong word. It was
          more like-punished. I screwed up
          in the field.

          fuck up in the field and get punished?

          No. I've never worked in the field
          before. I was in the L.A. public

          You think you're gonna get me again,
          don't you? You'd love for me to send
          twenty agents out on Christmas Eve

          The same reason the Yankees always
          win. Nobody can keep their eyes off
          the pinstripes.

                         JOE SHAYE
          The Yankees win because they have
          Mickey Mantle.

          cream. The first mouse gave up and
          drowned, but the second mouse
          struggled so hard that he churned
          that cream into butter -- and he
          walked out. Amen.
          They all lift their heads, clearly impressed. Robert turns
          to Frank and smiles.

          it over to Frank. Frank opens t lope and pulls out a
          PAYROLL CHECK. He holds the check is hand, never looks
          at it.

          It's a fake.

          FBI DIRECTOR MARSH
          How do you know? You haven't looked
          at it.

                         FRANK
          There's no perforated edge, which
          means this check was hand cut, not
          fed. The paper is double bonded,
          much too heavy for a check. The ink
          is raised against my fingers instead
          of flat.
          Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it.

          This doesn't smell like micker. It's'

          buy at a stationery store.
          Joe and Director Marsh exchange a look.
