                          UNTITLED


























      Cameron Crowe
      December, 1998







                         UNTITLED

     1     FADE IN                                        1

     A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes
     into frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only
     the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written
     in a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and
     corrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of
     an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we
     now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."

     2     EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY                         2

     A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind
     it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
     San Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind
     is lazy, and a little bored.

     3     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY                    3

     Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he
     collects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the
     Southland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly
     thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.

     Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.
     She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's

     Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They
     stand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the
     highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering
     fake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the
     commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual
     conversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing
     letters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...
     now he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always
     pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.

                         ELAINE
               Excuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no
               word in The English Language -- "Xmas."
               It's either Merry Christmas... or Happy
               Holidays.

     The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns
     away.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -
     that's my Mom.

     TITLE: 1969

     4     EXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY                    4

     This is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo
     community.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
     common walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without
     Christmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.
     She checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides
     something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance
     to enter.  Music fades.

     5     INT. KITCHEN -- DAY                              5

     We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
     son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.
     The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen
     we see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious
     face that takes everything in.

                         WILLIAM
               - so Livia -

                         ELAINE
               -- killed everyone off so her son
               Tiberius could inherit the throne.
                    (thoughtful pause)
               Just like Nixon.

     William nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The
     world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings
     out in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,
     as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.
     She silently curses herself.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Anita, is that you?

                         ANITA'S VOICE
               Hey Mom!  I already ate.

     Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William
     peers into the next room.

     6     INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY                              6

     She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
     her.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring
     young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.

                         ELAINE
               You sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.

     The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.

                         ANITA
               I'm fine.  Already ate.

     William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as
     Mom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious
     about her daughter.

                         ELAINE
               Wait.  You've been kissing.

                         ANITA
                    (too quickly)
               No I haven't.

                         ELAINE
                    (peering at her lips)
               Yes... yes, you have...

                         ANITA
               No I haven't.

                         ELAINE
               Yes you have.  I can tell.

                         ANITA
                    (boldly)
               You can't tell.

     Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.
     To her, everything is a quest for knowledge.

                         ELAINE
               Not only can I tell, I know who it is.
               It's Darryl.

     Anita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself
     in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself
     immediately.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               And what have you got under your coat?

     This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at
     the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.
     She withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends.

                         ANITA
                    (busted)
               It's unfair that we can't listen to
               our music!

                         ELAINE
                    (weary of the issue)
               Honey, it's all about drugs and
               promiscuous sex.

                         ANITA
               Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!

                         ELAINE
               Yes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of
               drugs and promiscuous sex.  Look at
               the picture on the cover...

     CLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER

     Mom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on
     Richard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle
     look guilty under her scholarly inspection.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               ... honey, they're on pot.

                         ANITA
               First it was butter, then sugar and
               white flour.
                    (beat)
               Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,
               motorcycles.

     Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
     conversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently
     urges her to downshift.  She can't.

                         ANITA (cont'd)
               Then it was celebrating Christmas on a
               day in September When you knew it
               wouldn't be "commercialized."

                         ELAINE
               That was an experiment.  But I
               understand -

                         ANITA
               What else are you going to ban?

                         ELAINE
               Honey, you want to rebel against
               knowledge.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               I'm trying to give you the Cliff's
               Notes on how to live in this world.

                         ANITA
                    (simple and direct)
               We're like nobody else I know.

     These are the words that sting Mom most.

                         ELAINE
               I'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my
               own kids?
                    (pats chest)
               Use me.

                         ANITA
               Darryl says you use knowledge to keep
               me down.  He says I'm a "yes" person
               and you're trying to raise us in a
               "no" environment!

                         ELAINE
                    (immediately, can't help
               it)
               Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl
               doesn't hear much.

     Anita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby
     is a poster - "No More War."

                         WILLIAM
               Mom --

                         ELAINE
               Everything I say is wrong.

                         ANITA
               I can't live here!  I hate you!  Even
               William hates you!

                         WILLIAM
               I don't hate her.

                         ANITA
                    (to William)
               You don't even know the truth!

     William looks vaguely confused.

                         ELAINE
               Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.

     Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
     strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for
     the first time.

                         ANITA
               Feck  you!  All of you!

                         ELAINE
               Hey!

     Anita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,
     relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Well, there it is.  Your sister using
               the "f" word.

                         WILLIAM
               I think she said "feck."

                         ELAINE
                    (sputtering)
               What's the difference?

                         WILLIAM
                    (encouraging)
               Well.  The letter "u"...

     Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of
     The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."

     7     INT.   SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT               7

     Music continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
     male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.
     There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid
     proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some
     Hai Karate), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
     face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and
     then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,
     down to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in
     sight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.

     8     INT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED                     8

     Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much-
     older looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even
     more mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and
     glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.
     Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.
     It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring
     world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Are you really in our grade?

     9     INT. JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM -- DAY                      9

                         VOICE
                    (louder)
               Are you really in our grade?

     William turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature
     looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud
     theatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls,
     which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just
     starred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is
     desperate for acceptance.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.

                         TOBIN
               Hey guys!  Check it out!  William
               doesn't have any pubes!

     Others now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has
     never been more naked.

                         GUY # 1
               How old are you man?

                         TOBIN
               He's not a man, he's a little baby
               kid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.

                         GUY # 2
               How come you don't have any hair down
               there?

                         TOBIN
                    (in loud, funny voice)
               Where are your pubes???!!

     Their voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching
     the hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.

                         GUY # 2
               Yeah.  Where are your pubes?

     All eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental
     wheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,
     a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
     only be a merciful deity.

                         WILLIAM
                    (cool, dismissive)
               I had 'em.  I shaved 'em off.

     It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.
     Guy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is
     suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
     older boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares
     at William, and then also turns away.

     10    INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAY                              10

     William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan
     station wagon, carrying books.  ("See ya pubes!")  Mom continues
     driving William and Anita home from school.

                         ELAINE
                    (cheerfully, by rote, to
               William in back)
               Put on your seatbelt.   I don't want
               you flying through the windshield.

     Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't
     noticed.

                         WILLIAM
               We got our annuals today --

                         ELAINE
                    (cheerful, automatic)
               "Received" your annual.

                         WILLIAM
                    (looking at his photo)
               I look so much younger than everyone
               else.

                         ELAINE
               Enjoy it while you can.

     Camera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.

                         ANITA
               Mom.  It's time.

                         ELAINE
                    (pleasant, pointed)
               Can this wait until we get home?

                         ANITA
               Mom, pull over.  Tell him the truth.
               Tell him how old he is.

     Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.

                         ELAINE
                    (as in "be quiet")
               He knows how old he is.

                         ANITA
               The other kids make fun of him because
               of How young he looks.  Nobody includes
               him.

     They call him "The Narc" behind his back...

                         WILLIAM
               They do?

                         ELAINE
               What's a "Narc?"

                         ANITA
               (bleeding for her brother)
               A Narcotics Officer!

                         ELAINE
               Well what's wrong with that?

                         WILLIAM
                    (ever the peacemaker)
               Come on you guys.  It's no big deal.
               I'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a
               grade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a
               year younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --
                    (beat)
               Aren't I?

     Their silence is eloquent.

                         ELAINE
                    (confessing, in a rush)
               I also put you in first grade when you
               were five and never told you.

                         WILLIAM
                    (trembling)
               So...  I'm... how old?

     A heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now
     debate the subject with each other.

                         ANITA
               You lied to him!  You make such a big
               deal about the truth and you lied!

                         ELAINE
                    (that one hurts)
               He never asked.

                         ANITA
               What -- like he's going to ask if he's
               as old as he thinks he is?  Don't you
               realize, this is going to scar him
               forever?

                         ELAINE
               Honey... sweetheart... don't be
               Cleopatra.  We have to be his mother
               and his Dad.

                         ANITA
               You put too much pressure on him!

                         WILLIAM
                    (apprehensive)
               How... old...

                         ANITA
               And when he rebels in some strange and
               odd way, don't blame me.

                         WILLIAM
               ... am I?

                         ELAINE
                    (matter of fact)
               I skipped you an extra grade.  You're
               eleven.

                         WILLIAM
               (horrified, voice crackling)
               ELEVEN?

     He looks at his body, the information affects him physically.
     New sounds come from way down deep inside.  Mom now begins
     speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.

                         ELAINE
               So you skipped fifth grade.  There's
               too  much padding In the grades.  I
               taught elementary school.  5th grade -
               unnecessary.  Nothing happens in the
               5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no
               one talks about it.

                         WILLIAM
                    (still in shock)
               E - leven.

                         ELAINE
               And you skipped kindergarten because I
               taught it to you when you were four.

                         WILLIAM
               (still horrified, looking
                at his body)
               This explains... so much...

                         ANITA
               You've robbed him of an adolescence!

                         ELAINE
               Adolescence is a marketing tool.

                         ANITA
               He's got no "crowd"... no friends...

                         WILLIAM
               Okay!

     Anita reaches out to her brother.  With the compassion of a
     saint, she offers this:

                         ANITA
               Honey, I know you were expecting
               puberty.  You're just going to have to
               shine it on for a while.

     Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom
     monitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and
     yes, inspiring:

                         ELAINE
               Who needs a "crowd?"  You're unique.  You're
               two years ahead of everybody.  Take those
               extra years and do what you want.  Go to
               Europe for a year!  Take a look around,
               see what you like!  Follow your dream!
               You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the
               country.  Your own great grandfather
               practiced law until he was 93.  Your dad
               was so proud of you.  He knew you were a
               pronominally accelerated child.

                         ANITA
               What about me?

                         ELAINE
                    (heartbroken, can't help
               herself)
               You're rebellious and ungrateful of my
               love.

                         ANITA
               Well, somebody's gotta be normal around
               here!

                         WILLIAM
                    (blinking, still can't
               believe it)
               Eleven.

     11    INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY                         11

     William finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of
     wrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face
     hopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon
     and Garfunkel's "America."

     12    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                              12

     Anita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing
     on the stereo.

                         ANITA
               I want to play you a song that explains
               why I'm leaving, and try to listen.

                         ELAINE
               We can't talk?  We have to listen to
               rock music?

     13    EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAY                              13

     William watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,
     a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases
     into a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with
     plastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's
     life.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house
     is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)

                         WILLIAM
               Take good care of her in San Francisco,
               man.

     Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too
     young to converse with.

                         ELAINE
               How can she leave such a loving family?

     Anita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,
     placing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very
     close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the
     future.

                         ANITA
               One day you'll be cool.

     He nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans
     forward and whispers in his ear.

                         ANITA (cont'd)
               Look under your bed.  It'll set you
               free.

     Anita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:

                         ELAINE
               She'll be back.

     In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.

                         ANITA
               YEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.

                         ELAINE
               Maybe not soon...

     William watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.
     She pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
     face.

     14    INT. DARRYL'S CAR - DAY                              14

     Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
     mother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for
     him.  Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."

     15    INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHT                              15

     William locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a
     black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips
     the bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the
     amazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's Wheels of Fire...
     the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder... the Rolling
     Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out... The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds...
     Abraxas by Santana... Jethro Tull's Stand Up... The Mother's of
     Invention's We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...
     Crosby, Stills and Nash... Miles Davis' Bitches Brew... and
     The Who's Tommy... with a note taped to it.

                         ANITA (V.O.)
               "Listen to Tommy with a candle burning
               and you will see your entire future..."

     The heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him
     lighting a candle.

     TITLE:  1973

     DETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK

     A blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the
     names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with
     carefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.

     16    INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAY                         16

     William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in
     Journalism.  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,
     PATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.

     17    EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAY                              17

     William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from
     a vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the
     students... and these days, especially the girls.

     18    EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAY                              18

     William sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads
     intently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of Creem
     Magazine.  Music continues.

     CLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE

     Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and
     fashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro
     Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,
     enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty
     of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of
     massive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair
     backlit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-
     piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend
     of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.

     Drift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs.

     19    EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                              19

     William walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody
     now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their
     own cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly
     faces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and
     looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing
     something from the high-school marquee.

     HIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE

     which reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)

     All are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face
     goes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.

     20    EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAY               20

     The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
     a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the
     greatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-
     driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the
     very brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a
     then new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-
     long hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a
     glass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side
     street, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on
     the streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is
     watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small
     p.a. speaker overhead.

                         DISC-JOCKEY
               Quite an honor to have the World's
               Greatest Rock Critic... and editor of
               Creem Magazine, back Home in San Diego
               for a few days -- Lester Bangs.

                         LESTER BANGS
               What is this hippie station?!  Where's
               Iggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of
               Raw Power?!

                         DISC-JOCKEY
               Lester, isn't it a little early for
               this?

     Bangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,
     with no regard for album jackets.

                         BANGS
               Found it!!

     21    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY                              21

     William watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
     of Raw Power.   We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
     Stooges' "Search and Destroy."   A closer shot on William now
     watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy
     Pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot
     hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
     other side of this double-glass window.

     22    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER                    22

     Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
     street.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about
     fifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his
     paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
     nights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking
     guy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he
     takes big sweeping steps.

                         BANGS
               So you're the one who's been sending
               me those articles from your school
               newspaper -

                         WILLIAM
               I've been doing some stuff for a local
               underground paper, too.

                         BANGS
               What are you like the star of your
               school?

                         WILLIAM
               They hate me.

                         BANGS
               You'll meet them all again on their
               long journey to the middle.

     The kid nods, they walk.

                         BANGS (cont'd)
               Well, your writing is damn good.  It's
               just a shame you missed out on rock
               and roll.

                         WILLIAM
               I did?

                         BANGS
               Oh yeah.  It's over.

                         WILLIAM
               Over?

                         BANGS
               Over.  You got here just in time for
               the death rattle, the last gasp, the
               last grope.

                         WILLIAM
               Well.  At least I'm here for that.

     Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's
     too late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he
     doesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:

                         BANGS
               What do you type on?

                         WILLIAM
               Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

                         BANGS
               You like the new Lou Reed?

                         WILLIAM
                    (automatic)
               The early stuff.  The new stuff, he's
               trying to be Bowie, he should be
               himself.  I'm not a big Lou man.

                         BANGS
               Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and
               Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing
               Lou.

                         WILLIAM
                    (standing his ground)
               If you like Lou.

                         BANGS
               Take drugs?

                         WILLIAM
               No.

                         BANGS
               Smart kid.  I used to do speed and
               sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
               writing and writing, like 25 pages of
               dribble about, you know, the Guess
               Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you
               know, with the music blasting...

                         WILLIAM
               Me too.  The writing part...

     For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
     thing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,
     the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,
     who smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a
     pleasant but very final nod of the head.

                         BANGS
               Well, alright.  It's been nice to meet
               you.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending
               me your stuff.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.  See you.

                         BANGS
               I can't stand here all day talking to
               my many fans.

     WIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE

     But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.
     They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted
     street.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.

     23    INT. DINER -- DAY                                   23

     William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face
     is an open book filling with words.

                         BANGS
               -- so anyway, you're from San Diego
               and that's good.  Because once you go
               to L.A., you're gonna have friends
               like crazy but they'll be fake friends,
               they're gonna try to corrupt you.  The
               publicists!  The bands!  You got an
               honest face, they're gonna tell you
               everything.  But you CANNOT make friends
               with the rock stars.

     The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
     can I make a note?  Bangs nods.

                         BANGS (cont'd)
               Cannot make friends with the rock stars.
                    (savage bite)
               That's what's important.  If you're a rock
               journalist, a true journalist -- first you
               will never get paid much.  But you will
               get free records from the record company.

     The kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal
     writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate
     softie.

                         BANGS (cont'd)
               And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet
               girls... they'll try to fly you places for
               free.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It
               sounds great.  But they are not your
               friends.   These are people who want you
               to write sanctimonious stories about the
               genius of the rock stars and they will
               ruin rock and roll and strangle everything
               we love about it.

     Privately, William thrills.  We.  Our.  It all sounds great to
     him.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of
     them.  He madly scribbles.

                         BANGS (cont'd)
               They are trying to buy respectability
               for a form that is gloriously and
               righteously -

     The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.

                         BANGS (cont'd)
               - dumb!  And you're smart enough to
               know that.  And the day it ceases to
               be dumb is the day it ceases to be
               real.  Right?  And then it will just
               Become an Industry of Cool.

                         WILLIAM
               ... Industry... of... cool...

                         BANGS
               And that's what they want!  And it's
               happening right now.  I'm telling you,
               you're coming along at a very dangerous
               time for rock and roll.  The war is
               over.  They won.  99% of what passes
               for rock now... SILENCE is much more
               compelling.  It's over.  I think you
               should turn around and go back and
               be... a lawyer or something... but I
               can see from your face that you won't.
               I can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme
               a thousand words on Black Sabbath.

                         WILLIAM
                    (attempting cool)
               An assignment.

                         LESTER
               Yeah.  And you should build your
               reputation on being honest... and
               unmerciful.

                         WILLIAM
                    (writing in notebook)
               Honest... unmerciful...

                         BANGS
               And if you get into a jam -- call me.
               I stay up late.

     Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he
     scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate
     notebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit
     together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.

     24    INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHT                              24

     Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks
     out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels
     protective not just of her son, but an entire generation.
     William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.

                         ELAINE
               Look at this.  An entire generation of
               Cinderellas and there's no slipper
               coming.

     William looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
     BLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.

                         WILLIAM
               You can drop me off here.

                         ELAINE
               Black.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you
               wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill
               a Mockingbird.

     The kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               As long as I know this is just a hobby,
               I'll go along with it.

                         WILLIAM
               All I have to do is listen.  That's
               what Lester Bangs said.

                         ELAINE
                    (dryly)
               I'll be waiting right here at eleven
               'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use
               the family whistle.

     He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange
     canvas shoulder-bag and exits.

     Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
     crowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image
     troubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family
     whistle immediately.  He turns.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
                    (sweetly, too loud)
               Don't take drugs!!

     Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound
     of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her
     concern.  All around him, we hear:

                         HAPPY CONCERT GOERS
               Don't take drugs!!

     He winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open
     windows of many other cars.

     25    EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHT           25

     The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
     backstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes
     open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's
     backstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,
     this is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom
     powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
     hours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything
     about him screams that he's an angry sixty.

                         WILLIAM
               Hi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here
               from Creem Magazine to interview the
               band Black Sabbath.

     Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and
     snaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the
     door and grabs the handle.

                         SCOTTY
               Not on the list.

     He shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for
     a moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering
     Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They
     look at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings
     the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag.
     The door opens.

                         WILLIAM
               Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a
               copy of the magazine.

     The magazine hangs in mid-air.

                         SCOTTY
               You're not on the list.   Go to the
               top of the ramp with the girls!

     Slam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to
     do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by
     him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.
     Bracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly
     this time.  Scotty stands peering at him.

                         WILLIAM
                    (in a rush)
               What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
               the-ramp with-the-gi -

     Slam.  Lock.

     26    EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHT                    26

     William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
     ramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in
     their evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the
     young journalist who has been banished to stand with them.
     Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17
     years, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her
     partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns
     to the kid with great disinterest.

                         ESTRELLA
               Who are you with?

                         WILLIAM
                    (embarrassed to be alive)
               Me?  I'm with myself.

                         ESTRELLA
               No, who are you with?  What band?

                         WILLIAM
               I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
                    (beat)
               I'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you
               know...

     Estrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,
     introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
     trimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth
     and real interest in the way she asks:

                         PENNY LANE
               ... you're not a what?

                         WILLIAM
                    (enthralled)
               Oh... I'm just... not a... you know.

                         PENNY LANE
               Not a "what"?

                         WILLIAM
                    (charmed)
               You know.  A "groupie."

     The two girls are deeply insulted by the word.

                         ESTRELLA
               Ohhh!

                         WILLIAM
               Sorry, I -

                         PENNY LANE
               We.  Are not.  "Groupies."

     Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence.

                         ESTRELLA
               This is Penny Lane, man.  Show some
               respect.

                         WILLIAM
               -- sorry.

     Penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind
     her, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems
     not to hear them.

                         PENNY LANE
               "Groupies" sleep with rock stars because
               they want to be near someone famous.
               We are here because of the music.  We
               are Band Aids.

                         ESTRELLA
               She used to run a school for Band Aids.

                         PENNY LANE
               We don't have intercourse with these
               guys.  We support the music.  We inspire
               the music.  We are here because of the
               music.

     William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.
     Listening.

                         ESTRELLA
               Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's
               famous.

                         PENNY LANE
               It's a long story.  I'm retired now.
               I'm just visiting friends.

                         ESTRELLA
               She was the one who changed everything.
               She said "no more sex, no more
               exploiting our bodies and hearts... "

                         WILLIAM
               Right.  Right.

                         ESTRELLA
               "... just blow-jobs, and that's it."

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.  Well, see, now I get the
               difference.

     Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another
     breathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity
     of 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just
     like the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane.  She is POLEXIA, the
     voluptuous one, from Riverside.

                         POLEXIA
                    (the usual greeting)
               It's all happening.  It's all happening.

                         ESTRELLA
               Polexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we
               were going to be here?

                         POLEXIA
               I talked to Dick with Stillwater, I
               talked with Sabbath.  They're all dying
               to see us.   It's all happening.

                         PENNY LANE
               This is our journalist friend.
               Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,
               and Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --

                         WILLIAM
               William.

     Silent beat.  His name lands like a thud.

                         POLEXIA
               Here comes Sabbath!

                         ESTRELLA
               Ozzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!

     A long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps
     twice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls
     inside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss
     being rebuffed.

                         ESTRELLA (cont'd)
               I think I saw Sapphire in there.

                         POLEXIA
                    (can't hold it in any longer)
               Okay.  I was with Ian Hunter all night
               at Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his
               spoo?  I saved it in a baggie.

     She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.
     William edges away.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (peering into purse)
               I'm really happy he's doing so well.

                         PENNY
                    (regarding what's in purse)
               Yeah.  I know he's such a talented
               guy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves
               it more?

                         POLEXIA
                    (looking in purse)
               Nobody -- he's so sweet.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (with compassion)
               Don't you just root for him, you know.
               To go that little distance between
               good and great?

                         PENNY
               Wait.  That's not his.  I would know
               his.

     A very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet
     look.  What's in that purse?

     BAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS

     Out steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy
     eye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.
     In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,
     a fistful of backstage passes.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Does anybody remember laugh-tah?
                    (as they turn)
               Come and GET 'EM!

     The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.
     Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked
     around his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
     ramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The
     Keeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William
     forward for a pass.

                         SCOTTY
               Oh no.  Not this one --

                         SAPPHIRE
                    (off William)
               Who brought Opie?

     The kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's Opie?

                         PENNY
               He's with us.

                         SCOTTY
                    (hand blocking William)
               He wasn't with you.

                         SAPPHIRE
                    (to Scotty)
               Are you going to turn this into a
               Thing?

                         SCOTTY
               All of you can wait outside!  Top of
               the ramp!

                         WILLIAM
               I don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll
               wait.

                         PENNY
                    (privately, to William)
               I'll go take care of this.

     Sadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of
     the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'
     "Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...
     the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants
     to be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then
     it shuts.  He stands alone.

     At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --
     STILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening
     band.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and
     their road manager.  Voices booming.

     RUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his
     guitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star
     of the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.
     William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.
     The buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as
     the others now arrive behind Russell.

     Tour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on
     the steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
     hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
     silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.
     His direction is always - forward.

                         DICK
               Let us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on
               the show!!

     William is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the
     single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF
     BEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his
     head.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging
     limply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY
     TURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with
     his foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine.

                         WILLIAM
                    (to Dick)
               Hi, I'm a journalist.  I write for Creem
               Magazine.

     Once again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't give it away.

                         JEFF
               The enemy!  A rock writer!

                         WILLIAM
                    (struggling forward)
               I'd like to interview you or someone
               from the band.

                         DICK
                    (busy, running behind)
               I'm sorry but could you please fuck
               off?

     William blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes
     him up, moving in the background.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.  Okay.  I could do that.

                         JEFF
               You guys never listened to our records.
               You're all just frustrated musicians.
               Do you know what your magazine SAID
               about us?  What was it - "the singer's
               incessant cater walling distracts From
               an assault with no clear purpose."

                         LARRY
                    (in background)
               That was Rolling Stone.

                         RUSSELL
               Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We
               play for fans, not critics.

     Stung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at
     least thrillingly so.

                         WILLIAM
               Russell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.
                    (can't help it)
               I really love your band.   I think the
               song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward
               for you guys.  I think you guys
               producing it yourselves, instead of
               Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
               And the guitar sound was incendiary.
                    (gestures with fist)
               Way to go.

     He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
     Russell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to
     give up.

                         RUSSELL
                    (good humored, yelling)
               Well don't stop there.

                         JEFF
               Yeah, come back here!!  Keep going!

     They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The
     kid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,
     through the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
     off.

     Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him
     forward.

                         SCOTTY
               Not this one.

                         RUSSELL
               He's with us.

                         SCOTTY
               He's not with you.  He's not with them.
               He's not on the list.  He's not coming
               in.  And this is my arena.  And
               furthermore -

     Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to
     Scotty.

                         SCOTTY (cont'd)
               - have a good time tonight.   Welcome
               to San Diego.

     27    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHT                         27

     The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving
     to keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,
     catches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.

                         RUSSELL
               Red Dog!

                         RED DOG
               We're playing here tomorrow night.

                         JEFF
                    (aside, to the kid)
               This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers
               Band's number one roadie.

     Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.

                         RUSSELL
               How're the guys?

                         RED DOG
               Havin a ball, man.  When we have a
               party, we have an Allman Brothers Band
               party.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody
               gets off.  It's family, man.  We all got
               These now.
                    (flashes new mushroom tattoo
               on forearm)
               We'll see you guys in Boston, right?
                    (specifically to Russell)
               Dicky and Gregg send you their love.

     Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as
     Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.

     28    INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT                         28

     Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply
     listens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away
     little of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other
     band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and
     roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
     for the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.

                         RUSSELL
               ... and it's okay, because rock and
               roll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of
               thinking and it's not about money and
               "popularity!"

                         JEFF
               Some money would be nice.

     Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into
     his scalp - poor man's mousse.

                         RUSSELL
               - but it's a voice that says here I
               am... and FUCK YOU if you can't
               understand me.

     Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
     from his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up
     details of rock.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               And one of those people is gonna save the
               world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
               CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.

     The kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the
     recording.  He listens intently.

                         JEFF
               And the chicks are great.

                         RUSSELL
               But we didn't do it for that!  We are
               here because we needed to fuckin be
               here, not just 'cause we needed to
               away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE
               DID... but what it all comes down to
               is that thing. The Indefinable Thing,
               when people catch something from your
               music, the thing you put into it.  I'm
               talking about... what am I talking
               about?

                         WILLIAM
                    (elegantly)
               The buzz?

                         RUSSELL
               THE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the
               whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ.
               And like -- you saying you liked "Fever
               Dog?"   That is the fucking buzz, man.
               All we get are these fucking old-ass
               interviewers who don't understand,
               don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we
               are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.

     William nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his
     guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.
     Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.

                         JEFF
               The next album will be even better.
               More texture.

                         RUSSELL
               But... it's not what you put in, is
               it?  It's what you leave out.  Listen
               to... listen to Marvin Gaye...

     Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
     music.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               A song like "What's Going On."  That
               single "woo" at the end of the second
               verse - you know that woo - that single
               "woo."

                         WILLIAM
                    (proudly)
               I know that, "woo."

                         RUSSELL
                    (he does it)
               That's what you remember.  The silly
               things, the little things... there's
               only one, and it makes the song.  It's
               what you leave out.  That's rock and
               roll.

     William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
     Activity surrounds him.

                         JEFF
                    (impressed)
               We used to talk more about this stuff.

                         RUSSELL
               Okay.  See, this is maybe the most
               honest we've ever been in an interview
               because you know our music.  You're
               the first press guy we've made friends
               with.  We don't normally talk like
               this to them.  And you're supposed to
               be The Enemy!  What are you - 18?

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.

                         RUSSELL
               There you go.  Still young enough to
               be honest.

                         DICK
                    (walkie talkie crackling)
               Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who
               isn't in the band -- out!

     Russell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar
     away.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               All this luggage is going to L.A.!

     William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,
     past the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of
     suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a
     number.

     29    INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER               29

     William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his
     notebook.  Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots
     into place.

                         PENNY LANE
               I found you a pass.

                         WILLIAM
                    (amped, distracted)
               Thanks.  I got in with Stillwater.
                    (as he writes)
               The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he
               just thoroughly opened up.  He is by
               far the best and most honest interview
               I've ever done.
                    (she nods)
               I've only done two, but you know.
               He's number one.

                         PENNY LANE
               You're learning.  They're much more
               fun on the way up.

     William nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on
     the step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at
     her, his eyebrows rising.  She smooths them down with two single
     fingers.

                         PENNY LANE (cont'd)
               How old are you?

                         WILLIAM
               Eighteen.

                         PENNY LANE
               Me too.
                    (beat)
               How old are we really?

                         WILLIAM
               Seventeen.

                         PENNY LANE
               Me too.

                         WILLIAM
               Actually I'm 16.

                         PENNY LANE
               Me too.  Isn't it funny?  The truth
               just sounds Different.

                         WILLIAM
                    (confesses)
               I'm 15.

                         PENNY LANE
               You want to know how old I really am?

                         WILLIAM
                    (immediately)
               No.

     She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning
     up.  Music is her religion.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               How did you get started in all this?

                         PENNY LANE
               It's a long story.

                         WILLIAM
                    (quick study)
               Right.  Right.

                         PENNY LANE
               We live in the same city.  We should
               be friends.

     She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his
     thigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door
     opens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as
     they mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped
     voice of Russell growing nearer.

                         RUSSELL
               The Enemy!

     He approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out
     of Russell's eyesight.

     Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to
     introduce his new friends.

                         WILLIAM
               Russell, this is Penny Lane.

                         PENNY LANE
                    (stepping into view)
               Pleasure.

                         RUSSELL
               Penny Lane?  Like the song, right?

                         PENNY LANE
               Have we met?

     THEY SHAKE

     And do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their
     shake.  Their eyes tell all.  Shot takes us to William, who
     puts two and two together.  It isn't hard.  They clearly know
     each other. Well.

                         WILLIAM
               Well, I guess you've... you've met.

                         DICK
               Penny Lane!  God's gift to rock and
               roll!!  You're back!
                    (privately)
               Marc Bolan.  Please.

     Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time,
     waiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song
     "Penny Lane."

                         RUSSELL
               Come on, let's go.
                    (noting kid's shyness)
               Both of you.

     30    INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT                              30

     House lights go down.  Cheers rise.  Dick's flashlight dances
     on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the
     dark to the stage steps.

                         RUSSELL
               - get in the huddle.

     Russell pulls William into the band's huddle.

     SHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM

     Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's
     shoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic
     "Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington
     ad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage.
     Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.
     Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --
     thwack.  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage
     private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff
     no audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to
     address the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite
     moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.

                         DICK
               From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --
                    (importantly)
               Stillwater.

     Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening
     song, "If You Say Nothing."  Audience response is strong.
     Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
     undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty
     seconds.

     Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
     vocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,
     at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an
     elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
     belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first
     guitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny
     watching Russell.

     31    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATER                         31

     Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads
     for their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,
     like a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying
     goodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath
     passes with entourage, heading to the stage.

                         RUSSELL
                    (privately)
               So.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll
               be at the "Riot House" all week.

                         WILLIAM
               "The Riot House?"

                         RUSSELL
               The Continental Hyatt House!  It's on
               Sunset Strip.

                         WILLIAM
                    (attempting cool)
               Right.  Right.

     All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the
     backstage crowd of hangers-on.  Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.

                         DICK
               Let's blow this burg!

                         RUSSELL
                    (exiting)
               Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane
               to Call Me.  Tell her "It ain't
               California without her.  We want her
               around like last summer."   Say it
               like that.

                         WILLIAM
               Got it.

                         RUSSELL
                    (returns, whispers)
               Oh, I'm under the name - Harry Houdini.

                         JEFF
                    (exiting, to William)
               The Enemy!!  Yeah!!    Come to L.A.,
               we'll take some more.

     Russell joins Jeff, exiting and laughing.  A good show is still
     in the air.

                         WILLIAM
               Later Jeff!  See you, Dick.  Larry.
               Ed.
                    (and now the roadies)
               Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty,
               Estrella, The Wheel!

               ROADIES                  DICK
       Laterrrr!                We'll see you down the
                              line.

     William is deliriously happy, hands upraised.  He turns to see
     Penny.

                         WILLIAM
               PENNY!

                         PENNY
                    (calming him)
               Hey.  Hey.  Be cool.

                         WILLIAM
               You just missed Russell!  He says he's
               at the "Riot House" all week and to call
               him.  He's under the name Harry Houdini.
               Do you know about the "Riot House?"

                         PENNY LANE
               I think I've heard of it.

                         WILLIAM
               He had a message for you!  He said,
               "It's not California without you.  We
               want you around like last summer."
                    (consults notebook)
               Actually he said "ain't."  "It ain't
               California - "

                         PENNY LANE
               I get the gist.

                         WILLIAM
               How well do you guys know each other?

     She smiles privately.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               I got it.  No problem.  Long story.
               Alright!  I gotta go.

     Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet
     Leaf."  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.
     He heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.
     They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they
     exit out into the ramp area.

     32    EXT. SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT                         32

     Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the
     back of his green notebook.

                         PENNY LANE
               Call me if you need a rescue.  We live
               in the same city.

                         WILLIAM
               I think I live in a different world.

     They stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent
     now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In
     the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.

                         PENNY
               Speaking of the world.  I've made a
               decision.
                    (a very serious secret)
               I'm going to live in Morocco for one
               year. I need a new crowd.

     He nods.  He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
               Do you want to come?

                         WILLIAM
               Yes.

     In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.

                         PENNY
               It's a plan.  You've got to call me.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.

                         PENNY
               It's all happening.

                         WILLIAM
               It's all happening.

     He nods cooly.  He waits until she turns, and the sprints
     through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle.

                                         FADE OUT:

     FADE IN:

     33    ON TAPE RECORDER                                   33

     William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind.  We
     hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview,
     full of overlapping and barely discernible voices.
     Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's,
     as he transcribes.

     INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

     The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona
     Galaxis.  There is a knock at the window, and William scoots
     back in his chair to see a familiar face.  It is Darryl, his
     sister's old boyfriend.  William opens the window.

                         WILLIAM
               Hey Darryl.

                         DARRYL
               Hey.

     Darryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was
     once the site of his previous glory.

                         DARRYL (cont'd)
               So she's a stewardess now.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.  She and Mom are still sorta...
               I'd say "not speaking," but I don't
               know if they ever did.

                         DARRYL
               Your sister.  A stewardess.
                    (nods to himself)
               The things your sister and I did inside
               these four walls...

                         WILLIAM
               That's okay.  I don't want to know.
               It's my room now.

                         DARRYL
               We flew the friendly skies -

                         WILLIAM
               Okay -

                         DARRYL
               I don't want to put you in the middle
               of anything.  We don't have to talk
               about it.

                         WILLIAM
               No.

                         DARRYL
               You seem cooler.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.  I'm thinking about going to
               Morocco.

                         DARRYL
               Lemme know if you need a little help
               with your Mom.

                         WILLIAM
               A little might not be enough.

                         DARRYL
               She still freaks me out.

                         WILLIAM
                    (nods, an old issue)
               Yeah -

                         DARRYL
               She's famous.

                         WILLIAM
               Listen -

                         DARRYL
               Go ahead and do what you were doing.
               I just wanna hang in here for a moment.

                         WILLIAM
               Cool.  Alright.

     William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl
     sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room.  A long
     moment passes.  Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.

                         DARRYL
               Okay, man.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay, man.

     34    INT. LIVING ROOM -- EVENING                         34

     William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt.  Well,
     it's definitely a look.  Mom appears more nervous than her
     son.

                         ELAINE
               I worry about the drunk drivers.

                         WILLIAM
               Mom.  I'm 15.
                    (beat, vague panic)
               Right?

                         ELAINE
               Yes, you're 15. "And here's that money
               I owed you."

     She reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty
     bucks.  It's their routine.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Your dad's favorite joke.  I don't do
               it as well.

                         WILLIAM
               I thought it was pretty good.

                         ELAINE
               Keep the small bills on the outside.
               And call me if anyone gets drunk.

                         WILLIAM
               I will call you if anyone
               anywhere gets drunk.

                         ELAINE
               Good.

                         WILLIAM
                    (anticipating her, like a
               parent)
               And don't take drugs.

                         ELAINE
                    (stoic)
               Ha ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of
               humor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm
               glad you're making friends.

     They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind
     her she's not going.  He opens the door.  She's a wreck, and
     she knows it.

                         WILLIAM
               Mom?

                         ELAINE
               Yeah -

                         WILLIAM
                    (loving but firm, as if to
               a dog.)
               Stay.

                         ELAINE
               Oh... okay.

                         WILLIAM
               I-love-you-bye.

     He opens the door.  Neil Young.  "Sugar Mountain."  Watching
     him leave is always a killer.  She's not getting any better at
     it either.  She folds her arms tightly across her chest.

     35    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                         35

     Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different
     more elegant look.  She cups her hands and yells up to him.
     He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost
     falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.

     36    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER NIGHT                    36

     Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
     Boulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led
     Zeppelin's "Dancing Days."  William takes it all in from the
     passenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
     beer, but albums.  It's a wondrous piece of geography for any
     rock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in.
     He moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her
     windshield is cracked along the side.

                         PENNY LANE
               The Continental Hyatt House.  Also known
               as The Riot House.
                    (does tour guide voice)
               Every band stays here, all the ones
               that matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin.
               Alice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American
               bands.  We all know each other.  Twenty-
               four hour room service.  Like us, they
               were outsiders.  They were so outside,
               they're inside, and insiders never
               even knew it, because they're outsiders
               and they are inside a place outsiders
               will never be.  And why are we even
               talking about it?  If you're really an
               insider, you're never gonna say it.
               You know what I mean?

                         WILLIAM
                    (beat, working it out)
               Yeah.  Yes.

     She makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the
     hotel.

                         PENNY
               And we're not gonna hang out with
               Russell.  You can, but not me.

                         WILLIAM
               What is it with you and Russell?

     37    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT                         37

     Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across
     the Strip.  It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET.  Penny
     now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's
     hand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across
     the busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He
     steadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass
     one of several humming tour busses parked out front.

     38    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT                         38

     Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her
     arm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
     than most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
     Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling
     Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
     taller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,
     illicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny
     attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.

                         PENNY LANE
               It's all happening.
                    (grabbing him like a shield)
               And I'm about to use you as protection.

                         ROADIE # 1
               Penny Lane!!

                         PENNY LANE
                    (aside)
               These guys are with Alice Cooper.  I'm
               going to pretend I don't know them.

                         ENGLISH ROADIE # 2
               Penny!!  Does Alice know you're here?

                         PENNY LANE
               I'm just showing my very dear, very
               wonderful friend around.  He's a very
               important writer - he knows Lester
               Bangs.
                    (English accent)
               I'm responsible for his moral conduct
               while he's abroad.

                         ROADIE # 3
                    (arriving, mock drama)
               Penny Lane!!   God's gift to rock and
               roll!!

                         PENNY LANE
               I'm retired.
                    (uses English accent)
               And don't argue with me!

                         ROADIE # 3
               Again?

                         PENNY LANE
                    (moving, English accent)
               Have we met?

     Effortlessly touching an arm here and there, charming all -
     she had four men suddenly circling her.

                         PENNY LANE (cont'd)
               I've made a decision.  I'm going to go
               traveling in India.  Then I'm going to
               learn how to play the violin.  Then
               I'm going to go to college for one
               year.

     William looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt.  What about
     Morocco?

                         ROADIE # 2
                    (exiting, not buying it)
               There's nothing they could teach you
               in college, darling.
                    (whispers)
               Call Alice.  He's under the name Bob
               Hope.

                         ROADIE # 1
               I heard you were with Russell from
               Stillwater.

                         PENNY
               Please.  I throw the little ones back.

     Lusty laughs circle William.  Overlapping this dialogue is the
     appearance of our friend Polexia.

                         POLEXIA
                    (in tears, in pieces,
               emotional)
               Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole!

                         WILLIAM
               Polexia!

                         POLEXIA
               Opie!!!

     She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of
     him.  And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC
     NUNEZ, 14.  His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal
     and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he
     wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.
     It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO
     BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL."  A felt-tip pen is still in his
     quivering hand.  Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:

                         RIC
               It's all happening.   I just saw them
               on the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page...
               Mr. John Paul Jones...
                    (displays squiggle on shirt)
               Mr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in
               the elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he
               touched this pen.  Please don't smear
               it.  And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle
               in the hotel!

                         PENNY
               Ric is a Zeppelin fan.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah, I picked that up.

                         PENNY
               He tours with them, but not "with"
               them.

                         RIC
               They're on the 12th floor, but there's
               guards there!  So you gotta go to the
               tenth floor and go up the back steps.

                         PENNY LANE
               This is my very dear, very close, very
               wonderful friend William Miller, he is
               very close with Lester Bangs.

                         RIC
               It's all happening!!  See you in
               Cleveland!

     Ric rushes back to the elevators.

                         PENNY LANE
               I'm retired!  Doesn't anybody believe
               me!?

     39    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY PHONE -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER          39

     Penny nearby as William picks up the house phone.  He shouts
     over the din.

                         WILLIAM
               Harry Houdini, please.

     As he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and
     pencil next to the housephone.

     40    INT. HALLWAY/RUSSELL'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT               40

     William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway,
     looking for the room.  William looks in the passing open doors,
     each one a different window into another world.

                         PENNY LANE
               Okay.  Time to put on the lampshade.

     Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.
     Inside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom
     box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's
     "Gallows Pole."   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,
     jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing
     echoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all
     members of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath
     and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite
     directions.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with
     proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

                         PENNY LANE (cont'd)
               "Ladies and Gentlemen.  Please
               extinguish all smoking materials and
               notice that the captain has turned on
               The No Smoking sign.  Your seat and
               tray tables should be locked in their
               full and upright positions."

                         RUSSELL/OTHERS
               PENNY!!  PENNY LANE!!

     She is instantly and overwhelmingly, the life of this party.
     Russell joins William.

                         RUSSELL
                    (impressed to see him)
               Alright.

                         WILLIAM
                    (happy to be there)
               Alright.

     Russell places a beer in William's hands, and exits.

                         PENNY LANE
                    (continuing)
               "In the unlikely event of a water
               landing, the seat below you will serve
               as a -"
                    (give up)
               Oh, the hell with it.

     They all applaud her, laughing.  William watches her with
     wonder, as she turns his way and winks.  Jeff approaches the
     alluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer.  Meanwhile,
     Polexia sidles up to William.  She sees him watching Penny at
     the other side of the room.

                         POLEXIA
                    (privately)
               Act One, in which she pretends she
               doesn't care about him.

     POV shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always
     a part of his body.  Russell is watching Penny Lane
     surreptitiously.

                         POLEXIA (cont'd)
               Act Two, in which he pretends he doesn't
               care... and goes right for her.

     Russell moves towards Penny.

                         POLEXIA (cont'd)
               Act Three, in which it all plays out
               the way she planned it.  She'll eat
               him alive.

                         WILLIAM
                    (worried)
               We've got to stop them.

                         POLEXIA
               Stop them?  You were her excuse for
               coming here.

     ON PENNY

                         PENNY
               I need ice!

     Penny disappears out the door, across the hallway.  Russell
     follows a moment later.  The kid's eyebrows rise.  Polexia
     regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling
     a hair off his jacket.

                         POLEXIA
               I just worry about people using her.
               You know?  'Cause she brings out the
               good side in everybody else, but what
               do they do for her?  Life kills me.
               Do you have any pot?

                         WILLIAM
               Not on me.

                         POLEXIA
               Do you smoke?

                         WILLIAM
               No.
                    (attempting to fit in)
               But I... I grow it.  I grow it.

     Polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying.

                         POLEXIA
               You're funny.  You know, if you were
               only taller, English, rich, a guitar-
               player and older...

                         WILLIAM
               I'd be someone else.

                         POLEXIA
               Yeah.  Good point.

     Jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear
     before she exits with Jeff Bebe.

                         POLEXIA (cont'd)
               Bless me father for I may sin tonight.

     The kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of
     Russell's, Eddie Giles' "Losin' Boy."  There is the sound of a
     motorcycle somewhere down the hallway.

     41    INT. ICE ROOM -- NIGHT                              41

     The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise.  Penny
     puts ice in her glass.  Behind her, Russell moves into frame,
     hands delicately riding the sides of her body.  A motorcycle
     roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from
     Russell's exploring hands.

                         PENNY
                    (with real indignation)
               How does it end?

                         RUSSELL
               What?

                         PENNY
               You know - the story about the girl
               who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex
               wife -- the one we don't talk about --
               and gets a hundred... okay, five letters
               from him, and then doesn't even leave
               a pass in San Diego.  Wake up!  I'm
               retired and I never believed you anyway.
               You're too talented and too good-looking
               to be trusted and everybody knows it.

                         RUSSELL
                    (smiling, loves it)
               You're retired like Frank Sinatra is
               retired.

     She makes a scoffing noise.  He moves to the ice machine, with
     a glass of his own.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Miss Penny Lane.  Let me tell you what
               rock and Roll will miss the day you
               truly retire.

     He tosses cubes in his glass, one by one.  After the first cube:

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               The way you turn a hotel room into a
               home.
                    (cube)
               The way you pick up strays wherever
               you go.  Like Pied Piper.
                    (cube)
               The way you know the words to every
               song.  Every song.  Especially the bad
               ones.  Mostly the bad ones.
                    (cube)
               That green coat in the middle of summer.
                    (cube)
               The real name you won't reveal.
                    (cube)
               And.  I'd keep going, but my glass if
               full.

                         PENNY
                    (quietly)
               Damn.

     He kisses her powerfully, hands at his sides.  She fights to
     keep her hands off him.  Bonham's motorcycle rips by, just
     outside the door.

                         RUSSELL
               Come to Arizona.

                         PENNY
               Never.

                         RUSSELL
               We leave Thursday morning.  9 AM.  And
               pack light this time.  Jesus.

     They kiss.  The motorcycle speeds by again, just outside.

     42    INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT                              42

     The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door
     of the ice room.  He leans against the wall, alone now.  Trying
     to look like he belongs.  Behind him, most of the band has
     disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their
     places.

     43    INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY                    43

     Music.  We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor.
     These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone
     Magazine.  We have arrived for the waning days that this
     magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an
     "underground" publication.  Their mounting success crowds the
     edges of every frame.  Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz
     portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart,
     James Taylor.

     We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29,  in his cramped cubicle.
     Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff
     writer, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long
     holder.  Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.

                         BEN FONG-TORRES
               William Miller?

                                         INTERCUT:

     INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     William is on the phone in his own small room.

                         WILLIAM
               This is he.

                         BEN
               Crazy.  William, this is Ben Fong-
               Torres.  I'm the music editor at Rolling
               Stone Magazine.  We've got a copy of
               your stories from the San Diego Door.
               This is the same William Miller?

     William instantly, nervously alters his voice to sound older.

                         WILLIAM
               Yes it is.

                         BEN
                    (rifling through tearsheets)
               Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit
               of rock And roll... this is good solid
               stuff.

                         WILLIAM
                    (immediately, suddenly
               deeper)
               Thanks... thanks.

                         BEN
               You should be writing for us.  Any
               ideas?

                         WILLIAM
                    (voice now to deep)
               How about Stillwater?

                         BEN
               Crazy.  New album... their third...
               starting to do something.

     Ben shuffles through papers, looking for a tour itinerary on
     his promotional-material laden-desk, automatically plotting
     the piece aloud.

                         BEN (cont'd)
                    (pleasant, terse)
               Stillwater.  Hard-working band makes
               good.  Get 'em to respond to the critics
               who dismissed the first two albums as
               workmanlike. Guitarist is the clear star
               of the band.  Crazy.  Let's do three-
               thousand words.  You'll catch up to them
               on the road.  We'll set up billing --
               don't let the band pay for anything.

                         WILLIAM
                    (affecting casualness)
               Sounds good.

                         BEN
               We can only pay -- lemme see, three-
               thousand words -- seven hundred dollars.

     The kid's eyes widen.

                         BEN (cont'd)
               Alright, a grand.   What's your
               background?  You a journalism major?

                         WILLIAM
                    (deeply)
               Yes.

                         BEN
               What college --

     INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

     Elaine now gets on the extension.

                         ELAINE
               Honey, I need you to do that thing
               that fixes the garbage disposal --

     She hangs up.

     INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     The kid is paralyzed.

                         BEN
               Well, I know how my lady gets when I
               don't Snap to it -

                         WILLIAM
               Crazy.

                         BEN
               Crazy!  I'll let you go.  Call me at
               the San Francisco office tomorrow.

     44    INT. LESTER BANGS HOME -- LATE NIGHT                    44

     The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged
     bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at Creem
     Magazine.  There is nothing in frame that does not deal with
     music.  In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane
     record.

                         LESTER BANGS
               Beware Rolling Stone Magazine.  They
               will change your story, they'll re-
               write it and turn it into swill.
               Beware!!

                         WILLIAM
               But besides that, what would be wrong
               with it?

                         LESTER BANGS
                    (laughs, entertained)
               You have starry eyes, my friend.
                    (beat)
               Look.  Do the story.  It's a good break
               for ya.  But remember this --

     The kid listens intently, and makes notes.

                         LESTER BANGS (cont'd)
               ... don't do it to make friends with
               people who are trying to use you to
               further the big business desire to
               glorify worthless rock stars like
               Stillwater.  And don't let those swill
               merchants re-write you.

                         WILLIAM
                    (still copying)
               ... swill merchants...

                         LESTER BANGS
               Now.  What are you listening to?

     45    EXT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE -- DAY                         45

     William knocks on the teacher's lounge door.  A Teacher answers,
     protective of their sanctuary.

                         WILLIAM
                    (urgently)
               I need to talk to Mrs. Deegan, from
               Journalism.

     Mrs. Deegan appears in the doorway.

     46    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- LATE AFTERNOON                    46

     The sun is still shining.  It's late afternoon, as Elaine Miller
     exits her car and arrives home.  She sees a few extra cars in
     the driveway, is immediately suspicious.

     47    INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                    47

     Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs. Deegan and Darryl awaiting
     her in the living room.  It's a 1973-style intervention.  They
     wear sunny, compassionate smiles.

                         ELAINE
               Whatever it is, the answer is no.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               Elaine, we need to talk to you.
               Nothing is wrong.  I am a teacher.
               You're a teacher.  We speak the same
               language.

     Mom sits down.  She is fully engaged and worried, her natural
     state.

                         MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
               Now I'm not a jump-up-and-down person,
               but something wondrous has happened to
               William.  And you have every reason to
               be happy...
                    (knows her)
               ... and calm.

     Carefully gauging Elaine's face, the teacher continues.

                         MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
               William has been gifted with a shining
               opportunity in the world of journalism.
               Through a love of music, and at an
               oddly-young age, he has received a major
               assignment from a national publication
               called Rolling Stone Magazine.

     Mrs. Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap.
     It sits there like the plague.

                         MRS. DEEGAN (cont'd)
               Now you are rather famously not a fan
               of rock music, but such are the ironies
               of life, that happens to be the very
               topic of William's assignment -
                    (cheerfully)
               - rock music.  A band.

                         ELAINE
                    (warily, to Darryl)
               Honey, what are you doing here?

                         DARRYL
               Moral support.

     Mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small
     living room.

                         ELAINE
               What's involved?

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               Well.  It's a great opportunity.  He'll
               be well-paid, and published nationally --
                    (quickly)
               -- and he'll go on tour with a rock
               band for four days.  No small planes...
               he travels on a bus.

                         ELAINE
               Is it time for me to say something?

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               Sure.

                         ELAINE
               No.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               And in anticipation of that response -

                         ELAINE
               No.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               -- William has prepared --

                         ELAINE
                    (rueful)
               "Lo, that which I have feared has come
               upon me."

                         WILLIAM
                    (lightening fast)
               "He who jealously guards his fears,
               quietly yearns to bring them about!"

     Mrs. Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying,
     makes an impressed noise.

                         ELAINE
                    (with compassion)
               No.  I have raised him to be an honor
               student, which he is.  We have agreed
               on all our goals.  We raised him to be
               a lawyer, we moved here to be near the
               finest law school in the West.  Plus,
               he has finals coming up, and in one
               week he graduates with all his friends
               -

                         DARRYL
               He's got no friends!!

                         WILLIAM
               Darryl.  Please.

     Nearby, having anticipated all of the above, William nods to
     Mrs. Deegan, and stands.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               Elaine, may I present to you... your
               own son.

     William takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom.

                         WILLIAM
               Lady of the Jury.
                    (beat)
               I wish to disprove the prevailing false
               belief that rock music is based on drugs
               and sex.  True, perhaps at one time...
               but rock music is different now.  It is
               now performed by hard-working
               intellectuals, with... with blazing
               intellectual pursuits, and I am going to
               play for you a piece of music designed
               to show you that my thesis is correct.

                         ELAINE
               This is going to be hell.

     Across the room, Darryl takes his position near the stereo.

                         WILLIAM
               The song is based on the literature of
               Tolkien...  and it's mystical attempt
               to elevate humanity has been successful
               throughout the world...  this song
               will change your life.

     Mom stifles a cough.  William nods to Darryl, who reverentially
     drops the needle with a thud.  Mom is trapped, as we listen to
     silent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's
     "Stairway to Heaven."  William gives his Mother the album
     cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               We ask you only to listen.

     Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces.  The
     intro in not short.  We listen, just watching their faces, as
     Elaine becomes increasingly impatient.

               ELAINE                    WILLIAM
       When is it going to start -   Soon.

     Immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins.  ("There's a lady
     who's sure all that glitters is gold.")

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     48    SUN MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY                         48

     Sprinklers click across the lawns.  ("... and it makes me
     wonder... ")

     49    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON                         49

     Mom adjust herself in the chair, listens politely, checks her
     watch.  She looks at William.

     50    EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON                              50

     Sprinklers continue.  ("If there's a bustle in your hedgerow...
     ")

     51    INT. LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON                         51

     Mom listens fitfully.  The song continues.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     52    EXT. HOUSE -- STILL LATER AFTERNOON                    52

     Sprinklers shut off.  Music is now blasting.  ("To be a rock,
     and not to roll... ")

     53    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON                    53

     Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end.  ("... and she's
     buying the Stairway to Heaven.")  The song ends.  Silence.
     All look to Elaine.  They wait on her response.  We hear the
     turntable arm return to its cradle.

                         ELAINE
               What am I supposed to say?   You say
               it's Tolkien, fine.  They sound like
               nice kids.  Is it meant to elevate
               humanity?  "Sure, let's elevate
               humanity.  After we sell you drugs and
               sex."  All I have is my honesty.  That's
               what I believe, and that's what I know.
                    (flipping through magazine)
               Oh.  Here's a nice ad.

     She holds up the magazine.  And ad reads, in large bold type:
     BUY THIS FUCKING ALBUM.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               You've clearly ganged up on me, and I
               still say no.  No no no no no no no.

     She shuts her eyes, and blurts out something against her better
     judgement.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               NO MORE THAN FOUR DAYS AND I WANT A
               PHONE NUMBER FOR WHERE YOU ARE EVERY
               MINUTE AND I WANT YOU TO CALL ME TWICE
               A DAY AND YOU'D BETTER NOT MISS ONE
               TEST - AND NO DRUGS.

     William nods gratefully, and exits frame.  Hold on the empty
     chair, as drums herald the beginning of the Allman Brothers
     Band's "Trouble No More" from Live at Fillmore East.

     SHOT MOVES IN ON ELAINE

     who feels a very particular kind of loneliness.  It's the
     loneliness she got married, and then raised a family, to escape.

     54    INT. STILLWATER TOUR BUS -- DAY                         54

     An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle,
     taking us to William.  William picks up the bottle and places
     it in the seat back pocket in front of him.  He has joined the
     circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and
     forbidding than he expected.  The bus struggles to make it up
     the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.

                         DICK
               C'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can
               make it!

     55    EXT. NEVADA DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY                         55

     The Stillwater Tour Bus rumbles down the desert highway.  The
     destination banner reads - ALMOST FAMOUS -- TOUR 73.  Music
     continues.

     56    INT. BUS - DAY                                    56

     William strains for a look at Russell five rows up.  He plays
     slide guitar, working out a part.   Next to Russell is Penny
     Lane.  Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash
     - takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.

                         PENNY
               Gotcha.

     Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover.  Penny stuffs the
     shot in her pocket.  William watches, his private heart pounds.
     Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.

                         POLEXIA
               Do you have any pot?

                         WILLIAM
               No.  I'm a journalist.

                         POLEXIA
               Well, go do your job then.  You're on
               the road, man.  It's all happening!  Get
               in there.  Go talk to 'em!

     Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell.  He fixes
     the charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down
     the aisle to the jamming star guitarist.  He crouches in the
     aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody.  His
     mood is in the air.

                         WILLIAM
                    (very professional)
               Russell.   Do you think we might be
               able to find some time to talk when we
               get to Phoenix?  I want to interview
               everyone separately... and I felt we'd
               start with you and me.

     Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.

                         RUSSELL
               Absolutely.

     Russell turns away.  The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle,
     babbling on.

                         WILLIAM
               Because I've got a thing in a couple
               days.

                         RUSSELL
               What.

                         WILLIAM
                    (self-conscious)
               It's a... thing where... uhm... you go
               there to graduate.  School.

                         RUSSELL
                    (sharply)
               I never graduated.  And look what
               happened.  You're here interviewing me.

     Good point.  Laughs from everybody listening nearby.  It's a
     good line.  William makes a quick jot in his notebook.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               No no no.  Don't put that in Rolling
               Stone.  My bio says I graduated.  We'll
               come up with something better later.
               Just enjoy the ride.

     Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away.
     Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while
     grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.

                         LARRY
               How did you know I was thirsty?

     He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is.  He nods
     thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all.  And then
     Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William.  He accepts
     it too, and starts back to his seat.  He's been blown off, and
     he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and
     whispers in his ear:

                         PENNY
               I may need to stay in your room tonight.
               Russell's in a bad mood.  He's very
               Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today.
               He's trying to write.

     William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his
     seat.  A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to
     Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another
     hill.

                         POLEXIA
                    (inhaling deeply)
               Want some?

                         WILLIAM
               No thanks.

     A wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face.  It
     surrounds him like a cloud.   The bus shudders, as Russell
     continues playing slide up ahead.

     57    INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    57

     Elaine sits in her living room, filled with her books.  Large
     Department store photos of her children on the wall.  She feels
     her own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number.

                         ELAINE
               Has William Miller arrived yet?  He
               hasn't.  Could you give him a message
               as soon as you see him? -

     58    INT. BUS -- NIGHT                                   58

     Several hours later on this ride.  Outside, night and desert.
     Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness
     of the bus.  The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta
     Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast.  Everybody is
     free and anonymous in the dark.  They sing at full-volume.
     William looks out the window in wonder.

                         ZEPPELIN/ALL
               "Way down inside... (woman)
               woman...  you need... "

     The ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page.

                         ZEPPELIN/ALL (cont'd)
               "Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve... "

     John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still
     singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William
     watches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously
     in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady
     his writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating
     along to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.

     59    INT. ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY -- NIGHT                    59

     All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack.  The hotel chairs
     are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging.
     Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk.   The
     sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick.  He
     is forever teaching others their jobs.

                         DICK
               Jeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys...
               room list...
                    (re: luggage, to hotel
               bellman)
               If it doesn't have a number on it, it
               ain't ours!

     He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to
     William who he makes feel more important.  Penny is nearby with
     her suitcase and tackle box purse.  William watches Russell's
     guitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               The Enemy!  Here you go, here's the key to
               your palatial suite, room list, plus let me
               give you a luggage tag.  You're Number 42.

                         CLERK
               Is this Mr. Miller?  You have a message
               from Elaine.

                         WILLIAM
               Thanks.

                         CLERK
                    (confidentially)
               She's a handful.

                         WILLIAM
               I know.

     William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it,
     and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen.
     Jeff exchanges a look with Russell.  Nearby, the walking
     commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby.  It's Sapphire.
     Last night's clothes are now today's.  She holds a travel case,
     and hanger with some odd blouses.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Finally, you're here!!  They kicked me
               out of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!

     She hugs Penny Lane.  Estrella appears, happy to have help
     with Sapphire.

     ON RUSSELL

     who approaches William.

                         RUSSELL
               Come by in a few minutes.  We'll do
               the interview.

     The kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting
     Sapphire.  Russell looks through his messages.  The guitar,
     now in a case, never leaves his hand.  Jeff Bebe approaches,
     regarding William standing with Penny and the girls.  Intrigue
     is swirling in the lobby.

                         JEFF
               I'm worried, man.

                         RUSSELL
               Naw, we can trust him.  He's a fan.

                         JEFF
               But it's Rolling Stone.  He looks
               harmless, but he does represent the
               magazine that trashed Eric Clapton,
               broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin,
               and wrote that lame story about the
               Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane
               out before he died.  Don't forget the
               Rules.  This little shit is the Enemy.
               He writes what he sees.
                    (beat)
               But it would be cool to be on the cover.

                         RUSSELL
               Leave it to me.  We'll get a good story.

                         JEFF
               Plus our girlfriends read this magazine
               and -
                    (looking at Band-aids)
               -- you know.

                         RUSSELL
               You made your point.  I'll take to
               him.

     ON WILLIAM BY ELEVATOR

     Penny speaks confidentially to him.  If she is slightly bossy,
     it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and
     otherwise.

                         PENNY
               Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight?
               She had a big fight with Ozzy, and
               Polexia's not working out with Jeff
               Bebe.
                    (to Sapphire and Polexia)
               You just have to remember... these
               guys are jealous, insecure, talented,
               egocentric, and manipulative geniuses...
               they're lead-singers.   They can say
               "I love you" to 20,000 people... but
               any fewer is a real problem.
                    (girls nod, comforted, she
               continues to the kid)
               Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over
               Russell that he can't express.  Plus,
               he never slept last night.   You keep
               Sapphire and I'll stay with Russell.

     William covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a
     roommate.  Cooly:

                         WILLIAM
               Sure.  I'll take her.

                         POLEXIA
               Me too?

                         WILLIAM
               Sure.

     Estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking
     hopeful.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               If there's room -

     Penny squeezes him.  He feels cool... but the girl he really
     wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing
     into the elevator.  He looks down at the message in his hand,
     and opens it.

     It reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS!  He snaps it closed quickly, before
     anyone can see.

     59A   IN. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT                              59A

     Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap.
     Trying to write.  It's coming slowly.  Shot moves off him,
     past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and
     intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird.
     He looks over at her - she turns away quickly.  He goes back
     to work.  Tries to catch her watching him again.  She turns
     away just in time.

     60    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                    60

     Stillwater's "Fever Dog" plays from the t.v. radio.   William
     on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap.  His hotel
     room.  He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the
     ritual of inhabiting a room on the road.  Sapphire flutters a
     paisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along
     the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-
     many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has
     joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.
     Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this,
     the smallest room in the hotel.   William thumbs through the
     phone book with fascination.

                         WILLIAM
               All these people.
                    (wondrous, off phone book)
               And they all live in Phoenix.

                         POLEXIA
                    (on phone)
               Hi Dad!!  I can't talk long!  I'm here in
               Paris.  I'm staying in another Youth Hostel
               with no phone and no address for mail!!

                         WILLIAM
               (still wondrous, from phone
                book)
               Alex.  Lowbatz.

                         SAPPHIRE
                    (emerging from bathroom)
               I was the one who told him what to
               tattoo on his fingers, I was the one
               who made his shirts... I was there
               when his wife left him.

                         WILLIAM
               Charles.  C.  Swoop.

                         POLEXIA
                    (on phone)
               I CAN SEE THE EIFFELL TOWER.  DO YOU
               KNOW THERE ARE 578 STEPS TO THE TOP?

     She's reading from a European tour book.

                         WILLIAM
               Paul and Debbie Finger.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (looking out window)
               Oh my God.  Simon Kirke of Bad Company
               is by the pool.

     The girls mobilize by the window.  William is increasingly
     aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room.  He tries
     to organize his stuff in the corner.

                         POLEXIA
               I GOTTA GO!  I'LL CALL FROM ROME!

                         ESTRELLA
               Is anybody here as worried about Penny
               and Russell as I am?

                         POLEXIA
                    (the perfect daughter)
               AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MAGGIE!!
               I LOVE YOU!!

     She winks at William, who looks away.

                         SAPPHIRE
                    (to Polexia and William)
               Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at
               when you say that - that's who you
               really mean.

     Polexia hands up and throws a pillow at Sapphire,  the kid
     watches these girls like a tennis match.

     60A   IN. PENNY AND RUSSELL'S ROOM - SAME TIME                    60A

     Russell puts down his guitar.

                         RUSSELL
               You know.  We should talk about what
               we don't talk about.

                         PENNY
               We don't have to.

                         RUSSELL
               No, I - I went to Catholic school.  I
               believe in guilt and... you know, if
               there's any to be had, I pretty much
               want to roll around in it.

                         PENNY
               I don't believe in attachments.  No
               boundaries.  Just the music.

                         RUSSELL
               I'm just saying, it's okay to talk
               about it.

     Penny stands and turns.  She speaks the word.

                         PENNY
               Leslie.

     Russell nods.  The name is out in the open.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
               Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
               Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.

                         RUSSELL
                    (somehow satisfied)
               Alright - now we're talking.

     But she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different
     ways, in different accents, and with different degrees of
     indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-
     drama.

     PUSH IN ON HIS FACE

     As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning.
     Is she mocking him?   In love with him?  Taunting him?  Seducing
     him?

                         PENNY
               Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie.
               Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
               Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
               LESlie.  Leslie...

     She continues saying it until it no longer has meaning.  And
     finally she sits next to him.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
                    (beat)
               Now.  Have I helped you get that off
               your chest?

     They kiss.

     60B   INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME                    60B

     The girls continue their settling-in process.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Opie, can I order room service?

     The nickname "Opie" re-opens a nagging wound.  Polexia hangs
     up, and begins to dial again.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.  You guys.  Wait.   Put down the
               phone, Polexia.
                    (she does, sadly)
               First, this is my room...

                         SAPPHIRE
               Come on, you're a fan like us.  You're
               on our side of the line.

                         WILLIAM
               Second.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie
               is a little boy.  I'm here to do a
               job.  I am a professional.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (flipping luggage tag)
               Ooooooo, sorry, Mr. 42.

                         WILLIAM
               Third!
                    (has their attention now)
               ... this phone is a big, big deal.  In
               a minute, I have to go interview
               Russell.  Do not answer this phone if it
               rings.  I have family members with
               severe anxiety Problems.  She will not
               understand.

                         POLEXIA
                    (wounded)
               But what if Ozzy calls Sapphire?   And
               I gave Jimmy Page this number.

                         ESTRELLA
               Or a guy who looked like Jimmy Page.

     William looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing
     and too much make-up.

                         WILLIAM
               Okay.   I have a solution.  Answer the
               phone.  But if anyone without an English
               accent is on the phone...
                    (winging it)
               Just hang up.  Or say it's the wrong
               room.

     They nod.  It's a good plan.

     61    EXT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT                               61

     The hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William
     knocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with
     her cart, which now blocks the hallway.

                         WILLIAM
               SHOULD I COME BY LATER?

     A group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid
     cart.  They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell
     through the door.

                         RUSSELL (O.S.)
                YES, I'M IN TOO TRUTHFUL A MOOD!

                         WILLIAM
               MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING!!

                         RUSSELL (O.S.)
               I'LL SEE YOU AT THE RADIO INTERVIEW
               LATER!!  TEN-THIRTY IN THE LOBBY.

                         WILLIAM
               OKAY!

                         RUSSELL
               GO AWAY!

                         WILLIAM
               OKAY!

     We hear Penny's giggle.  Then the door opens, and it's Penny
     looking ravishing.  In the background, Russell sits shirtless
     at the table.  He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up
     wads of hotel stationery.

                         PENNY
               Don't worry.  Some to the radio
               interview.

                         WILLIAM
               No, I'm fine.  I'll just interview
               Jeff Bebe some more.

                         RUSSELL
                    (as in "you're on of us")
               GO AWAY!

     She shuts the door quickly.  It hurts a little.  He picks up
     the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He
     leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
     matches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to
     Russell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds
     of laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign

     62    INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT                         62

     Humble Pie.  "Thirty Days in the Hole."  Russell and band enter
     the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.
     As always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.
     Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,
     as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold
     records  and head down the small hallway to the control room
     interview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
     green coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a
     little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
     have none of it.  She privately shares every great passing
     moment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.
     It's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."

     63    INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT                         63

     Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone
     in this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff
     Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be
     just as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches
     all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.
     Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE
     ALLEN, 25.

     Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.
     The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
     ready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny
     Lane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely
     looks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,
     notices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the
     microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending.

                         QUINCE ALLEN
               The guitar of Russell Hammond.   "Fever
               Dog"...  The band is Stillwater.
                    (beat)
               Watch with your mind as they
               materialize.

     Band members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak.
     Quince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the
     music as the song plays out.

     64    INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                              64

     The phone rings.  Estrella answers.

                         ESTRELLA
               William's room.

     INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Ben Fong-Torres is calling from Rolling Stone.

                         BEN
               Can I please speak to him?  This is
               Ben Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone.

     Estrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just
     caught fire.

                         ESTRELLA
               I think I just messed up!

     65    INT. RADIO STATION -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME                    65

     Quince raises his head and continues on-the-air.  The same
     song is still ending.

                         QUINCE
               Look at the dogs, wearing the funny
               hats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks
               and family...

     Penny shoots William a look.   Do you believe this guy?

                         QUINCE (cont'd)
               It's Quince, with Stillwater.  Here.
               Live.  It's the Night Circus.

     The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk.  Quince
     continues, looking meaningfully at the band.  They are
     waiting... eager for a chance to speak.

                         QUINCE (cont'd)
               Every minute a baby is born somewhere..
               Life.  Death.  Hermetically sealed
               bags of human emotion.  Bags of love...
               bags of kindness?
                    (suddenly, turns)
               How'd you get together?

     As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens...
     feels... the words of his guests.

                         JEFF
               Well... not to get into a "me" thing...
               this is Jeff talking... but I did start
               the band, some time, actually, ago.
               This is back when we were the Jeff
               Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a
               magazine called Peaches looking for a
               guitarist and Russell Hammond answered.

     Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.

                         QUINCE
                    (with deep understanding)
               Peaches.

     Jeff watches Quince's head lower.  It's hard to know when to
     talk with Quince.  The depth of his mellowness is tough to get
     in rhythm with.

                         JEFF
               I think he was a gift from God,
               actually.  Nobody plays like Russell
               Hammond.

                         RUSSELL
                    (sorta moved)
               Well, shit.  Thank you.

     He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Ooops.  Better hit the delay button.

     All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to
     some inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each
     other.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be
     asleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with
     Penny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward
     and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Okay - we're talking now, right?  Why
               the fuck do you wait until and interview
               in Arizona to say something nice about
               me.  Why don't you say it to my fucking
               face sometime?  Because I tell you
               every time I think you nailed something.

                         JEFF
               Everybody pays you compliments.  It's
               not my fucking job to kiss your fucking
               ass all the time.

                         RUSSELL
               Well then who's fucking job is it?
               Because my ass is dying for a kiss.
               And I know yours is too.

                         DICK
               It's my fucking job.  You're all
               geniuses.  And let me just add this
               thought - smegma.

     Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William.
     He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room.
     William shares a look.  Quince is still deeply asleep, as the
     usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.

                         TONY
               Feces.

     He cracks himself up, silently.  Quince snaps awake, fully in-
     stride.

                         QUINCE
               The dong is called "Love Thing." Your
               mind is Starting to take effect.
               They're all here to see you swallow
               fire.  You scream soundlessly...  on the
               Night Circus.  It's Quince, with
               Stillwater.

     "Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.

                         QUINCE (cont'd)
               I thought that went well.

     66    INT. RENTAL CAR -- NIGHT                               66

     Adrenalized laughter.  The whole band is crammed into a medium-
     sized rental car.  Penny half on William's lap, half on
     Russell's.

                         RUSSELL
                    (to William)
               See, this is what nobody writes about!
               The in-between times!   This!  Us!
               Right now!!

     67    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM                              67

     The phone is ringing.  Estrella emerges from the bathroom with
     no make-up and a t-shirt.  She picks up the phone.  Across the
     room, Sapphire signs for room service.  Now she is far too
     made-up.  The t.v. radio plays Free's "Fire and Water" in the
     b.g.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (suspiciously)
               Hello?

                                         INTERCUT:

     INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     It's Mom on the phone.

                         ELAINE
                    (measured, very proper)
               May I speak with William please?

                         ESTRELLA
                    (cheerfully)
               He's not here.  I think he's in the
               bar with the Band.  They just got back
               from the radio station.  Is this Maryann
               with the pot?

     Silence.

                         ESTRELLA (cont'd)
               Hello?

                         ELAINE
               No this isn't Maryann with the pot.
               This is Elaine... his Mother.

     Estrella physically recoils.

                         ESTRELLA
                    (cringing)
               I thought you were English.

                         ELAINE
               Could you please give him a message?
               Could you tell him to call home
               immediately?  And could you also tell
               him -
                    (at full power)
               I know what's going on.

                         ESTRELLA
               Alright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to
               say this, and I'm going to stand by
               it.
                    (can't help herself)
               You should be really proud of him.
               'Cause I know guys... and I'll bet you
               do too.  And he respects women, and he
               likes women, and let's just pause and
               appreciate a man like that.   You
               created him out of thin air, and you
               raised him right, and we're all looking
               out for him.  And that's more than
               I've ever said to my own parents, so
               there you go.
                    (silence)
               This is the maid speaking, by the way.

     68    INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT                              68

     Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in
     the hotel lobby.  William shuffles through many pages of
     questions written in small script.  His tape recorder microphone
     sits balanced on the chair.

                         WILLIAM
                    (very professional)
               Now that you're starting to be
               successful, you had twenty-six years
               to write your first Album... and you'll
               have maybe four months for the second.
               Do you worry that the pressure of the
               business will get in the way of the
               original joy of making your music?  Or
               -

     Russell blinks.  The all-consuming issues of his life are right
     in front of him.

                         RUSSELL
               Whoa!
                    (laughing)
               I need three more beers and my guitar
               before I can answer that question.
               Let's take a walk.

     69    EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT                         69

     Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William.
     William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room,
     facing the pool.  Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a
     moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait
     twenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours
     pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.
     Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.
     Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels
     from a maid cart.  And she is the first to slip into the pool
     for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming.  Effortlessly,
     she turns a collection of people into a party.  They regard
     her, well out of earshot of the others.

                         RUSSELL
               For a minute I thought you were actually
               a real journalist... which is... you
               know, it's great.
                    (beat)
               Shut that thing off, and I'll tell you
               the truth.

     William shuts his tape recorder off.

                         WILLIAM
               It's off.

                         RUSSELL
               Look.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay
               this right on you.  Just make us look
               cool.

                         WILLIAM
               I will quote you warmly and accurately.

                         RUSSELL
               That's what I'm worried about.  See -
               some of us have girlfriends back home.
               Some of us have wives.  And... some of
               the people you meet on the road are
               really amazing people...

     They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool.
     She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting
     all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Like you.  And some of the things that
               happen are good for just a few people
               to know about - as opposed to, say, a
               million people.

     Dawn is breaking for William.

                         WILLIAM
               Ohhhh.  Oh.  Yeah.

                         RUSSELL
               You know what I mean?

                         WILLIAM
               Right.  Yeah.

                         RUSSELL
               See, you're dangerous.  Most people
               are just waiting to talk, but you
               listen.

                         WILLIAM
               Right.  Right.

                         RUSSELL
               So your question you asked me.  I think
               about It every fucking night.  The
               "business."  I hate it!
                    (quietly)
               I grew up with these guys, okay?  I
               can't play all that I can play, I'm
               past these musicians, do you understand?

                         WILLIAM
               I do.

                         RUSSELL
               The more popular we get, the more I
               can't walk on them, the bigger their
               houses get, the more pressure... you
               forget, man.  You forget what it was
               like to be real, to be a fan.  You can
               hear it in a lot of bands who've been
               successful - it doesn't sound like
               music anymore.  It sounds like...
               like lifestyle maintenance.
                    (suddenly confessional)
               I used to be able to hear the sounds
               of the world.  Everything, to me, used
               to sound like music.  Everything.  Now
               I don't hear it.   You know what I'm
               trying to say?

                         WILLIAM
                    (ruefully)
               Yeah.

                         RUSSELL
               Man, it feels good to say this stuff
               out loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm
               telling secrets to the one guy you
               don't tell secrets to.

                         WILLIAM
                    (feeling included)
               No, that's okay.  We'll do the interview
               tomorrow.

                         RUSSELL
               This is good.  So there's the "friend"
               and then there's the "interview guy."

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.

                         RUSSELL
               So tonight it's "friend".... and when
               we wake up tomorrow - "interview guy."
               We'll figure it out as we go, buddy.

                         WILLIAM
               Hey - for whatever it's worth - you
               guys are really good.

     Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar
     to the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the
     crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't
     care.  Penny gestures for him to join them.

     70    EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON                         70

     William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On
     stage, Ed soundchecks his drums.

                         WILLIAM
               How would you describe your role in
               Stillwater?  What is the chemical that
               you add to the chemistry?

                         LARRY
               I'm the bass-player.

                         WILLIAM
                    (pressing for some poetry)
               Right.  And when you take that away...
               what would be missing?  Stylistically?
               What chemical?

                         LARRY
                    (not getting it)
               The bass?

     Larry doesn't give him much.

     71    EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHT                               71

     It's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part
     of them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf
     from around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks
     instantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick
     takes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.
     In his important voice:

                         DICK
               Good evening Phoenix.
                    (applause)
               From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,
               Stillwater.

     Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog."   Jeff
     begins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
     a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.

     A sharp electrical shock.

     It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a
     moment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the
     microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage
     for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal.  His
     face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,
     collapsing a couple steps later.

     72    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT                              72

     Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has
     been pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging
     Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.

                         DICK
               Get in, get in!!

     William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
     arrives to confront Dick.

                         PROMOTER
               Are you the manager of this band?

                         DICK
               That, and more.  Get in!

                         PROMOTER
               You didn't even play a full set!

     Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing
     with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.

                         DICK
               Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed
               our guitarist!

                         PROMOTER
               You trashed the dressing room - you
               didn't play your thirty-five minutes.
               You didn't fulfill your contract -

                         DICK
               Everybody in!  Get in the bus!

                         PROMOTER
               I'll report you to every promoter in
               the country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank
               Barcelona!

                         DICK
               YOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!

                         PROMOTER
               I hope you have a good lawyer.

                         DICK
               I AM A LAWYER!

     He swings into the bus, as the bus revs.

                         PROMOTER
               LOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!

     73    INT. BUS -- NIGHT                                   73

     Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He
     examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the
     positivity of her words.

                         PENNY
               Don't worry.  It's happened to all the
               greats.  Thank God you didn't hold the
               mike stand with both hands, you'd still
               be holding it.  This is a good thing.
               It's a good, good, good thing.

     William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-
     sight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes
     to see that he's writing in his notebook.

     Dick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door
     shuts, as the promoter is still yelling.

     Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running
     alongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.

                         ESTRELLA
               I forgot to tell you!  Your mom says
               to call home immediately.  She says
               she knows what's going on!
                    (receding)
               See you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a
               ride with Sabbath!

     William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races
     toward the now closing gate.

                         DICK
                    (casually, to Russell)
               Wanna buy a gate?

     Before Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the
     steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
     this bus.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               You just bought a gate.
                    (to the bus)
               C'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!

     The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for
     Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
     thoroughfare.

                         WILLIAM
               What did it feel like to be
               electrocuted?

                         RUSSELL
               It burns.  It feels like a dose of
               lead shooting through your body... and
               then you see God, and he says, "How
               bad do you want to be legendary?" And
               god damnit.  I let go.
                    (shaky grin as all laugh
               warmly)
               Rock and roll.

     Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid
     scribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the
     Way."

     74    INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING                              74

     Song continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes
     the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes
     up.

                         PENNY
               Give that to me.

     She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some
     other Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of
     the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the
     passing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music
     continues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a
     long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
     for a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,
     waves briefly to the real world.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
                    (breathing heavy, owning
               the world)
               When we go to Morocco, I think we should
               wear completely different clothes, and
               be completely different people.

                         WILLIAM
               What will our names be?

     She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets
     the Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.
     Her attention has already wandered from Morocco.

                         PENNY
               What do you think of Russell?

                         WILLIAM
               I like him.

                         PENNY
               You're coming to Cleveland, right?

                         WILLIAM
               Cleveland, Ohio?  Oh no no no.  I gotta
               get my interview with Russell before
               Greenville.  And you've got to help
               me.  Okay?  Friends... remember?

     Penny is still watching Russell.

                         PENNY
               You should give him a break.  There
               are real problems in the band.   Off
               the record.

     Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in
     watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping
     restlessly up ahead.

                         WILLIAM
               What problems?

                         PENNY
               Okay.  I got it.  I think your name
               should be Spencer, and mine will be
               Jane.

                         WILLIAM
               I can't keep up with you.

                         PENNY
               No one can.

                         WILLIAM
               What's your real name?

     She looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's
     intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her
     free hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell
     sleeping nearby:

                         PENNY
               Here's the thing about Russell.  He's
               my last project.  I only do this for a
               very few people.  And I think we should
               do it together - he is almost great.
               We've got to take him there.  You and
               me - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the
               other guys are good - but he could be
               great.  He's my last project.

     He looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
               It's all happening.

     75    INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT                    75

     William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.

                         WILLIAM
               What do you love about music?

     Ed looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He
     thinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.
     These interviews are not going well.

     76    INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                              76

     William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,
     walks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious
     notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
     there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
     by a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides
     the coke spoon.

                         JEFF
               Hey.

                         WILLIAM
               Hey.

     William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,
     and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little
     worried.

     77    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT                         77

     William is on the pay phone with his Mother.  The show booms
     in the background.

                         WILLIAM
               I know.  I know.  I know.
                    (beat)
               I know.  Mom.  Mom... Mom.

     78    INT. STAGE - NIGHT                              78

     Stillwater on-stage.  A great show.  Russell on fire.

     79    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT                         79

     William on the phone.  Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.

                         WILLIAM
               Right now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville.
               Then home.

     He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a
     moment.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               I'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!
               It's not like you can just carry a
               phone around with you.

     80    INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOON                    80

     Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home
     - a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is
     going down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.

                         ELAINE
               I guess I just miss you, and I don't
               understand why I've driven both my
               kids so far away from me.  By all
               practical rules don't I get you for
               three more years?

     He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,
     as music continues in b.g.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Was I not fun?

     81    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHT                         81

     William has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's
     set now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer
     this question.

                         WILLIAM
               I missed the last thing you said.

     Mom takes a pause.

                         ELAINE
               I LOVE YOU.

     Penny now enters, watching.

                         WILLIAM
               WHAT?

                         ELAINE
                    (angry, louder)
               I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!

     William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad
     from a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he
     believes is a private confession.

                         WILLIAM
               I LOVE YOU!!

     Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another
     backstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He
     is suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that
     he loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.

     82    INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT                    82

     Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.
     He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage
     for the next city is stacked by the door.

                         RUSSELL
               Fire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the
               "You" Train.  Take me there.

     The kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs
     his first question.

                         WILLIAM
               Do you have to be depressed to write a
               sad song?  Do you have to be in love
               to write a love song?  Is a song better
               if it really happened to you?  Like,
               "If You Say Nothing"... where did you
               write that and how did it come about?

     Russell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks
     at his hand, thinks.

                         RUSSELL
               When did you get so professional?

     In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.
     Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent
     drummer, waiting for his shirt.

                         PENNY
               I'm almost done with my shirt.

     Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber
     pad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In
     the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
     underappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
     box.

                         DICK
               Russell, your dad showed up again.
               And on a lighter note.
                    (importantly)
               Gentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have
               arrived.

     There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the
     box filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh
     shirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -
     their first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has
     been a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name
     emblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-
     in and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.
     Jeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is
     a long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               It's the record company's mistake.
               And they will pay.  Shirts gone, band
               happy.

     He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were
     contaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the
     two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.
     Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.
     Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him.

                         RUSSELL
               Can we just skip the vibe and go
               straight to us laughing about this?

                         JEFF
                    (bitterly)
               Yeah.  Okay.

                         RUSSELL
                    (trying for a joke)
               Because I can see by your face - you
               want to get into this -

                         JEFF
               How can you tell?  I'm just one of the
               out-of-focus guys.

                         RUSSELL
               Here we go.

     William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Here.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -
               it lets you say everything you want to
               say.

                         JEFF
               Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

                         RUSSELL
               It's a t-shirt.

     Russell turns away.

                         JEFF
               I'm always gonna tell you the truth.

                         RUSSELL
               Are you doing coke again?

                         JEFF
               Oh yeah.  All the time.

     The kid looks down.

                         JEFF (cont'd)
               This is big stuff, man.  From the very
               beginning -- we said -- I'm the front
               man and you're the guitarist with
               mystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed
               on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But
               somehow it's all turning around.  We
               have got to control what's happening
               to us.  There's a responsibility here -

                         RUSSELL
               Excuse me, but didn't we all get into
               this to avoid responsibility?

                         JEFF
               Forgive me.
                    (continuing, on shirt)
               But this is the slow-moving train of
               compromise that will kill us.

     Russell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,
     looking back at William.

                         JEFF (cont'd)
               I can't say anymore with a writer here.

                         RUSSELL
               You can trust him,  you can say whatever
               you want.

                         JEFF
                    (eyes suddenly moist)
               I works as hard or harder than anybody
               on that stage.  You know what I do - I
               connect.  I get people off.  I look
               for the guy who isn't getting off, and
               I make him get off.
                    (beat)
               Actually, that you can print.
                    (continues to Russell)
               And yet, why do I always end up feeling
               like I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing
               but love for you.  We're a family.

     He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he
     grows angrier.

                         JEFF (cont'd)
               You want to pretend this isn't going
               to be a very big band.  Well it is.  You
               call yourself a leader of this band, but
               your direction allowed the t-shirt, when
               you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause
               he's your friend... don't you see?  The
               t-shirt is everything.  It's everything.

                         RUSSELL
               Is it my turn?  Because I think we
               should, for once, say what we really
               mean.

                         JEFF
               Oh, this is the part where you quit -

                         RUSSELL
                    (stiffening)
               Right.  I'm so predictable.

                         JEFF
               No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want
               you to like me.  But sometimes I feel
               like you collect people who love you
               and then very skillfully... you make
               them feel bad that they're not good
               enough for you.

                         RUSSELL
               Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you
               ain't gonna make it as a shrink.

                         JEFF
               Deal with it!  And let me just say
               what nobody Else wants to say to you -

                         RUSSELL
               What?

                         JEFF
               Your looks have become a problem.

     82A   EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                               82A

     Russell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds
     court with beer in hand.  He dresses too young for his age,
     late fifties.  He is DAD.

                         DAD
               Son!

                         RUSSELL
                    (dutifully)
               Hello Harry.

     Dad introduces a woman much younger, who eyes Russell hungrily.

                         DAD
               He got all the good genes, huh?  Meet
               Deirdre.  We're getting married in
               July.

     83    EXT. ARENA -- NIGHT                              83

     Russell walks fast outside the arena.  William hustles to catch
     up.  The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night
     air, beyond the backstage area.  Fans begin to recognize and
     follow at a discreet distance.

                         WILLIAM
               You okay?  You alright?

     Russell doesn't answer.

                         RUSSELL
                    (resolute, wound up)
               From here on out, I'm only interested
               in what's real.

     The kid nods.  They walk.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Real feelings.  Real people.  That's
               all I'm interested in...  From here on
               out.  What is REAL?   You're real.

                         WILLIAM
               Thanks.

     A wave of warmth comes over Russell.

                         RUSSELL
               You know, you know all about us and I
               don't know shit about you.
                    (struggling to be personal)
               What's your... your family like?  Tell
               me.

                         WILLIAM
               Well, my dad died of a heart attack
               and my sister believes that my Mom is
               so intense that she might have
               contributed to it.  Plus -

                         RUSSELL
                    (immediately)
               Okay, that's good.  That's enough.

                         WILLIAM
               It's good to talk about it.  Really
               good.

     Russel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it
     makes him nervous.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               Hey, man, maybe we should go back.

                         RUSSELL
               If they want me, they can find me.

     William turns and sees nobody following but fans.

                         WILLIAM
               So listen.  I have to go home tomorrow.
               I know this is a bad time to finish
               our interview.

                         RUSSELL
               Hey, man, you know what?  Write whatever
               you want.  I trust you.

     A big square Chevy van slows down.  A CONCERT-GOER hands his
     head out the window.

                         CONCERT-GOER
                    (battle-cry)
               Woooooooooo!!!  You're Russel from
               Stillwater!!

                         RUSSELL
               On my better days, yes.  I am "Woooooo,
               Russell from Stillwater!"

                         CONCERT-GOER
               Wanna go to a party at my friend Aaron's
               house?!  I know you're a big rock star,
               but do you want to hang with some people
               looking to have a good time?

     Russel regards the van full of kids.  More fans crowding
     around.  The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic
     words.

                         CONCERT-GOER (cont'd)
               We're just real Topeka people, man.

     He has said the magic word.

     A84   EXT. AARON'S PARTY - NIGHT                         A84

     Russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of Topeka.
     William nearby.

     84    INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                         84

     William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle.
     They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old AARON.
     He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him.
     Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home.

                         RUSSELL
                    (eyes glowing)
               You.  Aaron.  Are what it's all about.
               You are real.  Your room is real.
               Your friends are real.  You are more
               important than... than... all the silly
               machinery.  And you know it!  In eleven
               years it's gonna be 1984, man.  Think
               about that!

                         AARON
               Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake?

                         RUSSELL
               Yes.

                         KID # 1
               Can I have your belt?

                         RUSSELL
               Take it!

     Russel whips off his belt, gives it to the fan.  A joint goes
     by, headed for Russell.  William intercepts it and passes it
     on.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Aaron?  Where's your bathroom?  I want
               to live here. I want to eat your food,
               and live in your city and fuckin rock
               like I used to.  I want to learn
               everything there is to know about your
               city and your town.  And your way of
               being real.
                    (stunning realization)
               I used to be you.

                         AARON
               Down the hall by the washing machine.

                         RUSSELL
               What?

                         AARON
               The bathroom.

                         RUSSELL
               Okay.  Good to know.

     Russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall.

     85    INT. AARON'S HALLWAY - NIGHT                         85

     William follows Russell protectively.

                         PASSING FAN # 1
               WOOOOOOO!!

     A QUIET GIRL, 14, turns and watches Russell pass.  We linger
     on her face for just a moment, full of wonder.

                         WILLIAM
               We should probably head back sometime.

     Russell ignores him.

                         PASSING FAN # 2
                    (holding red cup)
               Watch out, there's acid in the beer
               that's in the Red cups.

     Russell looks at the cup in his own hand.  It's white.  Then,
     with his other hand, he grabs the red cup and drains it.
     William winces.  They move on.

                         RUSSELL
               Topeka.  Check it out.

     Russell enters the bathroom.  William stands guard.  With a
     finger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing
     in the hallway.

                         WILLIAM
               Please don't give him any more acid.

     86    INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER               86

     William watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses
     now, goes through Aaron's record collection.  He places the
     albums over his face, like masks.

                         RUSSELL
               Faces.  Stones.  Sa-weet Baby James!!
               None of these people are gonna be around
               in twenty years!  Plastic begets
               plastic!!   Black plastic.

     Partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their
     living room.

                                         INTERCUT:

     87    INT. BACK BEDROOM -- NIGHT                         87

     William waits anxiously to use the phone, keeping an eye on
     Russell.  Russell is now strangely twisting/dancing with four
     girls in the living room, as more cars arrive outside.

                         KID ON PHONE
               He's here right now!  Go ahead and put
               it Out over the radio, tell people to
               bring food And beer and chicks.  We're
               at Rural Route # 4 -

                         WILLIAM
               No no.  Nope.  No.

     William takes the phone and hangs up.  Keeping an eye on Russell
     in the next room, he dials from a tour itinerary sheet.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               Dick Roswell, please?
                    (beat)
               Dick!!  I got him!!  He's okay... I've
               been Looking after him.  He's on acid,
               though.  I can't Really tell.  How do
               you know when it's "kicked in?"

     88    EXT. AARON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT                         88

     Russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop.
     The unlit, unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below.
     It's kicked in.

                         RUSSELL
                    (bellowing to the heavens)
               I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

     Russell cackles at the joke of it all.  William yells up from
     down below.

                         WILLIAM
               Hey Russell -

                         RUSSELL
               I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!

                         WILLIAM
               Don't jump, okay?

                         RUSSELL
               And you can tell Rolling Stone Magazine
               my last words were -

     He spreads his arms, and tries to think of last words.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               -- I'm on drugs!!

     The kids cheer.  William looks around, remains cool.  Yells
     upward in the cold night air.

                         WILLIAM
               I think we should work on those last
               words.

                         RUSSELL
               Critic!!

                         WILLIAM
               No, I'm not -

                         RUSSELL
               Okay I got it.  I got it.  I got it.
               I got it.   This is better.  Last words
               -
                    (spreads his arms, his
               greatest realization)
               I DIG MUSIC!!

     It gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
                    (immediately)
               I'm on drugs!!

     They applaud again.

                         WILLIAM
               Just come on down!!

                         RUSSELL
                    (matter-of-fact)
               Okay.

     He jumps from the roof into the cold, algaed water below.  He
     sinks immediately.  One kid jumps in, then another, then more.

     Everybody wants to save Russell.

     89    EXT. AARON'S NEIGHBORHOOD -- EARLY MORNING               89

     It's getting lighter.  Cars line the street.  And now, finally
     turning the corner, is Doris the Bus.

     90    INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING                              90

     William watches the effects of personal charisma.  Wet
     partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in
     hand,  wrapped in towels.  Now a bond has passes between them,
     all of them.  Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face
     and neck.

                         RUSSELL
               Thanks for saving my life.  I won't
               hold it against you.

     Twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity.  ("Glad
     to do it," "Right on," "Damn straight.")

     91    INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN -- MORNING                    91

     Door opens.  Dick enters.  Finding the guitarist in the kitchen,
     he clicks into time-tested road-managerial maintenance.  Easing
     Russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him,
     from Russell's hands.

                         DICK
                    (privately)
               They've been crying for you like a
               bunch of whimpering pussies --

                         RUSSELL
                    (woozy)
               The band is over.  This is my family
               now.

                         OTHERS
               Right on.  He's staying with us.

                         DICK
                    (soothing)
               Definitely.  It's all over.  We'll
               just ride on to Greenville, listen to
               some great music, finish the tour, and
               leave those ungrateful fools behind.
               And then we'll come back here, where
               you'll live.

                         RUSSELL
               I know what you're doing... and I like
               it.
                    (noticing William)
               Look at him.  He's taking notes with
               his eyes.
                    (beat, to Dick)
               How do we know he's not a cop?

     William laughs painfully, as Russell moves in, eyes flaring
     with sudden paranoia.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               He could be selling information!

                         DICK
                    (to Russell)
               Easy.  He's your Guardian Angel.

     Russell turns away.  William shrugs with style, but his
     lingering look is filled with hurt.  Dick guides Russell to
     the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as
     they move.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               Don't worry.  He only means half of
               what he says.

                         WILLIAM
               Which half?

                         DICK
               Good question.

                         WILLIAM
                    (very direct)
               I have a lot more.  Just help me get
               my interview so I can go home from
               Greenville.  I have to go home.
                    (pulls him back)
               I have to go home.

                         DICK
               Hey.  You saved the tour.   That's
               good enough for now.

     Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of
     Russell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes
     and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the
     partygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a
     pack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer."
     Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important"
     stage voice.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               Ladies and Gentlemen, the evening is
               over!  We hope you've enjoyed
               yourselves, and we'll See you again in
               1974!!  Good evening!!

     William gives Russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight.
     Russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers.  The Quiet
     Girl breaks free to catch Russell on the way out.

                         QUIET GIRL
               I'll never forget you.

     Dick pats William's arm one more time -- good work.  They leave
     Aaron's house as legends.

     92    INT. TOUR BUS -- MORNING - 5 AM                         92

     "Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo.  Russell sits up
     front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent.   The others
     have given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know
     it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel
     foolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four
     rows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,
     a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is
     only more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or
     two, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...
     waking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and
     starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.
     It's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is
     his family.

                                             FADE OUT

     FADE IN:

     93    EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY                              93

     Passing signs announce Greenville, North Carolina.

     94    INT. LESTER BANGS BEDROOM - DAY                         94

     Lester on the phone.  He is paler than ever, in a room clogged
     with vinyl, happily listening to the MC5 in the background.

                         LESTER
               How's it going?

                                         INTERCUT:

     95    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                         95

     It's a small wooden-walled hotel room in Greenville.  Polexia
     tries on clothes.  William barely notices as he talks to Lester
     on the phone.

                         WILLIAM
               Rolling Stone is calling me.  I don't
               have my key interview.  I don't know
               what to say.

                         LESTER BANGS
                    (pacing, assembling thoughts
               with his hands)
               You're flipping out.  That's good.
               Alright.  This is how you blow their
               minds.  He'll ask you - this is Ben
               Fong-Torres, right? - he'll ask you
               how the story's going.  Here's what
               you do - let's fry his mind.  Tell him
               "it's a think piece about a mid-level
               band struggling with their own
               limitations in the harsh face of
               stardom."  Ha ha!!  This is fun!

     William scrambles to make notes.

                         WILLIAM
                    (madly copying)
               ... think... piece...

     CLOSE ON WRITING

     Longhand small script on yellow legal tablets.

     96    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT                         96

     William sits in the tub, without water.  It's his makeshift
     office, he's surrounded with scraps of notepaper.  He writes
     savagely, and now, savagely throws it away.

     97    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT                         97

     In the bedroom, Sapphire, Polexia and Penny watch The Midnight
     Special.  Sapphire looks at a room service menu.

                         SAPPHIRE
               It says the food is hearty and
               adventurous.

                         POLEXIA
                    (yawns)
               Greenville.  I'm bored.

     Penny yawns too, it's catchy, and rises to visit the bathroom.

                         POLEXIA (cont'd)
               Hey let's deflower the kid.

     Now Sapphire yawns, looks in her purse.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Who his the quaaludes from me?

     98    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT                         98

     Penny enters to see William writing in the tub.  She sits on
     the toilet to pee.  Flustered:

                         WILLIAM
               Wait.  I'll leave.

     He gets up, knocking his carefully organized notes onto the
     floor.  He is brimming with things to say.  More than he is
     even able to communicate.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               You know, I think this is going
               backwards for me.

                         PENNY
               Backwards?

                         WILLIAM
                    (flustered)
               I don't know.  I just thought we could
               hang out, maybe do some stuff back
               home, regular stuff, get to know each
               other better... and then I'd see you
               pee.  I mean, that's the way I usually
               do it.

                         PENNY
               You're one of us.  It's no big deal.

                         WILLIAM
               I'm not one of you.

                         PENNY
               Oh!  If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's
               going to be there at Swingo's, the
               greatest hotel in America.  I'll
               introduce you to him, and his security
               guy Dennis.

     William stops at the door.

                         WILLIAM
               Don't you have any regular friends?

                         PENNY
               Famous people are just more interesting.

     He looks at her.  Even sitting on the can, she's elegant and
     totally focused on him.

                         WILLIAM
                    (carefully)
               Well, I would be worried that they
               were using me.  And not that anybody's
               using you, but -

     She swoons a little, touched and moved.

                         PENNY
               Boy, if this was the real world and
               some guy talked to me like that -

                         WILLIAM
               Let me finish.
                    (continuing)
               I'm not famous.... but you could always
               use me.   If anything happens.  And I
               would never use you.  Even if I got
               famous.  So you know, you always have
               that from me... in the real world.  If
               you ever have to go back there, for
               anything.

     She looks at him curiously, as the door blasts open.  Sapphire
     and Polexia head for William.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Your time has come.

                         WILLIAM
               Did he call?
                    (realizes their intention)
               What are you -- stop it -- we're talking
               here.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Pants him.  Opie must die.

     They swarm him, dragging him kicking into the bedroom.

     99    INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NIGHT                         99

     Steely Dan, looking pale and somehow snappy, perform "Do It
     Again" on The Midnight Special.  The girls force William onto
     the bed, and envelope him.  Their sexuality is fun, untroubled.
     Shot moves past bodies crossing frame, onto William's face.

     ANGLE ON PENNY

     Across room, sitting and watching.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Just relax.  Take a vacation from
               yourself.  Leave this to professionals.

     Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully.  William looks
     confused.  Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the TV,
     blows him a kiss.

     Penny's eyes.  Across the room.

     His eyes.

     His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but
     to him it's an embarrassingly  intense moment he shares only
     with Penny Lane -- across the room.  She turns away, smiling,
     disappears into the next room.

     ON STEELY DAN

     On the television.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     99A  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - HANDHELD          99A

     Post-sex pajama party.  Sapphire, Estrella, and Polexia girltalk
     about their first rock and roll conquests.  Penny is conspicuous
     by her absence.  William is under the sheets, listening, feeling
     different, now a man and somehow one of the girls too.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:

     100   INT. BEDROOOM -- NEXT MORNING                         100

     William is awake.  Sunlight floods in from the corners of the
     window-shades.  He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the
     night before... Sapphire and Polexia.  The phone rings, and
     Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep.  Lost in her
     dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever.

                         SAPPHIRE
                    (half-English accent)
               Hello.  Hi, Ben-Fong-Torres from Rolling
               Stone.

     William snatches the phone.

                         WILLIAM
                    (lowers voice)
               Hello.

     101   INT. BEN FONG-TORRES' KITCHEN -- SATURDAY MORNING               101

     Ben Fong-Torres is up bright and early.

                         BEN
               Hello William, this is your editor at --

     He offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies
     high-level importance.

                         BEN (cont'd)
               Rolling Stone.  How's the story?

     INT. GREENVILLE HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     William snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave
     importance.

                         WILLIAM
               I'm getting good stuff out here.

                         BEN
               Sounds like it.

     Next to him, Polexia yawns herself awake.

                         POLEXIA
               Man, I need some -

     He clamps a hand over her mouth.

                         BEN
                    (jocular but tough)
               Now listen.  Get it together.  We're
               both professionals, I don't have to
               tell you this.  You're not out there
               to join the party -- we already have
               one Hunter Thompson.  You're out there
               to interview and Report.  You got me?
               This isn't Creem Magazine, it's Rolling
               Stone.  We need this story in four
               days.  Now I want to know how it's
               shaping up.

                         WILLIAM
               It's a think-piece about a mid-level
               band grappling with their limitations
               in the face of the harsh glare of
               success.

                         BEN
                    (pause)
               I like what we're saying.  Let me try
               and get you a thousand more words.
               It's in consideration for the cover,
               but don't tell the band.

                         WILLIAM
                    (conflicted)
               Crazy.

     The kid hangs up, now shouldering even more pressure.  He
     unclamps Polexia's mouth.

                         POLEXIA
               - coffee.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Me too.  Greenville is so boring.
                    (to William)
               Any other city in the world and you'd
               still be a virgin.

                         WILLIAM
               I'm going out to find Russell.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Will you take the laundry?

                         WILLIAM
                    (to the girls)
               What am I to you?  Tell me right now!
               What. Am.  I.  To.  You.

     102   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY                              102

     Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes.  The orange bag
     strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry.  He
     consults room list.  A variety of noises and smells drift from
     the band rooms.  He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door,
     and it's Estrella who opens the door.  (Dick in the
     background.)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --
     as the door shuts.

                         WILLIAM
               Houdini... Houdini...

     He arrives at Russell's door.  Two exclamation points have
     been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign
     is gaffer-taped to his door.  He looks through the crack, at
     the bottom of the door.  Carefully and politely, he knocks.
     Instantly:

                         RUSSELL (O.S.)
               GO AWAY!

     Pissed, the kid flips off the door.  He sits down on a chair
     directly across from the room.  Push in on William, who is
     more pent-up than ever.  He tries hard not to cry, taking
     gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's
     failed.  He cries.

     FADE UP FROM DARKNESS

     A super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy
     face.  William's eyes open.  His own sleepy face is evident in
     Russell's sunglasses.  The bag of laundry is still at his feet.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               We'll do the interview in Cleveland!

                         WILLIAM
               No.  I can't.  You've got to help me.
               I have to go home.

                         RUSSELL
               Come on man, we'll have more time there.
               Don't be tense!!

     He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders.  He's waking up.  There's
     Penny, also rubbing his shoulders.  It is degrading... and
     somehow cool too.

                         WILLIAM
                    (to Penny)
               You said you'd help me.

                         PENNY
                    (massaging)
               Come to Cleveland.

                         RUSSELL
                    (massaging, hypnotically)
               Come to Cleveland... Come to
               Cleveland...

                         WILLIAM
               I can't!!

                         RUSSELL
               Can we help it if we like having you
               around!

     William is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now.  Embarrassed
     and frustrated.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Cleveland, my man.  You can't miss out
               on the Rock Mecca of the midwest -
               you're with us.  It's all happening!

                         PENNY
               Rock and roll!

                         WILLIAM
                    (weary)
               Rock and roll.

     We hear David Bowie's live version of "Waiting for the Man."

     103   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAY                              103

     They sit together, hair askew, in sunglasses, resting against
     the headboard.  Carefully, Russell identifies his thoughts.

                         RUSSELL
               I feel... like his parents.

     Penny runs a worried hand through her hair.

                         PENNY
               I know.

                         RUSSELL
               I wonder how that happened.

                         PENNY
               You ever notice that all our sentences
               begin with "I?"

                         RUSSELL
               I hadn't, no.

                         PENNY
               'Cause we should work on that.

     He looks at her, plays the guitar a little.

     104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                              104

     Night.  Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night.
     The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses
     of lives and people William will never meet.

     105   INT. WILLIAM'S BUS BUNK - NIGHT                         105

     William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow.
     Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the
     mattress above him, as music continues.

     William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the
     bunk above.  He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the
     front.  A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar.
     Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell
     sleeping.  The kid moves on.  He sits with the Bus Driver,
     whose CB crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to
     Cleveland.

     ON THE FIRST SIGN - LATE NIGHT

     Cleveland signs.  Music rises.  Heads pop awake.

                         RUSSELL
               Cleveland!

     106   EXT. DOWNTOWN CLEVELAND - LATE NIGHT                    106

     Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown
     Cleveland.  The streets are empty.  They pass the Agoura
     Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters
     Stillwater on the marquee.   Applause in the bus.

     107   INT. SWINGO'S CELEBRITY INN - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING          107

     Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack.  William sags
     with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder.  Here, in
     the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as
     promised.   The feeling of belonging invades all those in this
     lobby.  Fans and other touring rockers mingle together.
     Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work.

                         FAN
               It's Bowie!

     The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell.
     Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the
     elevators.  He is shrouded by a jacket.  Just the top of his
     electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security
     man Dennis in the elevator.  And out of the chaos comes...

     108   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY                              108

     Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's
     hotel room, making love.

     109   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY                              109

     Russell and Penny Lane smash against their own wall.

     109A  INT. ARENA - NIGHT                              109A

     Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans
     in the front row of this crowd.

     110   INT. BACKSTAGE CLEVELAND PAY PHONE - NIGHT               110

     A wild Cleveland crowd in the building.  The cities on this
     tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences.  And there
     is a whiff of business now too.  Men in satin tour jackets and
     some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage.  A Hysterical Fan
     is led screaming to the nearby medic room.  Few even react -
     it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning,
     on the backstage pay phone.  He is absolutely ready for the
     worst.

                         WILLIAM
               Hi Mom.  I'm in Cleveland.

     He listens stoically.  Larry and Ed watch nearby.

                                         INTERCUT:

     INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Moms sits in silence.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
                    (rehearsed)
               I'm fine! I'm fine!  I'm flying back on
               Monday Morning.  I'll only miss one
               test.  I'll make it up.

     Russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing.

                         RUSSELL
               Tell her you're a slave to the groove
               - you can't help it!

                         WILLIAM
                    (covers phone)
               No.

     Russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the
     other end.

                         RUSSELL
               Hi Mom!  It's Russell Hammond, I play
               guitar in Stillwater!   It's my fault.
               How does it feel to be the mother of
               the future of rock journalism?
                    (beat)
               Hello?

     Silence.   Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her
     pass.  They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew.
     They are more glam, more trashy and less selective.  They glare
     insolently at Penny Lane.  This is the future.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               You've got a great kid -- nothing to
               worry about!  We're taking care of
               him!  And you should come to a show
               sometime!  Join the Circus!

                         ELAINE
               Listen to me.   Your charm does not
               work on me.  I'm onto you.  Of course
               you like him.

                         RUSSELL
               Yes.

                         ELAINE
               He worships you people and that's fine
               with you, as long as he helps make you
               rich.

                         RUSSELL
                    (a nerve is struck)
               Rich?  I don't think so -

                         ELAINE
               Listen to me.  He's a smart, good-
               hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite
               potential.

     Russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes
     the truth.  He's 15?

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               This is not some apron-wearing mother
               you're talking to.  I know about your
               Valhalla of Decadence, and I shouldn't
               have let him go.  He is not ready for
               your world of compromised values, and
               diminished brain cells that you throw
               away like confetti.  Am I speaking
               clearly to you?

                         RUSSELL
               Yes, ma'am.

                         ELAINE
               If you break his spirit, harm him in
               any way, keep him from his chosen
               profession -- which is law, Something
               you may not value but I do -- you will
               meet the voice on the other end of
               this telephone.  And it will not be
               pretty.    Do we understand each other?

                         RUSSELL
               Yes... yes...

                         ELAINE
                    (always the teacher)
               I didn't ask for this role, but I'll
               play it.  Now go do your best.  "Be
               bold and mighty forces will come to
               your aide!"  Goethe said that.  It's
               not too late for you to be a person of
               substance.  Get my son home safely,
               I'm glad we spoke.

     She hangs up.  Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.

                         WILLIAM
               Some people get her.  Some don't.

     Russell is still recovering.  William feels embarrassed by his
     mother, once again.

     111   ON THE HUDDLE                                   111

     William with the band.  He yawns, as the band breaks.  Cleveland
     awaits.  We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage
     platform, still in darkness.  Already, stomping and applause
     is mounting.  Russell turns to William before taking the stage:

                         RUSSELL
               Your Mom kind of freaked me out.

                         WILLIAM
               She means well.

     Still rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled
     enthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette
     lighters stretch out before them.

                         DICK
                    (importantly)
               From Troy, Michigan...

     Russell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns
     to other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that
     everything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in
     darkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets
     all this play out before finally adding...

                         DICK (cont'd)
               Would you please welcome to Cleveland...

     More applause.  This is very very very very fun.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               Stillwater.

     Lights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right
     in the face, as they begin "Fever Dog."  The band charges
     headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out
     of the crowd and onto the stage.

     HANDHELD ON RUSSELL

     Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his
     guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
     into the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.
     More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and
     Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
     to Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment
     with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
     stage.

     112   INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT                         112

     William in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally
     interviewing Russell.  He holds the mike stoically.

                         WILLIAM
               So when you play a great show like
               tonight...

     Dick enters with great urgency.

                         DICK
               Okay.  I need everybody's attention.

     The kid shuts his eyes.  He knew this would happen.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               Alright, well, the rumors are true.
               The record company has sent a big-time
               manager here to try and talk you into
               replacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.
               I know you've all heard of him.  He's
               got all the big bands.  He's right
               outside.  He wants five minutes with
               you right now.  I think we gotta do
               it.

                         RUSSELL
                    (pissed)
               Then bring him in.

     William shuts off his tape recorder.

                         JEFF
                    (arrogant)
               Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a
               rail!

                         RUSSELL
                    (to William)
               We'll finish on the way to Boston.
               You can fly home from Boston.

     William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a
     small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed
     beard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton
     briefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,
     with a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his
     head are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket
     prices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and
     accounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (completely unthreatening)
               Hi.

                         RUSSELL
               We already have a manager.  He's been
               with us from the beginning.

     Hope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room
     with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.
     Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.

                         DENNIS HOPE
               Respectfully.  We all have our roots.
               I believe in bands holding onto their
               roots.  But those roots need to be
               augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth
               - I may enrage some and enthrall others.
               I don't really give a fuck.   Your
               manager here needs a manager.  Example.
               If you hadn't run out on the contract in
               Phoenix, you could have sued over
               Russell's hand... but you left, negating
               the contract, forfeiting the deposit,
               and you effectively traveled a long
               way to pay that promoter... to
               electrocute you.

     Russell looks at his hand.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               We can all work together.  Your damages
               have put you way into the hole for
               this tour.  Right now you owe the record
               company more than you've got.  But
               your record's selling, there's money
               to be made.  So I've brought a plane
               in, we can add more shows to make-up
               the difference.   Respectfully.

                         RUSSELL
                    (immediately)
               We travel by bus.

                         JEFF
               Doris is the soul of this band!  That
               bus has been our home since we were
               the Jeff Bebe Band.

     Dick watches his loyal band with admiration.

                         DENNIS
               Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick
               if I thought we'd make more money.
               You can play more dates with a plane...

     112A  INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT - SAME TIME                    112A

     Penny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena.  The roadies
     have packed up and moved on. She is alone in the poetic and
     trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with
     people.  (Behavior to come)

                                    INTERCUT WITH:

     112B  INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT                         112B

     The band meeting continues.

                         RUSSELL
                    (passionate)
               Hey man, it's not about the money!  It's
               about Playing music, and turning people
               on!

     The band agrees.

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (delicately)
               Yes, of course.  Clearly.
               Respectfully.   But on the distasteful
               subject of money.  Just know.  You're
               making it -- right now -- and it's all --

     He gestures to infinity.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               -- out there.  I'm just talking about
               bringing it --

     Bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to
     his heart.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               -- back here.

     The band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless.

                         DICK
               But why should we pay you for something
               we can do ourselves?

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (immediately)
               Do you know how to keep from getting
               charged for the ice below the
               floorboards of Chicago Stadium?
               Do you know how to do a headlining
               tour, do you Claire Rothman at the
               L.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan,
               Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank
               Barcelona?
                    (look around, amazed)
               This is Cleveland. Where's Kid Leo??
                    (basics)
               Do you know how you get a record not
               pressed but played?  Do you know?  I
               didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I
               just own the best umbrella.

     He laughs.  It's fun.  Band members are now listening, curiously
     spellbound.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               Because as much as you may believe that
               it will last forever, it does not last
               forever... your biggest fan right now
               soon they're going to go to college,
               gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money
               some other way, and you know what?
                    (the final insult)
               They'll tape your record from a friend's
               copy.

     Russell stops fingering his guitar.  Shot moves across the
     faces of the band members.  Pain.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               You've got to take what you can, when you
               can, while you can.  And you've got to do
               it now.  That's what the big boys do.

     The band squirms, but listens.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               Because if you think Mick Jagger will
               still be out there trying to be a rock
               star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly
               mistaken.

     Now he's reaching them.  Their slackened roar-weary faces stare
     back at the young dynamo.

                         DICK
                    (flustered)
               Yeah, well... we'll think about what
               you said.

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (casually)
               No no.  You don't understand.  I'll
               think about it.  I'm not auditioning.
               I came here to decide whether I want
               to represent you.  So I'll stand outside
               for a moment, and think about whether
               I want to stay.

     He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.
     William watches their body language.  No one wants to talk
     first.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can
     we talk him into staying?

     113   INT. PLANE -- DAY                                   113

     William watches as the band stands inside the new plane.  Dennis
     Hope looks on.

                         RUSSELL
               This is not us.   This is too much.

     He looks around for support.  Grim nodding faces.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
                    (impressed at seat)
               This is too much.

     William watches as Russell reclines.  Russell grabs Penny, and
     she falls into the seat next to him.   We hear the loud oncoming
     sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's
     seat.

                         DENNIS HOPE
               Do you mind?

     114   EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY                         114

     Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near
     a field.  The new plane lifts off in the background, as the
     bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears.  Bus Banner reads
     simply: CLEVELAND.  Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.

     115   INT. PLANE  NIGHT                                   115

     The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane,
     with William.

     116   INT. BOSTON HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -- DAY                    116

     William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,
     trolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on
     the walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign
     of the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a
     poker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick
     with exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,
     smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening
     not to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.

                         WILLIAM
               Anyone seen Russell?

                         DICK
               The Enemy!

     Door widens to reveal Russell.

                         RUSSELL
               Hey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker
               Party.  This game's been going of for
               two years.

                         DICK
               That's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's
               John - with J. Geils.  And that's
               Richard with the Eagles... and you know
               The Wheel.

                         THE WHEEL
               Hey.

     Grumbling roadies continue playing.  Like an old pro, the kid
     turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe.  This hand is down to Dick,
     and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.

                         DICK
               Side proposition.  For fifty dollars
               and a case of Heineken, I will put
               into the pot... three Lovely Ladies,
               Including the famous Penny Lane... the
               Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour
               before New York...

                         REG
               It's a deal.  Show 'em.

     Dick lays down three tens.  Reg lays down three Kings.  Dick
     loses.

                         DICK
               Three Lovely Ladies... now in the
               custody of Humble Pie.

                         REG
               Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars
               and a case of Heineken.

     Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face.  He leans over,
     and speaks confidentially to him.

                         RUSSELL
               Look.  Nobody's feelings are getting
               hurt here.  She already knows Leslie's
               coming To New York tomorrow.  They all
               understand.  This is the Circus.
               Everybody's trying not to go home.
               Nobody's saying goodbye.

                         WILLIAM
               No, I got it.

                         RUSSELL
               These are the Rules that come with
               every electric Guitar and every
               amplifier.  They're not just written
               anywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No
               attachments.  No boundaries.

     But the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Quit looking at me like that.

     116A  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              116A

     The kid is still stuck on the road.  He is in hell now.
     Wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes
     for a moment.  Another band is moving through.

                         SABBATH ROADIE
               Keep this hallway clear!

     117   INT. BACKSTAGE TRAILER/DRESSING ROOM -- AFTERNOON               117

     William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room
     bench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,
     guitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage
     headed for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens
     and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
     sparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable
     Penny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the
     cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.

                         DICK
               Happy Birthday from us.

     William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake.
     It hasn't sunk in yet.

     Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery.  He reads a poem.

                         RUSSELL
               So Penny our friend has gained another year.
               But long ago, she threw it in gear.
               She rocked the south
               The East and West.
               Could you please get off this endless tour
               Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking
                special guest?

     Laughter.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               She says she's retired
               Though we've heard that before.
               She chose us...
               And in Penny Lane we trust
               She is a fan of this band.
               Much more so than us.

     William watches her face.  Still enchanted, she hands out slices
     of the cake.

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (to the point)
               Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

     It hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful
     face does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the
     others -- the plane isn't bigger?  Shot moves in on Penny as
     she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging
     for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
     laughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to
     connect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody
     maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't
     look at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn
     Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.
     Russell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the
     luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.

     118   EXT. CONCORD PAVILLION BACKSTAGE -- EARLY MORNING               118

     William exits a backstage Portosan.  Penny catches him by the
     grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event.
     Their laminated passes swing from around their necks.  Thuding
     in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd.
     The sound of summer insects in the air.

                         PENNY
               So it wasn't a birthday party, it was
               a farewell.

     William doesn't answer.  He looks at her, blowing some hair
     out of her face.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
               You think you can fool me.  I read
               you.  I know what you're thinking.

                         WILLIAM
               What's that?

                         PENNY
                    (touched)
               You're worried about me and Russell.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.  I gotta work on that.

                         PENNY
               You're so sweet.  God -- if there was
               more of you in him...

                         WILLIAM
               Don't tell me this stuff.  I want to
               like him.

                         PENNY
                    (concerned for him)
               Did you miss your test or something?

     He shakes his head.  It's so beyond a test.

                         PENNY (cont'd)
               I know I'm not on the plane, and I'm
               not going on some other band's bus.  I
               mean, I could go with the Sabbath road
               crew, but that would be pathetic.  The
               girls are all going with Humble Pie.
               If you could find out from Russell --

                         WILLIAM
                    (quietly)
               Penny -

                         PENNY
                    (a decision)
               Forget it.  I'm flying to New York
               myself.  I have a bunch of partial
               tickets.  I know his ex-wife, current
               girlfriend's going to be there -

     William's eyebrows rise.  She examines his face for clues.

                         WILLIAM
               -- I'm not sure that's a good idea.

                         PENNY
                    (overlapping)
               What?  What are you saying?  What do
               you know?  Did Russell say something?

                         WILLIAM
               I don't know anything.

                         PENNY
               I know he wants me there.  He gave me
               a cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.

                         WILLIAM
                    (loud)
               Wake up!  Don't go to New York!

                         PENNY
               What are you telling me?

     She looks so achingly beautiful to him.

                         WILLIAM
               Because you're not who you said you
               were!  I thought you were retired!

                         PENNY
               You're right.  I'm not who I said I
               was.  I'm just like you. I love music,
               so this is my family.  Some people
               like tractors, and they hang out with
               tractor people.  What's the worst that
               could happen if I go to New York?
                    (little girl)
               "I get my little heart broken?"

                         WILLIAM
               Oh no.  Never you!  You eat people
               alive!

     She tears some leaves off a tree.  He looks at her, unable to
     formulate a response.

                         PENNY
                    (accusatory)
               I'm sorry I told you so much.   You
               have some way of making everybody tell
               you all their secrets.

                         WILLIAM
               That's a good one.  Tell me too much
               and make it my fault.

     He continues walking, she follows.  They have ventured outside
     the backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland.  The show
     booms in the background.

                         PENNY
               Come on.  You've seen what's happened.
               Russell and I fell in love.  How much,
               I don't know... but this is the first
               time I've fallen for someone, really
               fallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy
               about it.

                         WILLIAM
                    (beat)
               You slept with Iggy Pop!?

     She says nothing.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
                    (sputtering)
               Why don't you just tell me now, who
               else -- so when I go to the record
               store, I know who to be jealous of.
               Because right now, it's looking like
               the whole store!

     He's upset.   She stares at him.

                         PENNY
                    (teasing, defiant)
               You'll remember me forever.  I was
               there when you lost your virginity.

                         WILLIAM
                    (upset at the memory)
               So was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded
               room.

     She laughs, can't help it.  Then:

                         PENNY
               You make me laugh.  I think I'm gonna
               cry.

                         WILLIAM
                    (continuing)
               I thought we were going to Morocco!
               There's no Morocco.  There's never been
               a Morocco.  There's not even a Penny
               Lane.  I don'teven know your real
               name.

                         PENNY
               If I ever met a guy in the real world,
               who looked at me the way you just looked
               at me...

                         WILLIAM
               When and where does the real world
               occur?  I am really... confused here.
               Fuck!  All these Rules And all these
               sayings... and nicknames...

                         PENNY
               You know -- you're too sweet for rock
               and roll.

                         WILLIAM
               Where do you get off... where do you
               get "sweet?"  I'm not sweet.  I'm dark
               and mysterious and pissed-off and I
               could be very dangerous to all of you...
               I'm not sweet, and you should know
               that about me!  I am The Enemy.

                         PENNY
               You're not any of those things and
               that's what I love about you.

     William stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her.

                         WILLIAM
               You fall in love to keep from falling
               in love.

                         PENNY
               I don't want to go home!

                         WILLIAM
               Well, I have to go home.  And you never
               helped me.

                         PENNY
               Yes I did.

                         WILLIAM
               That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better
               interview than me... and he was asleep.

     He starts walking back to the stage.  She follows.  They are
     two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll.
     His frustration increases.  She just doesn't get it.  Applause
     in b.g.  She grabs his shirt.

                         PENNY
               Look.  You should be happy for me.
               You don't know what he says to me in
               private.  Maybe it is love.  As much
               as it can be with someone who --

                         WILLIAM
                    (blurts)
               -- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty
               dollars and a case of beer?  I was
               there!

     He is instantly sorry.  Her world privately crumbles, but she
     tries to remain stoic and carefree.

                         PENNY
               What kind of beer?

     119   INT. HUMBLE PIE CREW TRUCK -- DAY                         119

     Sapphire, Polexia, and Estrella bump along to the music and
     the road.  They strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly
     third-class surroundings.  There's only one small blurry window.

                         POLEXIA
               Who did this to us?

     120   INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT                    120

     Mom on the phone.

                         ELAINE
               Then don't come home.  Don't do this
               to me.  If you're going to miss
               graduation, don't come home.

     She hangs up.

     121   INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- NIGHT                         121

     William on the phone.   Speechless.

     122   INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM -- DAY                         122

     Elaine faces her Humanities class.  She stands in an
     amphitheater-style, inner-city college classroom, decorated
     with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home.  These earnest
     city college students listen to her.  But she cannot continue.
     There is a thundering upset inside her.

                         ELAINE
               I'm sorry.  I can't concentrate.
                    (beat, confesses, unhinged)
               Rock stars kidnaped my son.

     123   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY                              123

     Music.  Russell and band bounces down in NYC.  Russell listens
     to music on headphones plugged into large boom box.

     124   INT. LIMOUSINE -- DAY                              124

     William watches, facing the band from the jump seat of their
     limousine, heading into New York.  Up ahead, Manhattan looms,
     beautiful and scary.

                         RUSSELL
               "New York.  Just like I pictured it...
               "

                         JEFF
               " ... skyscrapers and everything."

                         RUSSELL
                    (to William)
               We showed you America.  We did
               everything but get you laid.

     Beat.  They look at each other curiously.  How much does the
     other guy know?

     125   EXT. ST. REGIS -- DAY                              125

     Russell and band spill out of limo.  The New York cluster of
     hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside.  They hold collector's
     sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic
     markers in hand.  William in tow crawls out of the limo last.
     Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk.  A serious-
     looking Fan (LENNY) approaches Russell with an autograph card.

                         FAN
               I'm from the Church of Lenny.   We bow
               to his will and all that it represents
               - The King of the King of Kings.

                         RUSSELL
               Make it out to - ?

                         FAN
               To Lenny.

     Russell nods -- of course.  He signs, as Dick approaches with
     a well-placed word in his right ear.

                         DICK
               She's here.

     William turns, expecting to see Penny.  Instead we see the
     long-limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate LESLIE.    She
     holds a Nikon camera, and snaps their picture.

                         JEFF
               Leslie!

                         DICK
               Your room is completely stocked, far
               away from any noisy ice machines,
               elevators or maid quarters.  The air-
               conditioning is already on.  And here
               is your security key -- by the way,
               you look stunning.

                         LESLIE
                    (taking treatment for
               granted)
               ThanksI'llseeyoulater.

     Nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift
     in welcoming Leslie.   Dick's New York side is almost military.

                         DICK
               Bags in five!  Cars leave for the party
               at six!

     William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone
     knowing the subtext.  Nobody saying a word.  William pulls his
     heavy bag out of the back of the limousine.
     The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York
     sidewalk.  Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper,
     the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels
     and thick telephone books from every city.

                         DICK (cont'd)
               You know.  There are lighter souvenirs.

                         WILLIAM
                    (embarrassed)
               Well -- I kept thinking I was going
               home the next day --

                         DICK
               I did too.  Fifteen years ago.

     All help him with his spilled souvenirs.  Russell shares a
     private look with the kid.  Nearby Leslie greets other band
     members.

                         WILLIAM
               Ric!

     It's Super Zeppelin fan Ric Nunez.

                         RIC
                    (whispers)
               It's all happening.  Zeppelin is at
               the Plaza.  So's four other bands.
               They're partying up there right now.
               Sapphire, and Miss Penny Lane too...
               She wants you to call her.
                    (William reacts)
               They're all staying under the name
               Emily Rugburn.

     William takes in the information, while regarding Ric's new
     custom  shirt, which features the words to Zeppelin's "The Rain
     Song."

                         RUSSELL
                    (exiting with Leslie)
               After the party.  I'll come to your
               room - I promise.  We'll talk.  This
               is Leslie, by the way.  Leslie, this
               is our wayward friend from Rolling
               Stone.  The Enemy.

     They shake, she smiles randomly.

     126   INT. ST. REGIS FRONT DESK -- NIGHT                    126

     William checks in.

                         CLERK
               William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent
               call from a Mr. "Ben Fong-Torres."
               He's holding for you, right now.

     William takes the phone.  The Clerk watches curiously as the
     kid adopts a new persona.

                         WILLIAM
                    (deep voice)
               Hello.

                                             INTERCUT

     INT. JANN'S OFFICE -- SAN FRANCISCO -- AFTERNOON

     On a rainy day in San Francisco, Ben Fong-Torres stands in the
     copy-strewn office of the young editor/publisher JANN WENNER.
     Several other editors are also present in the background,
     including David Felton with cigarette-holder in mouth, and a
     prep-school Fact-Checker named ALLISON.

                         BEN
               Congratulations.  It's gonna be a cover.
               Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week
               in L.A.  we need you back in San
               Francisco tomorrow.  We'll finish the
               story here.

     William is overwhelmed with many emotions, fear topping the
     list.

                         BEN (cont'd)
               You can tell the band.  Allison, our
               fact checker, needs you to transmit
               whatever you have of the story, tonight,
               now, along with your notes.  There is
               a mojo at the Daily News they'll let
               us use -

                         WILLIAM
               Mojo?

                         BEN
               A mojo.  It's a very modern machine
               that transmits pages over the telephone.
               It only takes eighteen Minutes a page...

     126A  EXT. NEW YORK STREETS -- NIGHT                         126A

     The sound of feet on pavement.  William looks at addresses,
     hustling to the Daily News office.

     126B  INT. DAILY NEWS COPY STATION -- NIGHT                    126B

     William tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the
     large and clunky earliest model fax machine -- "The Mojo."  We
     hear David Bowie.  "The Jean Genie."

     A127  EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT                         A127

     William weaves, exhausted, into the Stillwater press party at
     this legendary New York nightspot.  The Doorman, who checks
     i.d.s, sees the kid and expresses great doubt.

                         DENNIS HOPE
               He's okay, he's with us -

     Hope shoves him past the Guard, and sends him into a very mature
     new world.

     127   INT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT                         127

     The famous hub of New York rock and roll.  A strong whiff of
     decadence mixes with youthful naivete.  Not a hippie in sight.
     William walks through, looking for familiar faces.  Overhead
     we hear Stillwater.  "If You Say Nothing."  The party is filled
     with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British
     journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather
     jackets.  Russell grabs him by the arm.

                         RUSSELL
               Ah ha!  There you are, ya little fucker.
               Come on --

                         WILLIAM
               I have some good news.

                         RUSSELL
               -- I'll piss to that.  Follow me.

     A128  INT. MAX'S BEDROOM                              A128

     They enter the small bathroom.  Russell bolts the door, faces
     the urinal and pees.  His own music throbs in the next room.

                         RUSSELL
               Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants
               to manage Me solo.  Says to lose the
               band by February.  Should I do it?  I
               have no perspective anymore.

     William pees in silence.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               At what point do I just take the hint?
               Nobody Loves this band.  People like
               us, do they love us?

                         WILLIAM
               I do.

                         RUSSELL
                    (then pissed)
               Oh - get this - somebody told Penny
               Lane I sold her for beer.  The network
               of these chicks!  Like I would do that.
               It's Jeff who told her, right?  Not
               you, right?  None of these guys can
               just calm down and be a fuckin adult.
               Now she's here, freaking out.  Leslie
               can smell it.

                         WILLIAM
                    (exiting)
               Wait.  I've got something to tell -

     But he finds himself trailing Russell to the back room bar.

     128   INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME TIME                    128

     Leslie in the bathroom.  Penny enters and watches her
     discreetly.  They stand together, side-by-side at the mirror.
     Leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at Penny.  She
     knows.

     129   INT. BACKROOM -- NIGHT                              129

     William sits with the band.  Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs
     nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing.  They share a
     look, feigning casualty.

                         WILLIAM
               You guys -- you guys --
                    (beat)
               You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling
               Stone.

     Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink
     in... and goes wild.  Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid.
     It's big news.  Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass
     raised.

                         JEFF
                    (tears welling, instantly)
               The cover of Rolling Stone.  And we
               made it together.  They don't just put
               somebody with one little hit on the
               cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine,
               man.  We made it.

     The band nods solemnly, importantly.

                         JEFF (cont'd)
                    (continuing)
               Damn it -- I'm gonna enjoy this.  The
               first time I bought that magazine The
               Beatles were on the cover.  Four of
               them.  Four of us.  Together.
               TOGETHER!

     They begin singing the then-current Dr. Hook and the Medicine
     Show hit, "The Cover of the Rolling Stone" to William.

                         LESLIE
               Who is that girl?  She's creeping me
               out.  She's not with any of you, is
               she?

                         WILLIAM/DICK
               She's with me.

     And now Leslie has confirmation.  A symphony of looks, as Dick
     gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny.  Penny Lane's
     eyes fill and she runs out.  Russell stands... and sees William
     also stand.  William turns and follows her.  Russell stands
     watching, and does not leave.   We hear Elton John's  "Mona
     Lisas and Mad Hatters."

     130   EXT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT                         130

     William exits as a crush of Partygoers arrives.  He doesn't
     know where she is.   He takes off to examine the cabs stuck in
     traffic.  Song continues.

     POV WILLIAM

     He looks in the backs of cabs.   None of them her.

     Music continues.  He runs down the streets, looking for her.
     Alone in New York City.

     131   INT. PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT                              131

     William on the house phone.

                         WILLIAM
               Emily Rugburn, please.

     132   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT                         132

     William approaches Suite 702.  The door is open.  He hears new
     band voices, and sees new faces. MUSICIAN  # 1 intercepts him.

                         WILLIAM
               Hi.  I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.

                         MUSICIAN # 1
               Aren't we all -

     Musician types are leaving.

                         WILLIAM
               Where is she?

     Room Service arrives.  Some appetizers and a large expensive
     bottle of champagne on ice.

                         ROOM SERVICE GUY
               Can somebody sign for this?

     William does.

                         ROOM SERVICE GUY (cont'd)
               Thank you Mr. Rugburn.

     Two more Musicans (English) exit the back room party.  The
     room is clearing out.

                         ENGLISH MUSICIAN
               She's sick.  Let's get out of here.

                         ENGLISH MUSICIAN # 2
               She used to be so much more together.

     William watches all, champagne in hand, and finds her in the
     backroom.  She's addled and nearly passed out.

                         WILLIAM
               What happened?

                         PENNY LANE
               I'm not good at goodbyes.

     She sags.  He grabs the phone.

                         PENNY LANE (cont'd)
               You're the last of my old-time friends.
               Polexia went to England with Deep
               Purple... can you believe that?  Even
               Sapphire's out someplace else.  All
               she left was her quaaludes.

                         WILLIAM
               Oh -- wonderful.
                    (into phone)
               Front desk?  Please send a doctor.
               Room... what room?  703.  702.   Both
               rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn,
               Yes.  My wife's had an accident with
               some quaaludes.  Yes - I'll do that.

     The room has emptied out.  Just them, and the remnants of a
     movable party that has moved elsewhere.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               Wake up!

     He struggles to get her on her feet.  She tips over on her
     strappy platform shoes.  He struggles to untie them.

     133   EXT. GRADUATION -- DAY                              133

     The School band plays "Colour My World."  School PRINCIPAL at
     the podium.

                         PRINCIPAL
               And now... out graduating class!  Jane
               Abbott!

     A peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma.   Elaine Miller
     watches dolefully in the audience.

     134   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                              134

     William holds Penny in his arms.  Finally she is close to him.

     135   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY                         135

                         PRINCIPAL
               Victor Sanchez!

     Warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma.  He
     takes off his mortar board to flash an American flag bandana.
     He raises his diploma in victory.

     136   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                              136

     William holds Penny Lane, and keeps her moving.  It's a sagging,
     messy slow dance.

                         WILLIAM
               "In the unlikely event of a water
               landing... "

                         PENNY
               "... you will be required to wear a
               safety vest."

                         WILLIAM
               Keep going.

                         PENNY
               "Please place all stowable luggage in
               the overhead compartments... out in the
               seat in front of you."

                         WILLIAM
                    (prompting)
               "Seat and tray tables."

                         PENNY
               "And seat-backs and tray-tables should
               be in their full and upright and locked
               positions... "

     137   EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY -- DAY                         137

                         PRINCIPAL
               And now... out "Pending" Graduates!
                    (pause)
               William Miller... not present.

     Elaine applauds her son, stoically.  It is a dagger through
     her heart.  A sympathetic look from a nearby Mother continues
     the pain.

     138   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT                              138

     They move slowly, she's fading.

                         WILLIAM
               "In the tragic event of a water
               landing..."

     139   EXT. GRADUATION - DAY                              139

     The Principal shares a few thoughts:

                         PRINCIPAL
               And to the class of 1973, we say --
                    (beat)
               Don't forget to remember yourself as
               you are today...  Full of hope... and
               the dream that everything is possible...
               Remember this, twenty years from now,
               when we all own home computers and we
               all travel in shiny electrical cars
               that move swiftly, high above the
               city...
                    (beat)
               They key to the future is keeping today
               alive forever.

     Elaine's head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents.  The
     day will never end.  Mrs. Deegan slips into the seat next to
     her.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               First.  Release the guilt.
                    (Elaine nods)
               Second -

                         ELAINE
               Please let there be only two, because
               I can't get past Number One.

                         MRS. DEEGAN
               Second.  Leave a little room for the
               other teachers in this world.  He's
               out there looking for mentors.

                         ELAINE
               He's got twelve of them.  They're lined
               up.  He's just tired of me.

     A140  INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                              A140

     William holds Penny.  She is very woozy.

                         PENNY
               "... you will be required to..."
                    (gives up)
               I'm tired.

     She is very groggy, as he holds her.

                         WILLIAM
               Well.  Now that I have your attention.
               And you may not remember this later, I
               just want to make it clear that... Hey!
                    (she blinks, barely awake
               again)
               I know you've heard this before.  And
               I have never said this to anybody, not
               really - well, nobody who didn't legally
               have to say it back to me, but -
                    (tries to be casual)
               I love you.  And I have a hard time
               sharing you with all of rock and roll
               because I - why am I nervous? - You'll
               never remember this - HEY! -
                    (she blinks)
               I love you, and I'm about to boldly go
               where...  Many men have gone before...

     He kisses her.  A doctor and nurse come crashing into the room.
     They push past William and pull Penny into the bathroom.  He
     sits on the edge of the bed, looking into the bathroom, as
     they work on her.  We hear Stevie Wonder.  "My Cherie Amor."

     140   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                   140

     Doctor places a tube down Penny Lane's throat.  A bored nurse
     holds a water-bag, lowering it to ground level.

     WILLIAM'S POV INTO BATHROOM

     Her feet sticking out, wriggling.  He watches, as music
     continues.

     ON THE BATHTUB

     Her amber-colored stomach contents look like a Jackson Pollack
     portrait of the era, with three partially dissolved pills.
     Doctor hands enter frame and remove them.  Music continues.

     141   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                         141

     The Doctor re-appears, and sits down next to William, as the
     Nurse exits.  The Doctor withdraws a three-page report form.

                         DOCTOR
               Your wife will be okay for now -

                         WILLIAM
               Thank you Doctor.

                         DOCTOR
               However, she says you're her brother.

                         WILLIAM
                    (eyes report)
               She's a little confused.

     The ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby.  The Doctor
     sizes up the situation.

                         DOCTOR
               Nice champagne.

                         WILLIAM
               I don't have a driver's license.  With
               me.

                         DOCTOR
               Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary.
               I'd prefer to take care of this without
               facing the dawn at the police station.
               So if you can find a way to get this
               girl - your wife - back home to her
               parents, I'd let you pay me anything
               you can afford.  Because you don't
               appear to be related to the famous
               Rugburns of Rhode Island.

     His eyes flick to the champagne.  The kid takes a hint, reaches
     over to the champagne.

                         WILLIAM
               Happy Anniversary.

     The Doctor puts the champagne in his bag.

                         DOCTOR
               She won't be good company, but keep
               her awake for another four hours.

     142   INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER -- MORNING                    142

     Song continues.  William and Penny drag themselves through the
     airport.  He guides her to the ticket counter.  Penny wears
     her green coat, large sunglasses.  He sorts through her many
     partial tickets.  They are both so tired.  She shakes off her
     coat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops
     it through her bags.  She's irritable, and ready to go home.

     143   INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING                         143

                         PENNY
                    (baring her soul)
               When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend
               took me to a Rolling Stones concert -
               and I freaked out and I rushed up to
               the front of the stage and then a
               thousand people had the same idea at
               the same time and I was getting crushed.
               And I couldn't breathe and that thought
               flashed through me - almost like a car
               accident - I thought I might die.  And
               it was in the middle of "Midnight
               Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me.
               And he came over, and came to the front
               of the stage, and he pulled me out.
               And they took me backstage and they
               gave me coke with ice and a - and a
               lemon.  And I never went home.

                         WILLIAM
               What about your Mom?

                         PENNY
               She always said - "Marry Up." Marry
               someone grand.  That's why she named
               me Lady.

                         WILLIAM
                    (horrified)
               She named you Lady?

                         PENNY
               Lady Goodman.

                         WILLIAM
               No.

                         PENNY
               You never really get used to it, either.

                         WILLIAM
               Well -- this -- this just explains
               everything.

     He wishes it did.  She rubs her stomach.  It's a rocky morning.

                         WILLIAM (cont'd)
               See you back in the real world.

                         PENNY
               See you back there.

     She kisses his forehead, and takes off down the accordian
     leading to her plane.  She drops her coat again, bending down
     to retrieve it.

                         WILLIAM
               Hey Lady!

     Four Woman turn, but not Penny.  She disappears.

     144   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY                              144

     Penny Lane settles into her seat on the airplane.  She notices
     William watching from the terminal window, and waves.

                         STEWARDESS
               Please extinguish all flammable items,
               and return all seats and tray tables to
               their full and upright locked positions.

     She mouths along with the words.  There is no one to share the
     joke with.  And then a few blurry memories come back to her.
     She gestures to him... understanding him more fully... as he
     disappears.

     145   INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY                         145

     William walks alongside her plane, moving from terminal window
     to terminal window.  Catching her glance again, he's picking
     up steam.  What's she saying?

     146   INT. PLANE - DAY                                   146

     She keeps watching as he runs alongside, still keeping up with
     her plane.  She now fully remembers, and places her outstretched
     fingers on the window.  She mouths the words:   I'll see you
     back home!

     ON WINDOW

     He us running through her fingers.

     CLOSE ON WILLIAM

     Who can run no further.

                                             FADE OUT

     FADE UP

     147   INT. BAND PLANE -- DAY                              147

     Russell and William are in mid-interview.  The kid's microphone
     is out.  It's a little bit of a rough flight.  William wears
     the same clothes.

                         RUSSELL
               Why didn't you come back to the party?
               Bob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting
               at our table for... had to be an hour,
               right?  Just  Rapping.  Bob Dylan!  I
               kept looking for you.  I was going to
               introduce you.

     The kid feels pain.

                         JEFF
               What happened to you last night?

                         WILLIAM
               It's a log story.

     A sharp jolt of turbulence.  Russell begins pounding on the
     card table in rhythm.

                         RUSSELL
                    (singing Buddy Holly)
               "Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "

                         DICK
               Please.

                         RUSSELL
               "Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
               Sue... "

     A moment of laughter, and then bam.  Jeff's drink rises and
     suspends briefly in mid-air.  The plane takes another mighty
     knock.

                         JEFF
               We shouldn't be here.

                         RUSSELL
               Doris, we miss you!

     Fear is creeping in around the edges.  William, already an
     uneasy flier, looks down.

                         PILOT'S VOICE
               This is Craig, your pilot.  It appears
               we've caught the edge of that electrical
               storm we were trying to outrun.  Buckle
               up tight now.  We're gonna do our best
               to getcha out of this.

     The rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up.

                         JEFF
               "Electrical storm?"

                         RUSSELL
                    (strapping in for a roller
               coaster)
               Rock and roll.

     The sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
     nervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and
     stabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Wooooooo Baby!

     A moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
     himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.

                         CO-PILOT
               We're gonna try to land in Tupelo.
               We're going to have to cut the inside
               lighting for the next several minutes.
               We found a field to land in.

     The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.

                         DENNIS HOPE
               A field?

                         JEFF
               I can't breathe.

     Push in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
     sounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.

                         CO-PILOT
               It might be a rough set-down.  We should
               be fine.
                    (cracking at the edges)
               But what we do say in a situation like
               this is - We would pass but before the
               plane ... disassembled.  However, God
               help us, if there's anything you want
               to say to each other, any secrets,
               anything like that, now would be a
               good time.  But just hang in there.
               We'll get you out of this.

     He returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail
     suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights
     shut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door
     swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.

                         DICK
               And everyone thinks it's so glamorous
               out here.

                         LARRY
                    (oddly detached)
               He just told us we're gonna die.

                         JEFF
                    (insecurities running wild)
               We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --

                         RUSSELL
               Shut up.

                         JEFF
               -- we can't even die in an original
               city!

                         RUSSELL
               C'mon Dennis, get us a better city.

     Nervous laughter.  Another sheet of hail hits the plane.

                         LESLIE
               Oh my God.

     PUSH IN ON WILLIAM

     Just shaking.  Nearly in tears.   Hyperventilating.

                         RUSSELL
               If something should happen.  I love
               all of you.  I don't think we have to
               do the secrets thing.

     The plane shakes.  Now lightening strikes very close.  A
     flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
     evaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the
     darkness:

                         DENNIS HOPE
               I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
               A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on
               going.  I don't know if he's alive or
               dead, but I'm sorry.

                         LESLIE
                    (gripped with fear)
               Oh my God.

     The plane wildly rises, and falls.  It stops for a moment.  A
     strange smooth patch.

                         DICK
               I love you all too, and you're my
               family.  Especially since Marna left
               me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar
               or two, here and there, it was because
               I knew I'd earned it.

                         RUSSELL
               I slept with Marna, Dick.

                         JEFF
               I did too.

                         LARRY
               I waited until you broke up with her.
               But me too.

                         JEFF
               I also slept with Leslie, when you
               were fighting.

                         RUSSELL
               You... slept with Jeff?

                         LESLIE
               Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the
               summer we decided to be free of all
               rules.

                         RUSSELL
                    (to Jeff)
               And you say you "love me."

                         JEFF
                    (the truth)
               I don't love you, man.  I never did.

                         RUSSELL
               Please.  Enough.

                         JEFF
               NONE of us love you.  You act above
               us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!

                         LARRY
               Finally.  The truth.

                         JEFF
               You just held it over us, like you
               light leave... like we're lucky to be
               with you. And we had to live with it.
               I had to live with you, and now I might
               die with you and it's not fucking fair.

     William watches, catatonic.

                         RUSSELL
                    (to Larry and Ed)
               You hate me?  You too?

     Larry stares at him.  Ed says nothing.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               All this love.  All this loyalty.
                    (incredulous, giddy)
               And you don't even like me.

                         JEFF
               And I'm still in love with you Leslie.

     Bam.  The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.

                         LESLIE
               I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut
               up! Shut up!  Shut up!

                         RUSSELL
                    (to Jeff)
               Whatever happens, you're dead.

                         JEFF
               Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not
               now.  You were sleeping with Penny,
               that groupie.  Last summer, and up
               until yesterday.  Why don't you tell
               Leslie THAT?

     Russell tries to get up and attack him.  The force keeps him
     in his seat.  He yells.  Loud.

                         DENNIS
                    (freaking out)
               I quit.

     The turbulence worsens.  William finds his mouth saying
     emotional words he cannot control.

                         WILLIAM
               "That groupie?"  She was a Band-Aid.
               All she did was love your band.  And
               you all -- you used her, all of you.
               You used her and threw her away.  She
               almost died last night, while you were
               with Bob Dylan.  You're always talking
               about the fans, the fans, the fans.
               She was your biggest fan and you threw
               her away.  And if you can't see that,
               that's your biggest problem.

     Russell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking
     very very hard.  Leslie is crying.

                         ED
               I'm gay.

     They all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken
     dialogue of the movie.)

     Then.

     The plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes
     through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float
     downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very
     uneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.
     Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.

                         CO-PILOT
               Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE
               ALIVE!!  WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!

     Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell.  Suddenly, the
     alternative seems far more attractive.  We hear Rod Stewart's
     "Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.

     148   INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY                    148

     Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long
     and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is
     different now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.
     We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William
     hustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much
     bigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.

                         JEFF
               Well, I think we can build on this new
               honesty.

     Boom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The
     band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport
     terminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.
     He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band
     continues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,
     they've forgotten him.

     Then Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All
     now stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-
     occupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.  Music
     continues.

     ON AIRPLANE DEPARTURE SCHEDULE

     William's finger finds San Francisco.

     149   INT. CAB -- SAN FRANCISCO -- DAY                         149

     The kid checks the address as he arrives at the MJB Building,
     and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of
     Rolling Stone Magazine.  He still wears the same clothes from
     last night in New York.

     150   INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY                    150

     William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from  a
     friendly RECEPTIONIST, a paragon of new cool.

                         RECEPTIONIST
               Leave your package at the desk.

                         WILLIAM
               I'm not a messenger.  I'm one of your
               writers.  William Miller.

     He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag.

     151   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY                         151

     William walks down the center aisle.  Editors and writers look
     at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this
     exhausted 15 year-old writer.  At the end of the aisle, like a
     human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres.

                         BEN
               You're William Miller?

     The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired
     nod of the head.

                         WILLIAM
               Yep.

                         BEN
                    (putting it all together)
               Oh baby.

     Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor-
     publisher.

     152   INT. JANN WENNER'S OFFICE -- DAY                         152

     William sits.  Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue.
     The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air.
     Everyone is focused and quick.  The conversation is machine-
     gun like. Jann Werner turns to the kid.

                         JANN
               We can't run this piece.

     The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking
     sheets on the table.

                         BEN
               You obviously saw more than you wrote
               about.  After eight days on the road
               with these guys.

                         DAVID FELTON
               Didn't anything happen?

                         JANN
               And where are you in this piece?  What
               did you want to write?  Because this
               reads like what they wanted you to
               write.

                         BEN
               What happened to your highly-touted
               think piece on limitations of a middle-
               level Band in the face of success?

     William sits speechless.  It's sinking in.  Failure.
     Conversation continues at a fast pace:

                         JANN
               We can push up Chet's Who cover -

                         FACT CHECKER
               Good 'cause it's going to take me three
               days to get through this research.
               It's all handwritten, on little slips.
               Plus, they all refer to woman as
               "chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a
               problem with that.  I know it's a side
               issue.

                         DAVID FELTON
                    (sympathetic, loquacious)
               It's a "puff piece."  you fell for
               'em.  It happens.  A relationship forms.
               You want them to like you.
                    (wistful, chewing cigarette
               holder)
               Happened with me and Charlie Manson.
               He was a very charming... lively...
               charismatic...

     Felton catches himself swooning.  The other are staring at
     him.  He snaps out of it.

                         DAVID FELTON (cont'd)
               ... mass-murderer.

                         WILLIAM
               Please let me finish it.  Give me
               tonight to work on it.

                         FACT CHECKER
               Chet's piece is all fact-checked and
               ready.

                         JANN
                    (to William)
               Get some sleep.  We'll do another story
               sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.

                         FACT CHECKER
               His research is all on little bits of
               paper.  Did I say that?

                         WILLIAM
               Ben.  You told me to send what I had.
               It's not finished.

                         FACT CHECKER
               That's being charitable.

     Ben looks at the kid, then at Jann.  Jann scans the kid's face
     for a beat, nods.

                         JANN
               Let him use the big office.   It's
               where Hunter used to write.

     William rises, gratefully.  He shakes Jann's hand.

                         FACT CHECKER
                    (pointed re: his age)
               You can type.

                         WILLIAM
               Yes.  It took it in grade school.

     153   INT. BIG OFFICE -- NIGHT                              153

     William sits in the "big" office.  It's a small white tank.
     After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large
     electric typewriter.  His research, transcripts and some band
     photos sit nearby.  He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of
     coffee.  He looks at the phone.

     INT. LESTER BANGS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Crazy jazz is playing.  Lester Bangs on the phone.

                         LESTER BANGS
               Aw, man.  You made friends with them!
               See, friendship is the booze they feed
               you.  They want you to get drunk on
               feeling like you belong.

                                         INTERCUT:

     INT. ROLLING STONE -- NIGHT

     William in the empty Rolling Stone office.

                         WILLIAM
                    (ruefully)
               Well, it was fun.

                         LESTER BANGS
               They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I
               met you.  You are not "cool."

                         WILLIAM
               I know.  Even when I though I was, I
               knew I wasn't.

                         LESTER BANGS
               That's because we are uncool!  And
               while women will always be a problem for
               guys like us, most of the great   art in
               the world is about that very problem.
               Good-looking people have no spine!
               Their art never lasts!  They  get the
               girls, but we're smarter.

                         WILLIAM
               I can really see that now.

                         LESTER BANGS
               Yeah, great art is about conflict and
               pain and guilt and longing and love
               disguised as sex, and sex disguised as
               love... and let's face it, you got a
               big head start.

                         WILLIAM
               I'm glad you were home.

                         LESTER BANGS
               I'm always home!  I'm uncool!

                         WILLIAM
               Me too!

                         LESTER BANGS
                    (leveling)
               The only true currency in this bankrupt
               world if what we share with someone
               else when we're uncool.

                         WILLIAM
                    (distraught)
               I feel better

                         LESTER
               My advice to you.  I know you think
               those guys are your friends.  You want
               to be a true friend to them?

     William takes a deep breath.  Looks at the research cassettes and
     notebooks.  The empty page.

                         LESTER BANGS
               Be honest and unmerciful.
                    (beat)
               You're doing great.  Call me later is
               you want.  I'm always up.

     154   INT. ROLLING STONE OUTER OFFICE -- MORNING               154

     Ben Fong-Torres and David Felton look at William's new
     manuscript with great interest.

                         FELTON
               Read me the opening line.

                         BEN
                    (reads aloud)
               "I am flying high over Tupelo,
               Mississippi, with America's hottest
               band, and we are all about to die."

                         FELTON
               Mmmmm.
                    (as if sampling wine)
               Dark.  Lively.

                         BEN
               Yeah, and it gets better.
                    (impressed)
               Did this all really happen?

     William sleeps restlessly nearby, mouth agape, sitting upright
     in a plastic chair.

                         FACT CHECKER
                    (jealously reaches for
               manuscript)
               Give it to me.  I'll call and check
               the quotes.

     155   INT. NEW TOUR BUS -- DAY                               155

     The band rides in a new tour bus.  The palpable tone in the
     air is -- PANIC.

                         JEFF
               Look.  Let's just piece together our
               information...  because the fact-checker
               asked us all about different parts of
               the story.

                         TONY
               What did he write about?  What's he
               using?

                         JEFF
               It.  All.  He's using it all.

                         RUSSELL
               So what?

                         JEFF
               So what?
                    (beat)
               We come off like amateurs... some
               average band...  trying to come to
               grips, jealous and fighting and breaking
               up - we're buffoons!

                         RUSSELL
               Maybe we just don't see ourselves the
               way we really are.

                         JEFF
               He was supposed to be our friend.

                         RUSSELL
                    (ruefully, remembering)
               I told him to write what he wanted.

     All eyes look to Russell.

                         TONY
                    (to Russell)
               By the way, he has you on acid,
               screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a
               fan's rooftop.

                         RUSSELL
                    (immediately remembering)
               Oh my God.

                         JEFF
               They used him to fuck us.

                         RUSSELL
                    (still back at "Golden
               God")
               I didn't say "Golden God."  Or did I?

                         DICK
               We never took him seriously, and now
               it's serious.

                         RUSSELL
               I liked him as a person.

                         JEFF
               He was never a "person!"  He was a
               journalist!

     Russell nods.  He looks at Silent Ed, drumming soundlessly on
     a rubber pad.

                         RUSSELL
               You.  You had the right idea all along.

     Ed silently nods thanks.

                         DENNIS HOPE
                    (nervously)
               How about the plane flight?

                         DICK
               It's all in there.  But don't worry,
               it's all unspecific who say what.  No
               names are mentioned in the more
               embarrassing sequences, it's just
               completely obvious who's who!  We're
               fucked!

     Silence.

                         RUSSELL
               I forgot he was there.

                         DENNIS HOPE
               Well, they haven't talked to Russell -
               he can always deny the key stuff to
               the fact checker.  Then they can't
               print it.

                         JEFF
                    (brightening)
               Is that true?

                         DENNIS HOPE
               It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me
               earlier, he would have never been on the
               around.

     Dennis hands Russell the phone.

                         DENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
               He'll live.

     156   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY                         156

     William is still being congratulated by his new peers.  We see
     him woozy but beaming, as Allison the Fact Checker comes out
     of her office, waving the manuscript.  She works her way through
     the cluster of editors.

                         FACT CHECKER
               The band just denied 90% of the story.
               It's a fabrication.

     Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused.
     Their congratulations stop on a dime.  The fact checker can't
     resist twisting the knife a little.

                         FACT CHECKER (cont'd)
               You weren't honest.  And worse, you
               wasted our time.

                         WILLIAM
               Did you talk to Russell?

                         FACT CHECKER
               Russell Hammond is the one who denied
               it.

                         BEN
                    (darkly)
               Crazy.

                         FACT CHECKER
                    (one last shot, to William)
               We're going with the Who - !

     The kid has been sandbagged.  The machine of a big-time magazine
     whirs into action on another story, as the cluster moves down
     the hall.

                         SOMEONE'S VOICE
               He's just some fan... what did you
               expect?

     William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind,
     brandishing his cigarette-holder.  He sits down next to the
     kid.

                         FELTON
               Well, I believe you.

     He looks at the kid, decides to offer a personal parable.

                         FELTON (cont'd)
               Jim Morrison once came to my house and
               drank a beer.  The beer is still on my
               mantle.  I'm 35 years old with Jim
               Morrison's beer as a shrine.  I wanted
               to be Earnest Hemingway.  Instead.  I
               have Jim Morrison's beer.
                    (shrugs, he's learned to
               live with it)
               If you didn't make your story up, good
               for you.  If you did make it up... good
               for you.

     The kid looks at him, too tired and still in shock.

                         FELTON (cont'd)
               Say something, so I know you're alive.

                         WILLIAM
               Goodbye.

     He exits.

                         FELTON
               Powerful  word.  Strong.  Final.

     157   INT. BACKSTAGE CREW MEAL - NIGHT                         157

     Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate
     filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato.
     Preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members.
     He drinks a glass of milk.   Out old friend Sapphire takes the
     seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables.

                         RUSSELL
               I feel bad.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Well, at least you feel.  That puts
               you in a higher class of asshole.

     They eat in silence.  Sapphire looks around.  The new breed of
     groupies eye her, as they cruise Russell on the periphery.
     They're bolder, flashier.  She eyes them back with seniority.

                         RUSSELL
               What did I do?

                         SAPPHIRE
               Well - you can do what the big boys
               do.
                    (he looks at her)
               Nothing.

                         RUSSELL
               Yeah.

     The girls still circle Russell nearby.  He's unaware.

                         SAPPHIRE
               You believe these new girls?  None of
               'em take birth control, and they eat
               all the steak.

     She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables.  An ever-sharp
     mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.

                         SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
               They don't even know what it id to be
               a fan!  To blindly love some silly
               piece of music... or some band so much
               that it hurts... please,  they're all
               just after the money.  Shoo --
                    (in their direction)
               Go rob a bank!  It's more honest!

                         RUSSELL
               Is Penny okay?

                         SAPPHIRE
               The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't
               pretty.  She could have died.  I always
               warned her about letting too many guys
               fall in love with her.  I guess I was
               wrong.
                    (shrugs)
               On of 'em saved her life.

     Russell nods.

                         RUSSELL
               Well, it's finally over with Leslie.
               I'm going to call her.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Let her retire.
                    (he doesn't respond)
               You want to lock her up in a house in
               Michigan?  Please.
                    (he doesn't respond)
               Write her a song someday.  She deserves
               it.  Something about that girl brought
               out the best in a lot of...
                    (looks around backstage)
               ... pretty average people.  She deserves
               it...

     Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.

                         SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
                    (forward thinking)
               ... because something tells me twenty
               years from now, we'll remember her...
               and not much else.

     Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true.  Dick passes,
     placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.

                         DICK
               Have a good vacation.  I hope the band
               stays together.  Before it all went
               down the shitter, it was starting to
               get really good.

     Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.  He turns to
     Sapphire.

                         RUSSELL
               I'm not going to blame myself.  I do
               make people happy.  They just shouldn't
               get to know me... 'cause it appears to
               spoil everything.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Don't be so easy on yourself.

                         RUSSELL
               What gives you the right to get this
               personal with me.

                         SAPPHIRE
               Let's not reminisce.

     158   INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHT                    158

     William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses
     in a seat.  He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic.
     A cluster of Flight Attendants pass.  One stops, a stylish young
     woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.

                         ANITA
               William?

     He looks at her.  He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks
     like a Martian.

                         ANITA (cont'd)
               You guys this is my brother!

                         MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    (ad if meeting a celebrity)
               "The Narc?!"

     William looks woefully at them, like a dog who's been hit by a
     car.

                         ANITA
               You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I
               think I'm needed.

                         MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Nice to finally meet you.

                         FEMALE ATTENDANT
               You have a good day!

     Anita looks in her brother's face.

                         ANITA
               You look awful, but that's great.
               You're living your life!  You're finally
               free of... her.

                         WILLIAM
               Yeah.

                         ANITA
               Hey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have
               an adventure together.  You and me,
               finally.  Anywhere you want to go.
               Anywhere in the world.

     159   EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- DAY                         159

     William whistles the family whistle.  Sister and brother trudge
     up the steps.

                         ANITA
               This is not my idea of a good time.

                         WILLIAM
               Just get me to my bed.

                         ANITA
                    (resigned)
               I'll deal with her.

     William whistles again.  Mom meets them at the door.  She looks
     at her trashed son who has finally come home.  For the first
     time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.

     It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit.  The kid
     passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally
     nudging her into his sister.  Anita takes this as an aggressive
     act of love, and hugs her mother back.  Tears stream down Mom's
     face.  Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own
     tears on Anita's face.  Thinking that she's also crying, she
     grabs a tissue for them both.

     160   INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                         160

     The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head,
     poised to enter his room, unseen by them.

                         ANITA
                    (so worried)
               What are we going to do about him?

                         ELAINE
               I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I
               just wish it could have happened to me.

                         ANITA
               The magazine killed his story.

     Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears.  William
     watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure.
     William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep,
     and shuts the door.  A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
     DO NOT DISTURB.  Slight push in.

     ON BED

     He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep.  His
     walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes...
     with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch)  in the center.

     161   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY                         161

     The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond.
     The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight
     Arrow Publishers."  She puts the caller on hold.

                         RUSSELL
               Hi, I'm Russel Hammond.

                         SECRETARY
               You're here regarding?

                         RUSSELL
               My life.

     162   INT. EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAY                         162

     Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits
     on the walls.  He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it.
     Everything in the room fascinates him.

                         RUSSELL
               I don't care what happens.  I don't
               care if you put us on the cover.  But
               you sent us a kid and... and he was a
               fan.   And we all made friends with
               him - absolutely, to get a good story.
               But then we actually liked him.  We
               thought he's... show us our lives in
               some mythic way and I guess... we're
               not mythic.  We panicked.

                         JANN
               You denied most of the story.

                         RUSSELL
               Yeah, well, here's the problem with
               the truth.  It's too true -

                         BEN
               Well, we appreciate the visit.  The
               last time an artist came here, it was
               Buddy Miles and he punched me.

                         RUSSELL
               I'm not punching anybody.  I am
               personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a
               voyage of self-reinvention.  This is
               about William Miller.
                    (counting off fingers)
               He lives with us, he lost his virginity,
               he saw us at our worst, appreciated
               our best, he saved two lives, including
               mine... he smuggled about a half-pound
               of pot into Boston, and we never even
               told him -

     Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an
     eyebrow.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               -- we told him too much, we told him
               everything...  He almost died with us
               over Tupelo... if the band survives
               him, it'll be a miracle... but you
               know, he tried to keep up, and that's
               a journalist to me.

                         JANN
               It's too late.  We're going with a
               different cover.

                         RUSSELL
                    (immediately)
               Thank God.

     But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead
     legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of
     them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.  A second thought.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               You tell me it's too late.  But I could
               go back to my hotel room and... and
               O.D. tonight and something tells me
               you'd find a way to put me on the cover
               of the next issue.  Am I right?

     He looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               I'm learning the game.
                    (beat, shrug)
               We fucked up.  We made friends with him.

                         BEN
               Next time we'll all be more
               professional.

                         RUSSELL
               Maybe so.
                    (beat, an odd thought)
               But God forbid, the day comes when
               selling yourself is as important as
               the music you make.
                    (rueful, to Hendrix on the
               wall)
               You might have died at the right time,
               my friend.

                         JANN
               Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.

                         RUSSELL
               Do what you want, but the story is
               true.

     LONG SHOT RUSSELL

     at the entrance.  Raises his hand.

                         RUSSELL (cont'd)
               Good evening!

     162A  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY                              162A

     Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
     Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to
     speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a
     music of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
     He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath
     of life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,
     he begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite
     randomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help
     it.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it
     is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the
     street.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,
     a small crowd begins to form... following him.

     163   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY                         163

     A quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial
     breakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange
     juice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with
     syrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his
     mother facing an old enemy - white sugar.

                         ANITA
               They're called pancakes.  Who knows
               when we'll be together again.  Splurge.
               It's what most people call breakfast.

     Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.

                         ELAINE
               I went through your records.  And I
               found a song to play for you.

     She goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children
     eye each other - what's coming next?  (Song to be chosen)
     The two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding
     their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song
     she clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.
     They look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.
     Somehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating
     breakfast.

     164   ON SIDEWALK                                   164

     Bam.  A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the
     newsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the
     cord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,
     with Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs
     Deep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
     the racks.

                                             FADE OUT

     Music segues to Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks."  Penny Lane's
     sleeping Polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few
     self-portraits.
