                                 David Leslie Johnson




                                                         February 5, 2007   
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b><b>          CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S )
</b>          She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed,
          wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches
          her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.

<b>          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over
          Caitti before you know it.
          Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:

<b>          INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a.
          delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs-  
          across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist.
          A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP
          BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She
          tries to sit up.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't
          want to do this anymore.
          The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes
          Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.

<b>          NURSE
</b>          Your baby is dead. There's nothing.
          else we can do.
          Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.

<b>          KATE
</b>          No, this isn't what's supposed to
          happen. My baby's alive!

<b>          NURSE
</b>          We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're
          so sorry...

<b>          KATE
</b>          But it's still alive! It's moving!
          Feel it, you can feel it!
          Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse-
          pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped
          SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs,
          disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.

<b>          RATE
</b>          No, stop! I want to be asleep! 
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          -DOCTOR-
</b>          TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's
          coming. You're.going to experience
          some pressure now... -
          Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen
          work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him..
          Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband,
          JOHN (late 30's). He smiles at her from behind -the camera.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          It's okay, honeys You're doing great!
          The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse.
          H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain
          again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the
          machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.

<b>          KATE
</b>          This isn't happening. Wake up, wake
          up, wake up...
          Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide
          w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling
          bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric.
          W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.

<b>          NURSE
</b>          Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a
          girl .
          The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

<b>          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          -- then snaps awake. She's been having a nightmare. John lies
          n ext to her in bed. Be stirs, but doesn't wake. Kate slips out
          of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom;

<b>          INT. KATE AND JOHN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Kate closes the door. We now see that she's not pregnant in
          reality, only in her nightmare. She slides to the cold floor in
          t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry...

<b>          INT. DOCTOR BROWNING'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Water TRICKLES in a little Zen fountain. Kate sits across from
          -DR. -BROWNING, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's.

<b>          DR. BROWNING
</b>          A lot of women experience difficulties
          around the anniversary of the
          miscarriage or the baby's expected due
          date. It's perfectly normal.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>
<b>          KATE
</b>          I was thinking of" going back to work.
          I really thought 1 was doing better.

<b>          DR. BROWNING
</b>          You are. Think about where you were
          just four months ago. -
          (off Kate's look)
          Are you still sober?
          Kate hesitates. Dr. Browning gives her a penetrating look.

<b>          KATE
</b>          I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome
          the other day.

<b>          DR. BROWNING
</b>          Did you stop?

<b>          KATE
</b>          I really wanted to. The thought went
          through m' head, you know. it wasn't
          for me, it just might be nice to have a
          bottle handy in case we had guests.

<b>          DR. BROWNING.
</b>          But you didn't go in?

<b>          KATE
</b>          No.

<b>          DR. BROWNING
</b>          That's all that matters. Let's try to
          stay focused on the. positive. Grief is
          different for everyone. You have to
          take it at your own pace.. Keep writing
          in your journal. You're doing fine.
          Rate smiles weakly. unconvinced.

<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY
</b>
          Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window. She steps'
          back to admire her work, then sighs. Now what? Now that she s
          done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big.

<b>          INT. NURSERY - DAY
</b>
          Kate sits in a rocking chair, gazing out a distinctive ARCHED
          'WINDOW. We realize that she's -In a fully furnished and decorated
          nursery. Crib, changing table, baby swing. No baby.

<b>          EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
          It's a big, dramatic home in an affluent neighborhood. Kate
          % crosses the backyard into the nearby woods.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b>
          After a short walk, Kate sits by a PEACEFUL BROOK lost in her
          thoughts. ,She pulls a JOURNAL filled. with handwritten entries
          from her coat pocket. After a beat,'she begins to write.

<b>          EXT. SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF - DAY
</b>
          Class has just let out, PARENTS arriving to pick up their KIDS.
          But the playground is MOSTLY SILENT -- these children an deaf,
          communicating to one another and their teachers by sign language.
          'Kate pulls up in a luxury minivan. Her five-year-old daughter MAX
          runs over togreet her. She's almost- ridiculously cute.
          (NOTE: Max doesn't speak. Her "dialogue" is SIGNED and
          SUBTITLED. She wears a REARING AID- to help her read lips. when
          people speak to her, they must face her and/or sign.)
          Kate kisses Max's'head and helps her into the van, buckling her
          car seat. Max shows her an art project she's bringing home.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Wow, did you make this?

<b>          MAX
</b>
<b>          MY TEACHER HELPED.
</b>
<b>          INT./EXT. KATE'S MINIM - DAY
</b>
          Kate's' driving. She stops at an intersection. A PREGNANT WOMAN
          crosses the street in front of them and stops at the corner. Kate
          watches her for a long beat as if transfixed...
          In the backseat, Max-CLAPS her hands to get Kate's attention.
          Kate turns and sees Max pointing to the traffic light. IVs
          green. A car horn HONKS. Kate snaps -out of it and drives off.

<b>          INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of..
          music. She plays a few NOTES, frowns, tries again, takes a pencil
          and erases what she's written down.
          She pauses to look over-at a beautiful ORCHID in an ornate plants=
          by the window. For a moment, she just stares at it. Then:
          13 1 She's startled by something outside BOUNCING off the side
           of the house. She closes her eyes, frustrated. BANGI EANG1
           BANG! She tries to ignore it, but can't.

<b>          'EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
          Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big
          for her and the hoop's too.high. Every time she tries to shoot,
          the ball falls short and BANGS against the house.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5.
</b>          Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks:
          Stop banging that against the house!
          I'm trying-to work!.

<b>          MAX
</b>
<b>          SORRY.
</b>          Max gives an abashed look. Kate sighs. She knows she was too
          harsh with her.

<b>          KATE
</b>          -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a
          break for a little while, okay?
          Max nods. Kate goes. back inside.
          A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL,
          Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky,
          the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform.
          Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around
          her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but
          when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..-

          Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices
          something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them
          from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too.

<b>          KATE
</b>          What did she say to me.back there? It

          ready to give a scolding, but can't find who she's looking for:

          Then she notices a closet behind her. The door. is ajar. She

          pauses, suddenly concerned for some reason. She opens the door.
          As John reaches for-the phone, CAMERA MOVES IN on Kate. She
          watches from the doorway, her  face already registering dread. She
          knows. Even before he answers the phone, somehow she knows.

<b>          EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

          The sky has turned gray. Kate stares out at the hotel parking-
          lot, smoking a cigarette.  - Her eyes are red;- but she's long since
          cried-herself out. John stands by the open-sliding glass door.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          .The birth family is claiming her body.
          They're planning a private service.
          He looks to Kate for a reaction, but she has none. He continues:

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Sister Abigail thinks she might have
          been playing something called "The
          Choking Game." It's a kind of
          schoolyard dare. You try to get a rush
          by having someone choke you until you
          almost pass out. There have been cases
          where kids have tried it alone and
          accidentally hanged themselves.
          A beat. Kate's voice is distant, as;

<b>          KATE
</b>          So that's it? She just vanishes from
          our lives?

<b>          JOHN

          the word "closure,." I'm going to-claw
          your eyes out.
          She's not angry, just matter-of-fact. Be wants to say something,
          but holds his tongue. Silence hangs heavy between them.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Maybe we're not supposed.to do this.

          This brings Kate back to reality. She eyes him coolly.

          already thinking about replacing her?

          Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
          Esther stapled to it. Her- case file.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          19.
</b>
<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          For the most -part, she's an'ideal
          child. She's originally from Russia,
          but her English is flawless, Smart as
          a.tvhip and very mature Â°for her age. I
          don't think I've-ever had to tell her
          .anything-twice and I've never had to
          clean-up after her.. She's a bit of a-
          nQat-freak.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          I think we can handle that.

<b>          SISTER.ABIGAIL
</b>          She's also fiercely independent.,
          Whatever the other-children want to do,
          she wants to.dc the opposite.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          She told me they make fun of her.

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make-
          things any easier on herself. She just
          doesn't seem interested in friends..
          She doesn't even play like a normal
          child. She just reads and paints.
          Most of the time she barely-speaks.

<b>            KATE  
</b>          Why do'you think that is?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL .
</b>          Well, like most of the girls here,
          there's been no shortage of hardship in
          her life.- She's been orphaned twice--
          her birthmother died of AIDS, then the
          American family who adopted her was-
          killed in.a house fire. And I strongly
          suspect that she's been sexually abused
          as well.

<b>          KATE
</b>          By who?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I don't know. There's nothing in her
          -history, but that doesn't necessarily
          mean anything. Russian adoption -
          records. are notoriously unreliable.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Then what are you basing this on?
          Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          20.
</b>
<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I wish I knew. There's just something
          missing with her. A-spark you see in a
          child's eyes that isn't there. I've
          only seen that-before in cases where
          the child had been severely
          traumatized. It might also explain -
          some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Like what?

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          She refuses to shower or change clothes
          with the other girls.' She won't even
          allow the housemother in-the bathroom
          with her. She.'.s also very concerned
          with her physical appearance for her
          age. She's like a teenager getting
          ready for a date every morning. She
          insists on wearing dresses-every day.
          The ribbons around her wrists and neck
          stay on day and night. . The only
          trouble we ever had with her was when
          we tried to take them off. She kicked
          two of Sister Francis' teeth-out.
          Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.

<b>          SISTER ABIGAIL
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to
          discourage you. If you're serious,
          I'll do everything I can to-expedite
          the process, given the circumstances.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          My one reservation is..this. When-an
          adoption fails, it's usually because
          the parents didn't know what to expect.
          -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what
          to expect because the plain fact of the-
          matter is that-I don't knaw.

          around in the pool. Everyone else is gathered around Esther,
          who's opening a few small presents. She unwraps a BOOK OF SIGN
          LANGUAGE and gasps excitedly.

          John distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and Daniel does
          a huge cannonball into the pool. SPLASH!
          Suddenly, Esther squeals with glee. She's unwrapped an IIRT EASEL
          and NEW PAINTING SUPPLIES. By the time Daniel-'s smiling face pops
          out of the water, he's disappointed to find that Esther has drawn
          John's attention again, barraging him with-hugs and kisses.

          Esther kneels before it, entranced. She turns the black light on

          Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses. She turns to Esther.

<b>          BRENDA

          Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn. After a beat,
          Esther follows Max up the stairs. Brenda stays behind, watching.
          Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the
          top, looking down at Brenda.

<b>          BRENDA
</b>          Gol!
          Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and
          -disappears from eight. only. then does Brenda climb up.
          Max runs to the stairs for- another turn. Brenda reaches the top
          and looks around. She sees Max.' But where's Esther? She turns.

          -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs.
          Brenda SCREAMS as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control. She
          lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her
          arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead.
          Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks. The Homeless Guy startles
          awake. one of the playground mothers comes running to help. But
          Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock. Esther stares
          blankly down.at Brenda from atop the slide. Utterly emotionless.

          BRENDA'S FATHER arrives on the scene. Brenda says something. to

<b>          ESTHER
</b>          Are you going to tell on me?
          Max shrugs.

<b>          ESTHER
</b>          I didn't mean to hurt her. I just
          wanted her-to stop picking on me.
          (off Max's look)
          Don't you hate it when someone is mean
          to you for no reason? Wouldn't you do
          almost anything to make them stop?

          even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks.
          Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick. He takes it
          away from her.

          the nearby'"WINE &amp; SPIRITS" aisle. No big. deal, just a passing
          glance, a flash of idle distraction. Her eyes unreadable. Then:

          Kate-looks back, shocked. Esther has picked up a "COSMOPOLITAN"
          from the newsstand and is'reading the cover aloud-to Max.

<b>          KATE

          The DENTIST lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber
          gloves. The HYGIENIST clips a dental bib around Esther's neck.

<b>          HYGIENIST
</b>          She hasn't had a check-up in about two

          out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense
          song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La--la-la ..."
          Kate stops at a traffic light. Glances outside.
          She's stopped next to a LIQUOR.STORE. Kate quickly looks .away,
          her temptation real enough to startle her. The light turns green
          and she drives off without looking back. Esther keeps SINGING..
          A few blocks later, they pass a BAR. Then a bus shelter with a
          big ABSOLUTE VODKA AD. Kate probably drives by them every day,
          but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never

          She tries to focus on the road, Esther's VOICE grating in her

<b>          JOHN
</b>          Fine, but I don't believe for a"second
          that she just did it for no reason.

<b>          RATE
</b>          That's because she's always on her best
          behavior with you.

<b>          JOEN
</b>          Yeah, because the other kids were
          harassing her. It's the same thing
          here.
          (off her reaction)
          She's from a completely different
          culture Kate. She has to be taught
          that this. behavior isn't appropriate
          but there's nothing malicious about it.
          If'she says she bit him because she was
          scared and he was hurting her, I don't
          see any reason not to believe her.

          But I wasn't completely straightforward

          I've worked with them my entire life.

          to while she was with the Wallaces and
          asked if there'd been any serious
          accidents while she.Was there.. One
          incident was still fresh in everyone's
          minds. A boy in one of her classes was
          stabbed in the throat with a pair of
          'scissors. All the kids-who saw it
          happen said it was an accident, that he
          was running with the scissors and fell.
          But once again, Esther, was there.

          (off their-looks)
          Children like Esther, who've spent
          their entire lives-in institutions,
            have never had' a chance to 'form normal,
          lasting bonds.. The longterm effects
          of 'this- can be devastating.   In the
          very worst cases, children who fail to
          form early attachments are unable to
          learn the difference between'right and
          wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal ---
          .or worse -and and have no remorse
          whatsoever for their actions.' They
          view other human beings as objects,
          pawns for their amusement. And they
          can-be potentially very dangerous.

          It's the LIQUOR STORE she drove by earlier. She's-parked in front

          The two wine bottles sit on the kitchen counter. One bottle is.
          open, a GLASS already poured. But Kate's not drinking it. She's
          just standing these, arms folded, looking at it. The house is.
          quiet. She's alone here. Only her demons to keep her company-
          A long moment of. awful indecision passes,, Kate paralyzed. Then
          she looks up, her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window.,
          Through it, she can see the backyard. It's the swimming pool that
          holds her eyes, its cold-surface rippling in the rain. But- she's
          seeing something else there, something awful. Impossible to know-
          what she's thinking, but whatever it Is, it moves her to action:

          It's called phantom fetal movement,
          like the pain felt in a missing limb.
          I was an amputee and my baby was the

</b>          Esther enters and looks around, confused. There's a PM OF BOOKS
          that.have been knocked to the floor, but Max isn't here.
          Then she sees what's making the GRINDING noise.' It's the TOY.
          ROBOT. It's been placed atop a bookshelf, motor grinding, walking
          on wobbly legs. As it walks, it pushes books off the edge of the,
          bookshelf- onto the floor. That's what made the noise that lured
          her here. Esther scowls furiously at the robot and SHOOTS it.
          Her back is to.the doorway, so she doesn't see Max emerge from her
          hiding place in the bathroom. and slip- past.

          hiding. her. But as she curls up in the shadows, she bumps into a
          table leg and unknowingly knocks over a FLOWER POT.
