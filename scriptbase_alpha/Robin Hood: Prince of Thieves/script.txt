                      PRINCE OF THIEVES

FADE IN:

SUNSET
The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.

BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions.

EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.

INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET

A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
                         INTERROGATOR
           He says you stole his bread.
                         PETER
           It is a lie. I caught him
           stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.    The Interrogator debates.
                         INTERROGATOR
           Cut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      2.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         No!... I took the bread.
                       PETER
         That's not true.
                       ROBIN
         They're not interested in truth.
         You are too weak, Peter. You
         would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Sacrifice for the weaker? How
         noble... As you wish... Cut off
         this one's hand as well!... But
         first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Show them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
                       ROBIN
         And this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.
                       PETER
         That's for five years of hell.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        3.
CONTINUED:
A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
                         VOICE (O.S.)
         Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.
                       ROBIN
         You speak English?
                       SARACEN
         The king's own. Set me free.
                         PETER
         No, Robin.
                       SARACEN
         For pity's sake. Mine is a
         sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
                       PETER
         Don't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
                       ROBIN
         What I would give for an English
         sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
                        ROBIN
         Hmm!   Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
                       SARACEN
         Free me and I will show you a way
         out.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       4.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         Why should we trust you?
                       SARACEN
         If you don't, you are dead men.
                       ROBIN
         He makes a point.
The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.
                         ROBIN
         A good point.
He slashes the man free.

                         PETER
         Robin!
                       ROBIN
         Whatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.
                         SARACEN
         This way!
He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.

INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.

                       SARACEN
         You are fast, my friend.
                       ROBIN
         Five years I've waited for the
         smell of free air. That makes a
         man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking
the way.
                       SARACEN
         You will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                     5.
CONTINUED:
                        SARACEN
         Poison air.   Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.
                       PETER
                (coughing)
         Thanks. I misjudged you.
                       SARACEN
         Save your breath.

Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.
                       SARACEN
         Allah be praised.
                       ROBIN
         Amen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.

EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.
                       ROBIN
         God willing, we may now be safe.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     6.
CONTINUED:
Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.
                         ROBIN
         Come, Peter.    We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
                         PETER
         It is mortal.    Leave me.
                       ROBIN
         Hold on to my shoulder.

Peter shakes him off.
                       PETER
         My mother... my little sister.
         Tell them I love them. Tell them
         I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
                       SARACEN
         His wound is by the heart.    We
         cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.
                       PETER
         Take this to my sister. Swear you
         will protect her for me... Swear
         it, Robin!
                       ROBIN
                (reluctantly)
         I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
                         PETER
         For England.
He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away.
                       SARACEN
         Come now! Do not fail your friend.
         Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.

                                                         7.
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER
Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
                          ROBIN
            Farewell, friend. God speed you
            on your way.
                          SARACEN
            Our way is together. With the
            speed of Allah.
He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor.
                          ROBIN
            I go to England.

                          SARACEN
            Then I go to England.
                           ROBIN
            England?   Why?
                          SARACEN
            You saved my life. I must stay
            with you until I save yours.
                          ROBIN
            Go your own way. I relieve you of
            your obligation.
                          SARACEN
            Only Allah can do that.
                          ROBIN
            And if I don't want you?
                          SARACEN
            You have no choice... unless you
            think you can kill me.
He grins broadly.      Offers his hand.
                          SARACEN
            My name is Aslan.
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
                          ROBIN
            Robin of Locksley. You know a
            short route to England, Aslan?
                                               CUT TO:

                                                      8.
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)
Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND

INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Enough of that din, Remus.    I
         can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
LOCKSLEY.
Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.
                        KENNETH
         My Lord!   Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.
                       DUNCAN
         You must wait... I am sorry you
         were disturbed, Master.
                       KENNETH
                (high anxiety)
         My Lord, please!
                       LOCKSLEY
         It is alright, Duncan.
                (to Kenneth)
         You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
The peasant falls to his knees.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                           9.
CONTINUED:
                       KENNETH
         They've taken my Gwen.    My
         daughter.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Who has taken her?
                       KENNETH
         Men on horses. In masks.
                (touches his wound)
         We tried to stop them. My son is
         dead.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT

Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
him.
                       DUNCAN
         You cannot go alone, Master.      Let
         me ride for help.
                       LOCKSLEY
         That may be too late. Kenneth,
         lead the way.
He kicks his horse into motion.
                         DUNCAN
         Master, stay!    There is an evil
         moon tonight.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Good will overcome, Duncan.      Trust
         in that.
Duncan looks up.    Crosses himself.    Dark clouds race
across the moon.
                                              CUT TO:

EXT. WOODED TRAIL
Kenneth checks the ground.    Locksley waits.
                       KENNETH
         They came this way, my Lord.
                         LOCKSLEY
         Onward then.    What is this place?
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                    10.
CONTINUED:
                       KENNETH
         Nearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.

                       LOCKSLEY
         Steady, man. They are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. Think of
         Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
                       KENNETH
         Druids.
                       LOCKSLEY
         I trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.
                       KENNETH
                (petrified)
         Is it the devil?
                       LOCKSLEY
         If it is, I have some Christian
         steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      11.
CONTINUED:
                       LOCKSLEY
         Gwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
                       DEMON
         Come, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
                        DEMON
         Kill him!   Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Gwen!   Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
                       LOCKSLEY
         In the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.

                                                    12.
CONTINUED:
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.


                        LOCKSLEY
         Nottingham!
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You are an unwelcome surprise,
         Locksley.
                       LOCKSLEY
         The King shall hear of this,
         Nottingham.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         I think not.
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.

                        LOCKSELY
         God help us.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         One day all England will worship
         with us.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Never.
The crone spits venom in his face.
                       DEMON
         I am Mortianna. You will die with
         my name on your lips.
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.

                                                         13.
EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
                         ROBIN
         Home.    Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.

                       ROBIN
         My friend, you have escorted me
         home. I beg you to free yourself
         of your vow. Return with the
         boat. I know how heavy your
         heart must be, this far from your
         family and native land...
                       ASLAN (SARACEN)
         Because I love them so dearly,
         I cannot dishonor them.
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
                       ROBIN
         I thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.

                       ASLAN
         No man controls my destiny.
         Especially not one who attacks
         downwind and stinks of garlic.
Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense.
                       ASLAN
         If our positions were reversed,
         I would have done the same.
         Only I would have succeeded.
He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder.
                       ROBIN
         Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will
         celebrate your honor when we dine
         with my father.

                                                    14.
EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY
CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
                       GISBORNE
         You owe the sheriff three bushels
         of flax.
                       FANNY
         You starve us. First the drought,
         now you take what food we have
         left.
                       GISBORNE
         For starving people, you look
         fat enough.
                       SOLDIER
                (emerging from
                 the hut)
         He's not here, sir. None but the
         woman and children.
                       GISBORNE
                (to Fanny)
         Where is your mate? The man
         they call Little.
                       FANNY
         He died last winter.
                       GISBORNE
         Is that so? We hear he     is very
         much alive. Hiding out     in the
         forest. He probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
                         FANNY
         Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        15.
CONTINUED:
                       FANNY
         No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
         make it worse.
Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
                        GISBORNE
         Seize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
                       GISBORNE
         This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
         Is this how you repay the Sheriff
         for his protection?
                       WULF (BOY)
         Like a wolf protects sheep.
                        FANNY
         I killed it.   We needed the meat.
                       GISBORNE
         Poachers hang. Either he dies or
         you die.
                       WULF
         My mother lies to protect me.
                        FANNY
         No, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.

                       GISBORNE
         You have deprived us of a hunt,
         boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on
Wulf's face.
                       GISBORNE
         The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
                       GISBORNE
         Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
         some pleasure before you die.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       16.
CONTINUED:
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
                         GISBORNE
         Unleash them!

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.
                       ROBIN
         Why must you walk in back of me?

                       ASLAN
         In your land am I not the infidel?
         The unbeliever, the instrument of
         evil?
                       ROBIN
         Our races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.
                       ASLAN
         Then I trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.
                       ROBIN
         For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. Yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.
                       ASLAN
         Those are my burdens.

                       ROBIN
         You speak my language. You have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. I ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
                       ROBIN
         So, I must continue with my
         guesswork. You are highborn?
         Probably... You fell from favor...
         Clearly... Why? You broke the
         law? You were a rival for power?
         ... A woman?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        17.
CONTINUED:
The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
                          ROBIN
            By the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
                          ROBIN
            They say there are Arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. Is
            that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening
sky.
                          ASLAN
            It is close to sunset.
                          ROBIN
            Your people must marry women
            chosen for them by others, right?
No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
                          ROBIN
            Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
            ... Another man's wife?... That's
            it!
                          ASLAN
            Endless clouds. Is there no sun
            in your cursed country?
                          ROBIN
            You dog! You painted old dog!
            What is her name?
                          ASLAN
            Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?!!!
Robin folds his arms.    A standoff.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                       18.

                       ASLAN
         Damn you!... Jasmina.
                         ROBIN
         Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?
                       ASLAN
         Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
         That way.
Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels.
                         ASLAN
         Are you sure?
                       ROBIN
         I would know blindfolded. I'm
         five miles from home... Was she
         worth it?
                       ASLAN
         Worth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.

                       GISBORNE
         You're not playing by    the rules,
         boy. Deer don't climb     trees...
         Perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?
         Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers.
                       ROBIN
         Hold!... I am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome
         that it takes six men to attack
         it.
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.

                       GISBORNE
         Stand back, stranger. This is no
         affair of yours.
                       ROBIN
         Have we treed the devil himself?
         Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
         A truly dangerous animal.
                       GISBORNE
         I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         This is the Sheriff's land.
                       ROBIN
         Wrong. This is my land, and my
         tree. Therefore, whatever is in
         it also belongs to me.
                       GISBORNE
         I grow dangerously tired of your
         wit... Chop it down!
                       ROBIN
         The man who strikes that tree
         dies.
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
                       GISBORNE
         Chop down the hooded fool.
                       ROBIN
                (backing up)
         Perhaps we could discuss this.

The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
                       GISBORNE
         Kill him!
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!   It's time to redeem that
         vow.
                       GISBORNE
         Set the dogs on him!

                                                        20.
CONTINUED:
Aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. Robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. Dead
or not, he soon will be. Robin    unsheathes his sword.
                          ROBIN
            Aslan, get off your damn knees!
            I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.
                          ROBIN
            I hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.
                         ROBIN
            Aslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin
freezes.
                          GISBORNE
            Well, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before I run you
            through.

A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
                          GISBORNE
            Robin of Locksley!
                          ROBIN
            On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray.
He obeys.    Robin raises his sword.
                          GISBORNE
            Please, Locksley! No!
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear.      The man
leaps.

         his scum when they pick on my
         people.
Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
Keeps running.
                       ROBIN
                (to Aslan,
                 furious)
         You worthless savage! You travel
         ten thousand miles to save my life,
         then leave me to be butchered.
                       ASLAN
         I will fulfill my vow when I
         choose.
                       ROBIN
         Which does not include prayer
         times, meal times, or any time
         I'm outnumbered six to one!!
                       ASLAN
         You whine like a mule.   You are
         still alive.
                       ROBIN
         Barely.
Aslan examines Robin's wound.   Dismissive.
                       ASLAN
         A flesh wound. Why did you let
         their leader go?
                       ROBIN
         After six years of the stench of
         death, I have no stomach for
         needless blood on my hands.
Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
                       ROBIN
         Have no fear, boy.
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
                       ASLAN
                (laughing)
         The conquering hero returns.
                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                        ROBIN
         Ha!   It was you he was scared of.
Aslan's humor is infectious.     Robin's anger relents.
                       ROBIN
         Come, my strange friend. Beyond
         that hill lies the prettiest
         little castle in all Christendom.
         Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
                       ASLAN
         With feather pillows?
                       ROBIN
         With feather pillows. Warm and
         soft like Jasmina's embrace.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.   Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.
                         ROBIN
         Father!    Hello!
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.


CLOSE - MEDALLION
round the corpse's neck.   The Locksley crest.
                        ROBIN
         Noooooo!
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
Aslan looks on.
                       ROBIN
         I should have been here.
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... Duncan.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        23.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
                (shaking him)
         Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you
         cut him down?
                       DUNCAN
         Master Robin, is it you? A
         miracle. I thought God had
         abandoned us.
                       ROBIN
         You left my father to hang like
         a common thief, carrion for the
         crows.

                       ASLAN
         Easy... Look at him.
Duncan steps into the moonlight.    His face crudely-
scarred.
                       ROBIN
         What has happened?
                       DUNCAN
         They say they captured him
         worshipping with the Druids. He
         signed a confession before the
         Bishop of Hereford.
                       ROBIN
         Did they have witnesses?
                       DUNCAN
         Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.
         The Bishop decreed all the Locksley
         lands forfeit.
                       ROBIN
         Did you believe the charges?
                       DUNCAN
         Not even when they took my eyes.
                       ROBIN
         Who did this to you, Duncan?
                       DUNCAN
         Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff
         looking on.
Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    Stares into
the night in silent rage.

                                                         24.
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like
battlements.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving,
stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.
                       SENTRY
         Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to
         be disturbed.
                        GISBORNE
         Away, fool.
He shoves the Sentry aside.

EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
covers up.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Who bade you cover up?
He smashes his fist into his chair.   She timidly
uncovers.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, I trust you justify your
         intrusion with news of profound
         value.
His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
ness.
                       GISBORNE
         I met a hooded man today. He bade
         me warn you not to harm his
         people.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         His name?
                       GISBORNE
         Robin of Locksley.

                      NOTTINGHAM
         Ha! The prodigal son returns. He
         is a whelp. This girl could best
         him.
                       GISBORNE
         This whelp bested five of my men
         in the blink of an eye.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Your men were probably drunk.   Yet
         you survived, cousin?
Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. MORTIANNA.
                       GISBORNE
                (stunned)
         You brought her here?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Quiet!
The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dice -- Runes.
She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
move. A connoisseur.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change the seat of power.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         London?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change it.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Move the capitol to Nottingham?
         Excellent. How?

         Ally with royal blood.

         Put someone on the throne and rule
         through him? Who?
                       MORTIANNA
         That is not revealed.
The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.      Mounting
intensity.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ally with royal blood. What else
         do you see?
                         MORTIANNA
         Armies.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Whose?
                      MORTIANNA
         Yours. Men and weaponry in great
         numgers.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         And victory?
                       MORTIANNA
         Much blood will be spilled.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Whose?


CLOSE SHOT
A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol.
Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
again. Again the grinning skull.

BACK TO SCENE
The tray smashes to the ground.      The hag runs at
Gisborne.
                       MORTIANNA
         Who have you seen?!
She shakes him.    Screams spittle in his face.

                       GISBORNE
                (freaked)
         No one. I have seen no one.
                          MORTIANNA
         You lie!     A man... A painted man.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What is wrong?
                       MORTIANNA
         I have seen my death.
She whimpers.   Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.

                       MORTIANNA
         The painted man. He haunts my
         dreams.
                       GISBORNE
         Locksley has a companion. A dark-
         skinned foreigner. He had the
         marked skin of Islam.
Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    Eyes wide with
terror.
                          MORTIANNA
         Kill them!     Kill them!
She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.    He
caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin. Prove to Locksley that
         your survival was his last mistake.

                       MORTIANNA
                (frantic)
         And the painted man! Kill him.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Kill them both.
He continues to stroke her.    Her trembling subsides.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have done well, Mortianna.
         Exceedingly well. No one shall
         harm you, I swear it.
Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young
girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the
girl's hand.

Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down
viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses
         will seem soft, like an angel's.
                (to Mortianna)
         Take her. You have earned her.
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   Drags her
away.
                       GISBORNE
         It is madness bringing the hag
         here.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For
         in madness, there is great power.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN
Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees.
Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave.
Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
                       ROBIN
         Our last words in this world were
         spoken in anger. He called the
         Crusades a foolish quest, said it
         was vanity to force other men to
         our religion. He was right.
                (looks to Aslan,
                 then back to the
                 grave)
         Please forgive me, Father.
                       DUNCAN
         He loved you till the end, young
         master. He never gave up hope of
         your return.
                       ROBIN
         I failed him. I should have been
         here at his side.
                       DUNCAN
         You must leave, head north to
         safety. Gisborne will surely seek
         revenge.
                       ROBIN
         Leave me.

         I know what you're thinking. But
         one man can achieve nothing
         against so many. You would need
         an army.
                         ROBIN
         Leave me.
                         ASLAN
         Come, friend.
He leads the old man away.
                                           CUT TO:


GRAVE SIDE - LATER
Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side.
Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a
stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
                       DUNCAN
         He still stands vigil?
                         ASLAN
         Like a rock.
Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
                       DUNCAN
         A curse on the Saracens! Were it
         not for their ungodly ways, he
         would never have left. This would
         never have happened.

                       ASLAN
         It surprises me that one who
         curses others so readily has lived
         so long.
                       DUNCAN
         I do not recognize the style of
         your voice, friend. Are you
         Irish? A Cornishman?
                         ASLAN
         Er... no.
                       DUNCAN
         What manner of name is Aslan then?
                       ASLAN
         A fine Saracen name.

He chokes in shock.   Spitting bread.

         Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I
         take no offense.
                (glances at Robin)
         By the prophet! What is the man
         doing?
Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   Aslan runs to
him.

                         ASLAN
         Wait!
Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm.
Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.
                       ROBIN
         I swear by my own blood. I will
         not rest until I have restored my
         father's name.
                (a whisper)
         ... Or until I am dead.

EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY
Ooze sucks at feet.   The three men stomp through mud and
rain.
                       ROBIN
         We make a fine army, do we not,
         Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and
         a fool.
                       ASLAN
         A fine, wet army. I have never
         witnessed a storm of such duration.
         When does summer come to this
         land?
                       ROBIN
         This is summer.

           vow.
They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched
mansion.
                         ROBIN
           You despair too soon, Aslan. We
           shall find food and shelter here
           among friends.

                         ASLAN
           What is this place?
                         ROBIN
           Peter's home. It is nearly seven
           years since we left here together.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Robin pounds on the door.    A hatch opens.     An OLD WOMAN's
face.
                         OLD WOMAN
           No beggars!
The hatch slams shut.    Robin pounds again.
                         ROBIN
           Open up!

A pause.   The hatch slides back.
                         ROBIN
           Tell the mistress of the house
           that Robin of Locksley is at her
           door.
                         OLD WOMAN
           Her ladyship is not at home.
She slams the hatch again.    Robin jams in his hand.
                         ROBIN
           Aagh!
He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           32.

                          ROBIN
            Is the child Marian at home?
                          OLD WOMAN
            Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.
            Remove that hand.
Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked
door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly
the hatch slams.
                          ASLAN
            The hospitality here is as warm as
            the weather.

They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.
                          OLD WOMAN
            Leave your weapons.
The three start forward.       Her bony finger points at
Robin.
                            OLD WOMAN
            Just you.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
The hall. Deer heads.        Boar heads.   Portraits of
ancestors.
                            OLD WOMAN
            Wait here.
He waits.    CREAKING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony.

                            GIRL
            Who are you?
Dim lighting.    Robin cannot make out who it is.
                          ROBIN
            I am Robin of Locksley.
                             GIRL
            You lie.     Robin is dead.
                          ROBIN
            I may meet my maker soon from lack
            of sustenance. But for now I am
            real enough.

                       GIRL
         Step into the light.    Turn around.
                       ROBIN
         By heaven, am I to dance next?
         Who are you?
                       GIRL
         I am the maid Marian.
                       ROBIN
         Then show yourself, child.     For we
         knew each other well.
                       GIRL
         With the king away, these are
         lawless times. There are outlaws
         villainous enough to kidnap and
         ransom a relative of his.
                       ROBIN
         You know I am not one of them.
         Besides, I am sworn to protect
         you.
                       GIRL
                (laughs)
         Protect me? Robin of Locksley was
         nothing but a spoiled bully.
                       ROBIN
         Allow that years of war and prison
         may change a man. Step forward,
         Marian, so I may see how you have
         changed.

She moves into the light... Fat.     Rotten teeth.   Ugly as
sin.
                       ROBIN
         Er... the years have been kind.
                       GIRL
         Thank you. Now remove yourself
         from this household.
A figure steps behind Robin.    Sticks a sword in his back.
                       GIRL
                (turning away)
         As you can see, we are already
         well protected.
                         ROBIN
         Wait, Marian!    ...ouch!
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                         34.
CONTINUED:
The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man
-- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
                        ROBIN
          You are truly courageous against
          an unarmed man.
The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps.
Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the
floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts,
drawing a dagger.
Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head.
Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.


OUTSIDE
The SOUND of the fight indoors.   Aslan hurls himself at
the door. It doesn't give.

INSIDE
Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts.     The
horns get shorter. Robin retreats.
Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops.
Robin wrenches off the mask.
Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just
in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's
crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young
woman stands over Robin.
                        YOUNG WOMAN
          As she was saying, we have
          no need of your protection.
Robin croaks through clenched teeth.
                       ROBIN
          Marian.
                                             CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN
Liquid tumbles into a goblet.   The three men at a table
in the kitchen.

CONTINUED:
The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves.
Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin --
"Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An
impish grin.
                       MARIAN
         I trust Lord Locksley has
         recovered from his indisposition.
Aslan laughs.   Robin glares.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through
clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in
her voice.
                       MARIAN
         Why would he wish me to be
         protected by the boy who burned
         my hair when I was a child?
                       ROBIN
         We were together five terrible
         years in a Saracen prison.
                       MARIAN
         How do I know you didn't abandon
         him there to save your own skin.
Robin hands her Peter's ring.   She is shocked.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I'm sorry.

                       MARIAN
         I will forward your condolences
         to my mother.
She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her.
                       ROBIN
         On my return, I found my father
         dead. The Sheriff denounced him
         as a Druid and took our lands.
                       MARIAN
         The people fear the Druids so much
         they'd believe anything.
         Nottingham would have me burned at
         the stake as a witch if he thought
         he could possess my property.

                       ROBIN
         Why do you not join your mother
         in London? You would be safer
         there.
                       MARIAN
         I will not retreat.     Besides, I
         have no interest in    life at court.
         Gossip-mongering and    currying
         favor. Here I am my     own person.
                       ROBIN
         The you must allow me to be your
         guardian.

                       MARIAN
         I do not need a guardian.
She turns to face him.   Streaming tears.
                       MARIAN
         My brother is dead. You cannot
         take his place.
Robin grabs and holds her.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I don't want to replace
         him.
                       MARIAN
         What do you want?
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.

                       MARIAN
         This is wrong.
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
                       ASLAN
         Robin! The old man hears horses.
         Approaching fast.
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
                       ASLAN
         Twenty or more. In battle armor.
                       MARIAN
         Soldiers coming here?     Is this
         your protection?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                      37.

                       ROBIN
         I killed some of the Sheriff's
         men. I fear I have placed you in
         danger.
                       MARIAN
         I can take care of myself. There
         are horses in the stable. Go!
Aslan runs into the stables.
                       ROBIN
         I'm not leaving.
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
soldiers.
                        MARIAN
         Stop them!   They're stealing my
         horses!
                       ROBIN
         Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
         ride?
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
                        ROBIN
         He can ride.
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
                       GISBORNE
         You have been sheltering outlaws,
         Lady Marian.
                       MARIAN
         They're thieves, you imbecile.
         Bring back my horses, or the
         Sheriff will know of your
         cowardice.
Gisborne knows she is lying.

                       GISBORNE
         You're lucky he didn't steal your
         virtue too.
                (to his men)
         A crown to the man who brings me
         Locksley's head.
He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs
Marian's hair.
                       SOLDIER
         A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
                        MARIAN
         Kiss this!

She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    Jabs
the blade into his wrist.
                       MARIAN
         Try me again, if you want to
         leave a hand behind.
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
                                           CUT TO:
EXT. STREAM
Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
backs away.
                       ROBIN
         Damn you, animal!
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
                       ASLAN
         Treat it like a woman.
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
die.
                       ASLAN
         Have you never had a woman?
         Gently, man. Soothe it!

                       ROBIN
         Of course I've had a woman!
         Come on, pretty one.
He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward.
                        ASLAN
         Softly.   With your knees.
                        ROBIN
         I know!   I know!
The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.

                         ROBIN
         Easy, easy.
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
                         ROBIN
         I love you!
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
                       GISBORNE
                (yelling)
         Robin of the Hood! Son of the
         devil worshipper.
                       ROBIN
         What is your pleasure, Gisborne?

                       GISBORNE
         It was I who strung your father's
         corpse to the castle gate. My
         pleasure will be in doing the same
         to you.
                       ROBIN
         You survived one meeting.    Our next
         will be your last.
                       GISBORNE
         Your father died a coward, cursing
         your name and squealing like a
         stuck pig.
                         ROBIN
         That's a lie!

Incensed, he is losing his judgement.

                   (shouts)
            Come, Robin! He is trying to
            anger you into a trap.
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
follow.

Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
                          ROBIN
            We have lost them. I'll lame this
            mare if I ask her to go any farther.
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
Robin watches, curious.

SCOPE POV
Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.

The soldiers are close!

BACK TO SCENE
He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself.    Then
realizes they are still in the distance.

         No.    Arab science.
He replaces the tube in his pouch.
                       ASLAN
         How did your uneducated
         kind ever take Jerusalem?
                        ROBIN
         God knows!

Aslan laughs.   Robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
                       ROBIN
         We can lose them in the forest.
                       DUNCAN
         Sherwood is haunted, Master.
                       ROBIN
         Either we take our chances
         with the ghosts, or become
         ghosts ourselves.
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
looks back.
                       ROBIN
         They're not following.

Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
                       GISBORNE
         Come on, damn you! There are
         only three of them.
                       SOLDIER
         It's not the men we fear, sir.
Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones.    Aslan draws his
sword.
                       DUNCAN
         Banshees. They say they fly in
         your mouth and suck you dry of
         blood before you can scream.
He wraps his scarf over his mouth.

                         ROBIN
         Be quiet!    Listen.
WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
                       ASLAN
         Allah protect us from the evil
         spirits.
Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points.
                        ROBIN
         Behind you!
Aslan slashes out, futilely.
                         ROBIN
         No, there!    And there!
Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up.
                       ASLAN
         Cease your mad laughing.     I can
         feel them.
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.
                       ROBIN
         Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
         child's toy put to good use. You
         scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
                       WILL SCARLET
                (singing)
         Ring around the rosie!
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!
Aslan makes no move to intervene.

                                                       43.
CONTINUED:
The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall
         down. Beg for mercy, rich man.
                       ROBIN
         I beg of no man. Which of you
         scum has guts enough to face
         me man to man?
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Yeah, bollocks, mate.

Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         What are ya, m'old cock?
                       ROBIN
         Er... Robin...
He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
                        ROBIN
         ...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are
         you?
                        JOHN LITTLE
         John Little.   Bestman o' the
         woods.
                        ROBIN
         Bestman?   You lead this rabble?
                       WILL SCARLET
         We waste time. Tax him.
                        ROBIN
         Tax?   For what?
                       WILL SCARLET
         For passage through Sherwood.
                       ROBIN
         I will pay no tax. Besides, I
         have nothing but my cloak and
         my sword.

                       WILL SCARLET
         A man who travels with two servants
         and claims he's without money, is
         either a fool or a liar.
Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something
CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And this one is a liar.
                (he bites the metal)
         Ahah! Gold!
The men cheer.   John snatches the medallion back from
Will.
                       ROBIN
         That is sacred to me.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Sacred to us too, mush. This
         here'll feed us for a bloomin'
         month.
Robin draws his sword.
                       ROBIN
         You will have to fight me for it.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         I'd love to, mate.
He grins hugely.   A boy pushes his way through the throng.
                         WULF
         Wait, father!    I know him.
                       ROBIN
         This man is your father? Tell him
         how I saved your hide from the
         Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves
         some gratitude, I believe.
He reaches for the medallion.    John pulls it away.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Naw ya don't, laddie.
                       WILL SCARLET
         You must be Robin of Locksley.
         The blackguard who abandoned us to
         Nottingham's plundering.

                       WULF
         Be careful, Father. He fights
         like a demon. He walloped six o'
         Sheriff's men?
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Is that so?
Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he
lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.
Bends it into a pretzel.
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!

Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
stomach. Robin folds.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Oh dear! The little rich boy is
         lost for words. Thanks for the
         taxes, Locksley.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         And for the laughs.
The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
the tree. Will administers one final kick before
leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
at Aslan.
                       ROBIN
         Son of an Arab whore! Once again
         your assistance was invaluable.

                       ASLAN
         You seemed more in danger of losing
         your pride than your life.
                       DUNCAN
         I recognized some of the voices.
         Many were from your father's farms.
                       ASLAN
         Your avenging army, my friend.
                        ROBIN
         That rabble?
                       ASLAN
         All they need is a leader.

         They have a leader.   A very large
         one.

         Defeat him and they will follow
         you.
                       ROBIN
         Allah has taken your brains.
                       DUNCAN
         I hear the voice of a spoiled
         child, Master Robin. I suggest
         you cease your brave talk of
         revenge and flee to the north.
                       ROBIN
         You, too? You expect me to
         fight that behemoth?
                       DUNCAN
         Your father would expect you to
         act like a man.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
                       ROBIN
         This is my bridge. No one crosses
         without paying tax.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Just bugger off, mate, huh?
                       ROBIN
         If you wish to cross, it will
         cost you a gold medallion.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff
         for one day?
                       WILL SCARLET
         If he's in a hurry to end his
         mortal misery, help him.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         You don't have the courage to
         face me again, John Little? Or
         should I call you 'Little John'?
John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the
bridge.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
         nuther good wallopin'?
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.
Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits,
grinning.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
                       WILL SCARLET
         Don't fool with him. Get him!

John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.
John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank.
No sign.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       JOHN LITTLE
         Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave
         'un.
Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp
onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might.
John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Help!   Cain't bloody swim.
He submerges again.   Robin pulls his head above water.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?

The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the
surface.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?
                         JOHN LITTLE
         Yes!
                        ROBIN
         Good.   Now put your feet down.
John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water
only reaches his chest.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         Pay me the tax.
A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid
         rock.
He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he
swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and
fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.

He spits black objects from his mouth.      Dead bees.   John
grins.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Real honey.
He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
Aslan.
                          ASLAN
            With regrets, I decline.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            An Englishman's mead not bleedin'
            good enough for ya?
                          ASLAN
            On the contrary. I thank you,
            but my faith prevents me from
            partaking in such enjoyments.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Your bloody loss, mate.
He swigs.    Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks
heartily.    Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            What is it, boy? Speak up!

            C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put
            hair on your bloomin' chest.
Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant.       He turns
green and runs. His father cracks up.
                          ROBIN
            Tell me about your men, John.
John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree

Proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
                         ROBIN
         No, Bull.    Save it for the ladies.
Drunken laughter.    Robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.
                       ROBIN
         Your name, friend?
The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to
respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a
comprehensible word.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         That be Hal Brownwell, but the
         lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.
The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up
at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his
tormentors.
                       ROBIN
         Hold! Hal, you have the face and
         hands of a farmer. I wager you
         are a strong and honest man, and
         I'd be glad to have you at my side
         in a fight. The next man who makes
         light of you will have to answer
         to me.
There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects

                       LITTLE JOHN
         What in bloody blazes'd ya have
         us do?
                       ROBIN
         Your ghosts will only keep his
         men at bay so long, my friend.
         Soon the Sheriff will hunt you
         down and hang you. You must
         fight back.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We show as much as a toe outside
         the forest, they'll slaughter us
         like bleedin' sheep.
                       ROBIN
         We must organize. Win by guile.
                      LITTLE JOHN
         'We'? Ya lookin' to join us,
         matie?
                        ROBIN
         No.   To lead you.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Ha! I would never be led by the
         son of a Druid.
                       ROBIN
         There are many here who knew my
         father to be a kind and generous
         man. I doubt that in their hearts
         they believe him capable of such a
         horror.
Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    Robin turns
to Will.

                       ROBIN
         What is your name, friend?
                       WILL SCARLET
         Count me not a friend, Locksley.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will.
         The man's our guest.
Will gets up.   Angrily pushes his way out of the group.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im
         no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.

                       ROBIN
         He is right to distrust me. I am
         a rich man's son. I have done no
         honest labor. But today I am as
         poor as any of you. Nottingham
         has stolen all that I own. And
         when I killed Gisborne's men, I,
         too, became an outlaw.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all,
         mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish
         agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army?
         Ya must be bloody jokin'.
                        ROBIN
         We can win.   And I believe we will.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood,
         but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give
         ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz
         tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky!
         Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack
         that blasted noble head in two.
Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long
draught of mead.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE
A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose
of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around
him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with
rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess.
Robin sits, brooding.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       53.

                       ASLAN
                (gloomily)
         I have led you wrong. This is no
         army. These men live like dogs.
                         ROBIN
         English dogs.    They can learn.
                        ASLAN
         Learn what?   To build kennels?
He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan
is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side.
The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously
hung-over.

                       ROBIN
         Too much mead, old friend.    What
         day is it?
                       DUNCAN
         Sunday, I believe.
                       ROBIN
         Good. Do they still give alms
         to the poor at the mass?
                       DUNCAN
         They do. These days the need for
         mercy is greater than ever.
                       ROBIN
         Then I must ask you a favor.
EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY

Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham.
Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin,
dressed as Duncan.

EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing
stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.
                         GUARD
         Hey, you!
Robin keeps going.   A hand clasps his shoulder.    Spins
him 'round.

                       GUARD
         Do I know you?
Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   The Guard
sniffs his soiled hand.
                       GUARD
         My God, you stink!
                       ROBIN
         Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm
         always falling down.
                        GUARD
         Yeech!   Get away from me.

He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away,
hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on
the wall.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass
window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD,
bedecked in ermine.
                       BISHOP
         We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on
         all your people, but most
         especially on our noble Lord
         Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom
         to guide and protect our glorious
         city.
Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega-
tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
                       BISHOP
         Grant him also the strength to
         bring to justice the lawless men
         who threaten its safety. Help
         him to stamp out the curse of the
         dread Druids who would seize from
         us our children, even as wolves
         steal the lambs from their mothers.
The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the
poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children.
Among them, Robin.
The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are
galvanized. Begging hands reach out.

         3.   Pity, fine sir.
         4.   For my baby.
         5.   Etc.
The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble.
Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some
coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her
wrist.
                       ROBIN
         Alms for a blind man. For one
         who cannot see your beauty.

                       MARIAN
                (recognizing him)
         This is dangerous.
                       ROBIN
         So you care for my safety?
                       MARIAN
         No, for mine. I do not wish
         to be seen with an outlaw.
                       ROBIN
         Under the Sheriff's law, that's
         a badge of pride.
                       MARIAN
         He's put a price on your head.
                       ROBIN
         How much?

                       MARIAN
         A hundred gold pieces.
                       ROBIN
         Is that all? I have not annoyed
         him enough. Soon he will offer
         ten thousand.
                       MARIAN
         For ten thousand I would turn you
         in myself.
                (glances back at
                 the Sheriff)
         Nottingham is mounting an army.
                       ROBIN
         How do you know?

         He has rounded up every blacksmith
         in the county. He has them holed
         up in the castle making swords and
         armor.
                       ROBIN
         What is he planning?
                       MARIAN
         I don't know, but there's no limit
         to the man's ambitions.
                (as Sheriff heads
                 towards them)
         Go!

                       ROBIN
         If you need me, I will be with
         the woodsmen. Send for me as
         'Robin Hood.'
                        MARIAN
         Robin!   Do something for me.

         What?
                        MARIAN
         Take a bath.
                       ROBIN
         Care to join me?
With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham
arrives.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         You shine like the sun, my lady.
He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle.
Kisses it.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have been meeting with young
         Robin of Locksley.
                (as she tries to
                 hide her shock)
         My cousin tells me the knave
         deprived you of some horses.
                       MARIAN
                (recovering)
         Yes. A most disagreeable
         experience.

         I deeply regret it, and I promise
         you he will be brought to justice.
         For subjecting you to such
         treatment, I will hang him from
         the walls with his own entrails.
That gleam of insanity.   Robin watches from a distance.
                       MARIAN
         I would like to see that, my lord.
The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         My dear, a woman of your refinement
         is not safe living alone. If you
         would consent to bring your
         household within the city walls,
         I could give your needs my most
         personal attention.
                       MARIAN
         I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from
         the heart, but for now I prefer to
         stay in my family's ancestral home.
         My cousin, King Richard, will be
         deeply moved to hear of your
         concern for my welfare.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Alas, the King has many enemies
         both abroad and at home. I fear
         for his safe return.
                       MARIAN
         Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will
         return. When he does, he will
         wish to reward his faithful subjects.
The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian
deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards
a side door.
                       BEGGAR
                (Robin)
         Alms, my lord.
Nottingham makes to shove the man aside. With a swift
move, the beggar grabs the Sheriff in a headlock.
Slides Nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags
him out of sight.

         Remember young Robin of Locksley,
         Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your

         chance to right your wrongs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I'm listening.
                       ROBIN
         From this day forward you will
         cease to tax my people. You will
         renounce the charges against my
         father, and you will return his

         here again.
A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them.

         Then it will begin..
Gisborne yells orders.   Robin hurls Nottingham against
the wall.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY

Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides
through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks
him. A sure shot.
Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and
stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly
into the air.
                       MARIAN
                (innocently)
         Please excuse my clumsiness.
Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks
the guard who hasseled him into the wall.

Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.

                       ROBIN

         Aslan, if I didn't know better,

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL
The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Starve them out. Slaughter their

EXT. HAMLET - DAY
A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round
up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.
                       FARMER
         Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the
         sow. She's with young 'uns. The

Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings.    A contingent
of woodsmen confronts Robin.
                       WILL SCARLET
         You brought this misery on us,
         Locksley. We can barely feed
         ourselves.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody
         pot to piss in.
                       ROBIN
         Then we shall take from him and
         his rich friends.

This provokes a barrage of protests.   The men are angry.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Brave talk, Locksley. I say we
         take the rich boy in.
Murmurs of general agreement.
                       ROBIN
         Will, do you think the Sheriff will
         give everything back after I am
         gone?
                       WILL SCARLET
         He will give us the reward, and
         our pardons.
                       ROBIN
         Alright, Will. You can take me
         in on one condition. You must
         fight me. You may use the Sheriff's
         horse and arm yourself as you
         please. I will fight on foot.
         Unarmed.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Unarmed?
                       ROBIN
         If you lose, you will accept me
         as your leader. If you win, you
         may take me in. Dead or alive.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Dead, Locksley.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY (LATER)
Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his
cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.
Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves,
while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan.
Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.
                       ASLAN
         This man has true purpose.    He
         means to kill you.
                       DUNCAN
         And you have given him the means.
                       WULF
         Will is ruthless, Robin.    Guard
         your back.
                       ROBIN
         I am grateful for your concern,
         friends, but I have to prove to
         them it is possible to overcome
         unequal odds.
                (shouts)
         I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.

Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.
Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
Douses his face. Yells at Will.

                       ROBIN
         Come on, you little piss pot.
         Do your worst!
Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his
ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.
                       ROBIN
         The horse is smarter than you are,
         Will.
Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks
and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges.
Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.

                        ROBIN
         Here, Will!   You aim like a girl,
         Will!
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
                       ROBIN
         Thank the Lord you are not endowed
         like Bull.

The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is
about to strike.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,
         eh?
Overpowered, Will relents.   With a defiant glance, he
skulks away.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya got us by the short and curlies,
         Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya
         got to bleedin' say.

Robin scans the faces.     He has their attention.
                          ROBIN
            Nottingham has taken from us
            everything we own. Now we are
            going to start taking from him.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna
            do that?
                          ROBIN
            We are going to tax him.
                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his
telescope raised.
                          ASLAN
            Here they come.
                          ROBIN
            How many?
                           ASLAN
            Two wagons.   Twenty escort.
                           ROBIN
            Twenty?   They usually have five.
He grabs the telescope.

SCOPE POV
A phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and   a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne
commands the   escort.
BACK TO SCENE
                          ROBIN
            This is no ordinary convoy.
Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
                          BULL
            'ow many?
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                    65.

                       ROBIN
         Er, about ten.
                (then, to Aslan)
         Why scare them? They can't count
         anyway.
                       ASLAN
         And they call me the barbarian.
                         ROBIN
         Let's go.
Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.
BACK ON ROADWAY
Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.

CONTINUED:
Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts
from inside.
                       ROBIN
         Surrender your weapons. I give
         you my word you shall go free.
In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.

                       ROBIN
         Ah, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,
panic. Drowning rats.
The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
                                               CUT TO:
COUNTRYSIDE
Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The
lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around.
Cheers of celebration.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (awestruck)
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         This treasure had a purpose.     We
         must find out what.
He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart.
The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
                        ROBIN
         Get off him.   He's a man of the
         cloth.
Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet.
Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.

                       FRIAR
         The Lord's blessing on you, kind
         sir. These sinners were attempting
         to steal these libations destined
         for the monks of St. Catherine's.
He indicates his cargo of barrels.
                       ROBIN
         It appears to me, Reverend Friar,
         that many of the libations have
         found their way into your own
         esteemed person.
Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.

                       FRIAR
         A thousand pardons, sir, but duty
         beckons. I must hasten on.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing the bridle)
         A moment, my reverend friend. You
         travel with poor company when you
         travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
                         BULL
         Aye, tax him.
This sparks a chorus of comments.
                       ROBIN
         My men are thirsty and have much
         to celebrate.
                       FRIAR
         Lord bless me, sir, are these your
         men? I had mistook them for
         common thieves. Kindly step
         aside.
                       ROBIN
         Surely the Lord has the charity to
         spare a few barrels to good
         Christian men.
The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
                       FRIAR
         Well, sir, if you wish them to
         share in the good Lord's brew...
Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
Smites Robin with it.

                       FRIAR
         ... you must best me for it.
Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
                         FRIAR
         Giddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.

                       ROBIN
         You leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
                       FRIAR
         Protect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.
The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
                       FRIAR
         Confess that Friar Tuck is a
         better, holier, and braver man
         than thou art, knave.

                        ROBIN
         Never!   Whoomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar
         Tuck.
Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls.
Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes
the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
                       ROBIN
         Yield yourself!
He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the
ground.

Tuck holds up a hand in surrender.    Robin eases off.

                (feeling his head)
         Thank you, Lord, for teaching me
         humility.
                       ROBIN
         Well, Friar Tuck. We have need
         of an honest man of God, to
         minister to these men and their
         families. What do you say?

The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the
grinning Saracen.
                       FRIAR
         I'd rather roast in hell.
He punches Robin in the gut.

FRIAR TUCK
strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating
profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.

         Giddyup, Friar.

He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women
and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
                       ROBIN
         What do you say now, Tuck?    Here
         are the meek of the earth.
Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little
hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord moves in mysterious

With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan   leaps INTO VIEW.
Stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. The
Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain
Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mouth,
Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A
butcher checking meat.
                       ROBIN
         I strongly advise you to talk.
         He hasn't eaten in weeks.

                       CAPTAIN
                (rising terror)
         What does he want?
                       ROBIN
         You.
                       CAPTAIN
         For Godsakes, get him off me!
                       ROBIN
                (very deliberately)
         No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.
         ... How about this other one?...
         Fatter, yes... more meat.
The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his
attention to him. With one swing   of his sword, Aslan
slices through the man's ropes.   Drags him to his feet.
Little John runs over.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (urgent)
         No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'
         men.
                       ROBIN
         I cannot stop him, John. Besides,
         if they will not tell what they
         know, then they must pay the price.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Kill 'em aye, but not like this.
         'Tain't Christian.
Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan
has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then
silence.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                     72.

The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his
lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates
wildly at the Captain.
                       CAPTAIN
         What does he say?
                       ROBIN
         Well, roughly, he says that he
         doesn't care for the way your
         friend tastes, and he wants you.
                       CAPTAIN
         No, God, no! I'll talk. Just
         keep him away. Keep him away!

BEHIND WAGON
Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth
and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them
lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed,
except that he's missing a glove.

INT. WOODSMAN'S HUT - NIGHT
The walls shake with Little John's laughter.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Sure changed the color of 'is
         britches, didn't 'e?
                       ROBIN
         Thanks to our cannibal friend.
Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of
venison.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
                       BULL
         Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold
         north o' the border?
                       ROBIN
         To hire mercenaries. The Celts
         are savage tribesmen, trained
         to kill from birth.

         What does 'e want wi 'em?
                       ROBIN
         Since he also has every Smith
         in the country working in his
         castle, we can assume he is
         planning a little war.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Agin' who?

                       ASLAN
         England.

INT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT
Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon
factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the
smithy's fires.
A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no
heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white-
hot.
                       GISBORNE
         We were ambushed. In Sherwood
         Forest.
Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Spanish steel, cousin. So much
         stronger than our native blades.
         Any losses?
                       GISBORNE
         All the men are gone.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Yet again you are the sole
         survivor, cousin? Interesting.
         And the gold?
                       GISBORNE
         Well, it er... disappeared.

The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time.

         Robin Hood?

         They were woodsmen, dressed in

         Robin Hood.
He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, we must be strong. We
         cannot allow this outlaw to make
         fools of us.
Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
belly.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And I cannot allow a lieutenant
         to fail me.
                (turning to the
                 horrified smithy)
         It is indeed fine steel.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax
wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal
pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the
villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed.
Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.
                       FRIAR
         God bless you, sir.
                       VILLAGER
         An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar.
         They says as 'ow none o' the
         Sheriff's cronies dare go within
         miles o' Sherwood for fear o'
         havin' their pockets pinched.

         Ah, the good Lord giveth and the
         good Lord taketh away.
                       OLD WOMAN

Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's
mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his
jug in greeting.
                       FRIAR
         Good morrow, brothers.

EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
Marian jumps down.
                       MARIAN
                (to Robin)
         How dare you!
                       ROBIN
         Good morning, Lady Marian.
In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
                       MARIAN
         You send men to drag me from my
         home in the middle of the night,
         like some slave girl? Is this
         the way the famous Robin Hood
         treats a lady?
                       ROBIN
         Ah well... er, let me finish this
         bath you wished me to take. Then
         I'll explain.
                       MARIAN
         I demand an explanation right now!
                       ROBIN
         If you will be patient, I could
         spare your propriety by...

         I will decide when my propriety

         As you wish.

He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her.
She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you expose yourself to
         me?!
She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water.
Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
                       BULL
         The big 'un did the same to me.


EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.
                       LITTLE JOHN
                (to Wulf)
         Right m'lad. Let's see how close
         you can git to that bugger.
Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps
Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
         Never seen nuthin' like it in
         my bloomin' life.

Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
                       MARIAN
         This better be damned important.
Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws
back the lid. Marian is speechless.
                       ROBIN
         Nottingham robs the poor. We
         rob Nottingham and give back to
         the poor.

                        MARIAN
          Do you think he's going to let
          you get away with all this? The
          man is without mercy. He will
          annihilate you.
                        ROBIN
          Somebody has to take a stand.
                        MARIAN
          You're taking a stand with the
          lives of these people. These
          young ones.
A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's.
Is there a hint of concern for him also?
                        MARIAN
          What do you want from me?
                        ROBIN
          Nottingham was sending this gold
          to buy reinforcements from the
          Celtic tribesmen. We need to
          warn King Richard.
                        MARIAN
          Nottingham would not dare
          challenge the King.
                        ROBIN
          The King is not in England to
          be challenged, is he? While he
          is away, he may lose his country.
                 (Marian masks her
                  concern)
          You are Richard's cousin. You
          can get word to him. He would
          believe you.
                        MARIAN
          Now you want me to participate
          in your folly?
A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering.

         bellyaching.
                       DUNCAN
         Hah! I have endured more hardship
         in my lifetime than any man here.
Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper.
                       ROBIN
         Don't tell him I told you, but
         he may be useful to you. There
         is no one to whom I would rather
         entrust your safety.
                       MARIAN
         Duncan, you are most welcome.
Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
A globule of red liquid.    A signet ring.   Marian seals

INT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY
The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the
Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office.

         My dear, I could not vouch for
         her safety. The journey is fraught
         with danger.
                       MARIAN
         I appreciate your concern, my
         Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished

An informal council of war.   Robin uses a stick in the
dirt.

                       ROBIN
         We have to be ready to move camp
         at any time. The only way we can
         be attacked is from the Nottingham
         Road. We hide lookouts in the
         trees, here and here. If they
         see soldiers, they shoot warning
         arrows. Whistles by day, fire
         by night.
Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.

Fanny Little writhes in agony.    John rushes in.   Tuck

         The child comes early.
Fanny screams.   John kneels beside her, taking her head.

         I am doing all I can.
Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the
blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming
creatures.
                       ASLAN
         By Allah, leeches!
He starts to pull the parasites off.    Tuck jumps at him.

         Get away from her!
Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.

         Blood is like air. If she loses
         blood, she and the child will die.
John is paralyzed with confusion.    Tuck appeals to Robin.

Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the
blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.

                       ASLAN
         If you do not listen to me, she
         will certainly die. And the
         child, too.
Fanny cries out.   John looks to Robin, pleading for
advice.
                       ROBIN
         The good Friar has done all he
         can. I suggest you let the Arab
         try.
                (as John is
                 undecided)
         If I am wrong, and they die, then
         you may take my life.

John's eyes meet his wife's.   She nods.
                        LITTLE JOHN
         So be it.
                       FRIAR
         Then it will be on your head.
         I have warned you.
He storms out.   All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf.
                       ASLAN
         Bring me a needle, thread, water,
         a skinning knife, and burning
         ashes.
Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases
him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They
whisper.

          What are you going to do?
                        ASLAN
          The child must be taken out by
          the knife.
                          ROBIN
          The knife?
                        ASLAN
          I have seen it many times with
          horses.
                       ROBIN
          Horses? By the Lord, what are
          her chances?
                        ASLAN
          After wasting so much blood...
          not good.
                        ROBIN
          Now you tell me!
Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood.
                        ASLAN
                 (to Fanny)
          Are you ready?... Bite down on
          this... Robin, hold her steady.
He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.

OUTSIDE

Little John paces. Wulf comes out of the hut.      Families
hover and wait. From inside, MUFFLED GROANS.
                        FRIAR
          I tell you, the barbarian is
          killing her.
John moves to the hut.     Wulf restrains him.

INSIDE
The mother heaves, then drops.
                          ROBIN
          Is she gone?

Aslan ignores him, keeps working over Fanny's body.
Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something
in awed Arabic.
                       ROBIN
         What did you say?
Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
                        ASLAN
         It is a boy.
The mother revives.   Aslan places the child on her
breast.

                       ASLAN
         Your son, my lady... Robin, hold
         her skin together while I sew her
         up.
He picks up the needle and thread.   Robin's eyes turn to
the woman's abdomen... He faints.
                                             CUT TO:

LITTLE JOHN
marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn
child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one
side. Bloody and  exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut
door. Tuck jumps  to his feet, drawing his knife.
Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily,
behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares
at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across
his own wrist.
                       FRIAR
         This day God has taught me a fine
         lesson.
He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
                       FRIAR
         I would be honored.
Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp
together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone
cheers.
                       FRIAR
         You are a good man, my barbarian
         friend.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier.    The
courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.
                       SARAH
         What is wrong?
                       COURIER
         My horse seems to be favoring
         a foreleg.
Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A
sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and
SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved,
she calls out.

                          MARIAN
         Who is there?     Duncan!

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!...
A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She
shoos him down.
                       MARIAN
         Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.
She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A
masked SOLDIER.

                       SOLDIER
         We meet again.
He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his
mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods
her with his sword.
                       SOLDIER
         Drop your blade.
                       MARIAN
         You are still overmatched, soldier.
She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table.
Lays his blade against her chest.

                       SOLDIER
         You owe me favors, wench. Bare
         your breasts... or I will do it
         for you.
Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face.
Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her
dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through  his chest.
He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door.
                       DUNCAN
         I am sorry, my lady.    There were
         too many.
She stares at the invaders with studied calm.
                       MARIAN
         Is there something you need,
         gentlemen? I remember no masked
         ball on my calendar.

AERIAL SHOT
FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green,
intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING
AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in...

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT
The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model.
These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord
Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         Forget about Locksley. He is no
         threat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         How can we control all England if
         we cannot control our own county?
         The people are turning him into
         a hero.

                       GREYBEARD BARON
         It is impossible to attack him
         in the forest. We have tried
         everything. He is cunning.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Then we   will be more cunning. I
         must be   rid of him. We may not
         be able   to intercept his next
         warning   to the King.
Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open.
Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the
visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
                       CELTIC CHIEFTAIN
         I want the heads of the men who
         stole my gold.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Welcome, sir. We were discussing
         how to rid ourselves of those very
         men. The outlaws who band with
         Robin Hood.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.
         It is a mistake to ally ourselves
         with foreigners.
                       GREYBEARD BARON
         What can these Celts do that we
         cannot?

The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a
burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log
spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking
at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This rat Hood has hidden out in
         the forest.  He resists all our
         assaults with traps and devices,
         while he robs us blind. We must
         bring him out and destroy him.
The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT
SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - NIGHT
The campfire. Aslan shrieks a war cry.   Dervishes 'round
the fire, swigging from a jug. Equally  drunk, the Friar
follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin  and the others
watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another  jug and hands it
to Aslan.
                       FRIAR
         Come, you son of Saladin. A toast
         to all of Jehovah's children. The
         saved and the damned.
                       ASLAN
         This must be a truly evil potion,
         to make the soul feel this good.
He downs the entire jug in one long draught.   Refills it.
                       ASLAN
         Come, holy man. A toast to all
         of Allah's children. The true
         believers and the fat infidels.
Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the
Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck
looks at Robin.

The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey

his weapon.  The hangover hits him like a mallet. He
clutches his temples.
                       ROBIN
         The dancing demon! Good morning.

         If it was Jehovah who created this

         the punishment into the crime.
An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree.    Robin reacts.

         They need help.


EXT. FOREST LANE - DAY
Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body.
Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The
body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence.
Fighting his emotions.

         A bloke wearin' a mask o' the
         Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.

EXT. CAVES
SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin
rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves
cautiously forward.


POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES
No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
Remnants of a recent ceremony.

BACK TO SCENE
Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
lying face down.

He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white
from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across
Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.

INT. CAVE - DAY
Robin's eyes  -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
Eerie WATERY  sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
He tries to  stand.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Robin!... Robin!

A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating
towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name.
Reaches out his hand.
                       MARIAN
         Death is not to be feared,
         Robin. Embrace it.
Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover-
ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
                        MARIAN
         Drink this.
Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup.   Her hand
grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
                        MARIAN
         Drink.

The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus.
Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
                       MARIAN
         Look at me. Listen to me. You
         belong to me. Your soul is mine.
         You will obey my every word. Do
         you understand?
Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his
subconscious sounding alarms.
                        ROBIN
         Why, Marian?

         I love you.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me.
He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something
changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
Mortianna.
He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,
we see he is surrounded by masked men.
                       ROBIN
                (slurred)
         Where is Marian?
                       MORTIANNA
         She is with friends.
                (cackles)
         Your resistence is strong, but
         useless. Sign this.
                (as quill is forced
                 into his hand)
         You are a Druid like your father.
         You consort with the devil. Your
         confession will be witnessed by
         the Bishop of Hereford.
A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
                       MORTIANNA
                (horror)
         The painted man!
Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A    curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in   the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked    guards
are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,    scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.

                                                     92.
CONTINUED:
Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
                          ASLAN
         Behind you!
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
Robin is slumped against a rock.
                       ROBIN
                (groggy)
         Marian?
Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is
crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
                       BULL
         Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
         burial. Promise me, boy.
                          WULF
         I promise.
Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.

EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
the light from his eyes.
                       ASLAN
         They have poisoned you. There
         are herbs that can alter a man's
         brain. I know of only one cure.
He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       ASLAN
         It worked for me this very
         morning.
                (as Robin heaves)
         You will thank me for this later.

EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY
Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading
another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across
its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up
in front of him.
                       ROBIN
         You have fulfilled your vow.   Now
         you can leave.
                       ASLAN
         Your gratitude warms my heart.
                       ROBIN
         You ignored my request.
                       ASLAN
         It is fortunate that I did.
                       ROBIN
         Because of you, another good man
         is dead.
                       ASLAN
         He urged me to bring him. He was
         a brave man and I grieve for him.
         Praise be to Allah that I do not
         grieve for you also. Or for my
         broken vow.
                       ROBIN
         To hell with your damn vow.
                       ASLAN
         I am glad you are feeling
         better.
Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into
the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the
sky.
                        ROBIN
         The forest!   Ride!

                                                       94.
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
Fire.   Blazing rampant.
Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming
arrows ignites the trees.
Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the
black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.
Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John
vainly attempts to instill calm.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke
          ain't gonna kill ya.
Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
Full retreat.
                        WILL SCARLET
                 (running up)
          It's burning for miles, John.
          It's hotter than hades, and them
          damn screens ain't worth nothing.
Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must
          make a stand.
Most of them keep on running.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Damn y'all! Ya're no more use
          than a load o' wet farts.
                        WILL SCARLET
          Where's that damn Locksley?   I'll
          swear he betrayed us.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody
          bellyachin'.
Hal runs to join them, stuttering.

                 him)
         Gggg... God help us.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight.
Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up
to the Chieftain.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I want prisoners.
The Chieftain does not turn his head.
                       CHIEFTAIN
         We came to fight.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Nevertheless, I need prisoners.
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits.
Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword.
Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
They charge forward.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke
and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the
edge of the clearing.
                       WILL SCARLET
         What are we gonna do, John?

         Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight

         lads?
Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including
Tack.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin'
         wi' the wenches.
                       FRIAR
         This holy man believes in doing
         God's work with his hands.

He snatches a quarterstaff.    John slaps him on the back.
The men are encouraged.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Let's give 'em a bloody good
         wallopin' an' all, lads.

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.
                       ROBIN
         Wulf, stay here. I need your
         horse.
He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

                       ROBIN
         What are you doing?    Out of my
         way!
                       ASLAN
         I saved your life. I will not
         let you give it away for no
         purpose.
                       ROBIN
         Out of my way, damn you!
                       ASLAN
         Does the witch still have
         possession of your senses? If
         we meet up with the survivors we
         may yet give them some help. And
         do some damage to the enemy.

CONTINUED:
Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into
a gallop.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest.
From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
turn and fire again.
They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
being decimated.

Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
                       FRIAR
         Surely you would not harm a man
         of the cloth?
The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
                        FRIAR
         You would?   Then to hellfire with
         you.
He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
fight on.

Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his
attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through
them, slashing with his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver-
ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck
glances heavenwards.
                       FRIAR
         Thank you, Lord.
                (an afterthought)
         And thank you, Allah.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      98.
CONTINUED:
Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs
and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the
edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
His father   spots him.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
         ya li'l bugger.
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...
but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He
freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
simultaneously.
Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass
of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive.
Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree
gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his
wounded shoulder.
Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed
and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Don't 'ee start bleedin'
         blubberin', or ya'll make me
         bloody vomit.

Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over.
All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
                       ASLAN
         It was a fiendish mind that
         planned this campaign.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK
A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a
grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery.
Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags
a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor
and weapons into a growing pile.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         You were an honor to your
         countrymen today, Aslan. You
         fought better than twenty
         English knights.
                       ASLAN
         This war is the God of Abraham
         against the forces of evil.
                       ROBIN
         Well, the war is over.
He stares across the desolate clearing.

                       ROBIN
         There is too much blood on my
         hands.

INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT
A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol-
lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (wry smile)
         Would you prefer pain or death?
                        FIRST WOODSMAN
         Death.

Dignity masking his terror.    Nottingham appears to
consider.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Torture him.
The man is dragged away by guards.    The next PRISONER --
                        NOTTINGHAM
         And you?   Pain or death?
                       SECOND WOODSMAN (PRISONER)

         You will all be tortured. You will
         all tell me all you know about
         Robin Hood, and then you will all
         be hanged. Then we will catch your
         beloved Robin Hood and do the same
         to him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I will kill him for you.
                          WULF
         Will, no!
Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Why would I need you?
                       WILL SCARLET
         All your attempts to kill him
         have failed. Your army failed.
         Your Celtic mercenaries failed.
Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And you can succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I am one of his men. He would
         never suspect me.
                       WULF
         He knows you always hated him,
         traitor.

                       WILL SCARLET
         He is a trusting fool. He will
         believe me. If he doesn't, he
         will kill me and you have lost
         nothing.
Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         If you fail, I will personally
         cut out your lying tongue.
He withdraws the blade.    Will tries to smile.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And if I succeed?

He turns back to Will.   A smile of mock apology.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         It will look better.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A winter's night. Bitterly    cold.  Sad figures huddled
around a small fire. Fanny    tends to John's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their   feet.  John drinks and passes
the jug to Tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. Too
depressed even to drink.
Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
                       ROBIN
         My pride brought us to this.
                       ASLAN
         No, friend. It was you who gave
         these men pride.
                       ROBIN
         I gave them nothing but false
         hope. Tomorrow we will disperse.
         These people can move south and
         start over. You must go home and
         win your Jasmina.

                         ASLAN
         And you?
                       ROBIN
         I am no longer your responsibility.
                       ASLAN
         That is for me to decide.
                       ROBIN
                (raging)
         Damn you, Arab. I want you out of
         my life. Can't you understand
         that? Go home. Go back to your
         own kind.
Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for
argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.

He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging
branch.
                                            CUT TO:

NOVEMBER MOON
Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion,
dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees
before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white
moon against the black sky...
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
-- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
The round medallion has become a noose.
In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
-- Bull. Another -- Marian.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me, Robin.
The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.

Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Why have you betrayed me?   Why?
Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope.
His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ROBIN'S FACE
DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of
a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away
the horror.

CONTINUED:
The first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence,
Robin looks up.
                         ROBIN
         Will!    I thought you were taken.
                         WILL SCARLET
         I was.
                       ROBIN
         How did you escape?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I promised to kill you.
                         ROBIN
         And will you?
Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.     Grabs
Will's throat.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will
         Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a
         bloody favor an' all.
Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with
kids clinging to her skirts.
                       FANNY
         Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im
         if Wulf be still alive.
Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold
just enough for Will to splutter out...
                         WILL SCARLET
         Y... e...
                       LITTLE JOHN

         misery.
                         ROBIN
         John, wait.    Let us hear what he
         has to say.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff,

                       ROBIN
         A traitor sneaks in and out under
         cover of darkness. Will walked in
         and announced himself.
                         LITTLE JOHN
                  (dismissive)
         Aye.    'E always did 'ave balls o'
         brass.
                       HAL
         Let's sss... string 'im up.
                       ROBIN
         Let him speak.

John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his
shoulders.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a
         bloody blade on 'im somewheres.
Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's
shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Bugger me.
He steps back.    Ready to listen.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I bring a message from Nottingham.
         Our men are to be hung in the
         square on Saturday. At high noon.

                       FANNY
         What about my boy?
                         WILL SCARLET
         The boy, too.    Ten men in all.
Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
                         WILL SCARLET
         Their   deaths are a warning.
         Anyone   who associates with the
         outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same
         fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even
         anyone   who so much as utters his
         name.

                       WILL SCARLET
         The hangings are to be part of the
         celebration for the Sheriff's
         marriage.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Marriage, eh? What lucky wench
         gits to play with the Sheriff's
         codpiece?
Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.
                        WILL SCARLET
         Lady Marian.

         Aye, and then with King Richard
         gone, he takes the bloody throne.
Everyone reacts with shock.     Only Robin appears unsur-
prised.
                       ROBIN
         You were to use this news to get
         close to me, and then kill me?
         Right, Will?

                       WILL SCARLET

         Not straightway, of course.

         What is your intention, Will?
                       WILL SCARLET
         That depends on you, Locksley.

         How so?
                       WILL SCARLET

         little rich boy I always took you
         for?
                       ROBIN
         You present quite a choice.    What
         would you have me do, Will?
                       WILL SCARLET
         If you run, I will kill you.
                       ROBIN
         And if I stay, will you all stay
         with me?
Robin checks the other faces.

         To the end, friend.
                       FRIAR

He can't get it out.    Little John covers Hal's mouth.

         'E's in. We're all bloody in.
         Daft buggers.

         There's your answer, Will.    We

EXT. NOTTINGHAM TOWN SQUARE - DUSK
Ten gallows, silhouetted against the setting sun. The
black-armored Celt tests a gallows, springing the hatch.
A heavy sack dangles from the rope. Grim-faced peasants
watch. Among  them -- Fanny Little.

                                                        107.
INT. DUNGEON - DUSK
The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone
walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings
in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He
fingers his wooden crucifix.
                         WULF
           If it be your biddin' that this be

In the troubled human realm, Tuck says his morning
prayer.
                         FRIAR
           Lord, grant us the courage to
           endure, and if you're as smart as
           I believe you are, grant us
           victory... and the victuals to
           celebrate it with.

Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.
                         FRIAR
           Will you pray with me, son of
           Allah?
                         ASLAN
           I have prayed for you, often, my
           brother. But, let us put prayer
           aside and help our gods in a more
           practical manner. I must reveal
           to you the mysteries of the black
           powder.
Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can
react, Robin walks up.

in terror.

         You are truly a wizard.

         there was...
                (chuckles)
         ... I would surely be one.
Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of
bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.
                       ROBIN
         We have no armored knights, no
         glorious banners. But I am
         honored to be going to battle in
         this company. Today we fight not
         just for the lives of our friends,
         but to save all England.
A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand.

         We may be only six men, but...

stick.

         Fanny, show me the exact location
         of the scaffold.

Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The
Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY

... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul
things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.

         How is my bride?
Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his

Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet
she used at the Druid ceremony.

Marian struggles against her bonds.
                       MARIAN
         Get away from me, you disgusting
         hag. I will not... augh!

The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth
open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
watches with amusement.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Mortianna)
         When we are married, thirty of the
         northern barons will pledge me
         their support as king. As you
         predicted.
Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
Clasps the dice-like runes.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see in the portents?
Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
                       MORTIANNA
         The union. The blood of the lion
         and the house of Nottingham. New
         faith. New power. New souls.
She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented.
                       MORTIANNA
         If there is no union, there will
         be darkness, despair, death.
         Ours!

         I have told you what I know.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Confound you, crone. Without my
         protection, the people would hunt
         you down, rip out your black heart
         and burn it.

Mortianna runs at him.   Points her bony finger at his
heart.
                       MORTIANNA
         Without me, you are nothing. You
         are straw, a fleabite, a speck.
                (as Nottingham
                 laughs)
         Laugh, fool. I birthed you from
         this body. I stole a babe in this
         very castle, and killed it so that
         you might rise in its place. You
         are my son.
                (Nottingham is
                 too shocked to
                 react)
         Together we are strong. Now is
         not the time to doubt. Now is the
         time to believe, to be bold. The
         bold will prevail.


EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war-

EXT. DUNGEON GATE - DAY
Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are
too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. A  yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
shoved back by guards.
                      WILL SCARLET
         Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have
         word for you! Of Robin Hood!

         Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I found his lair, but alas he still
         lives.
The Sheriff strikes down with his armored hand.    Will
crumples.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Stretch his neck with the others.
Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak.
Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...
                       WILL SCARLET
         ...He... He... is here!
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Locksley, here? Where ?
Will struggles to get free of his holders.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Call off your dogs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Release him!... Now, where is he?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       113.
CONTINUED:
                       WILL SCARLET
         I want your word, in front of
         these witnesses. If I tell you,
         I will go free.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (scoffs)
         We will find him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         He is concealed. He is going to
         free the prisoners and stop the
         wedding.
Nottingham's jaw tightens.   Eyes the prisoners, the
scaffold.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Put Hood in my hands, you go free.
                       WILL SCARLET
         With the reward. Ten thousand
         crowns.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Damn your worthless hide!    Just
         tell me where he is.
                       WILL SCARLET
         The reward!
The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf
charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab
Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in
the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to
intervene, gets hurled down.

                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Will)
         You'll get your reward. Where
         is he?
                                             CUT TO:

EXT. SCAFFOLD
Tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his
cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.
                       FRIAR
         Out of the way. Make way for
         the Lord's business.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                      114.
CONTINUED:
Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's
direction.

EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
itself. He slips frequently.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded
executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf
staggers, from his beating.
Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart.    He watches them
nervously.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Step down, friar.
                       FRIAR
         As you wish, sire. Is there
         something amiss?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This man claims you have outlaws
         concealed in these barrels. Among
         them the cursed Robin Hood.
Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
                       FRIAR
         This man will rot in hell as a
         knave and a liar. These are
         libations for the celebration
         of your lordship's nuptials.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      115.
CONTINUED:
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Break one open!
                       FRIAR
                (nervous)
         Why waste fine vintage, my lord?
A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Try another. There are many
         barrels, only a few outlaws.
A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- Wulf.
Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
the man's view.
                       SENTRY
         What is your business, woman?
                       FANNY
         Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
         Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
         view up 'ere, ain't it?
She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
He slumps unconscious.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
                       WOUNDED SOLDIER
         Give room for a fightin' man and
         his ma. Step aside, or I'll make
         ya. I wanna see the bastards walk
         on air.

                                                       116.
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses.
                       FANNY
         'Bout time, ya gurt lug.
She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
arrow.
                       FANNY
         We be too late.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
the base.
The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
The Chieftain stands, impassive.
Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close.
An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight.
Little John yells.   Fanny screams.
A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... Robin!
Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the
choking cord.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      117.
CONTINUED:
The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting
it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
by the Celt with the boar's head.
KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion.
Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
rope. He hauls him onto the platform.

Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
                       HAL
         Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
                      WOODSMAN
         Hal! What happened to your
         stutter?
                       HAL
         It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!
A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
                       HAL
         Take that, ya mug.
No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head.
The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         Impostor!   You dishonor the clan.
Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering
blows.

FROM PARAPET
John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch
Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Fight fair...
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                        118.
CONTINUED:
He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a
shaft.
                         LITTLE JOHN
           ...Or don't fight at all.

ON SCENE
Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight
with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.
Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
EXPLODES.
The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the
parapet.
                          GREYBEARD BARON
           Up there!   No mercy, shoot them!
Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      Bolts ricochet
all around Little John and Fanny.

ON SCAFFOLD

Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.

ON SCENE
Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       119.
CONTINUED:
                       WILL SCARLET
         Pain or death, you butcher?
The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him.
Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by
four men.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Here's another message to Robin
         Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.
                       WILL SCARLET
         It's over, fool. You can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
                        REDHEAD BARON
         It's Hood!   Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         I am iron.   I am rock. I am your
         death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
                       ASLAN
         You talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
                       ASLAN
         Englishmen! I am not one of you,
         yet I fight for you. Against a
         tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin
         Hood.
The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      120.

Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants
pursue.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Lower the portcullis! Now!
A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him
aside.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Too slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.
                        ROBIN
         Friends!   We must raise the gate.

EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY
Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while
spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both
sides.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.
         Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.
He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs
his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind
         if I borrow this?
He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to
one.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis.
INT. CASTLE - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders.

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a
mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The
Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Come!   It is time for the union.
The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.    She is
oblivious.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the
practice of black magic. The crucifix on the    altar is
upside down. Marian stands before it, between    the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged    in.
Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.
                       BISHOP
         They are rebelling. We must
         escape.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Marry us. When I am declared king,
         that rabble will not dare go against
         us.
                       BISHOP
         Is is madness to delay.
Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the
Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows.
                       MORTIANNA
         Face them, or face me.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart.
                       ROBIN
         Light all the barrels, Tuck.

Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across
the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels.
FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.
                       ROBIN
         Jump!
Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the
last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the
horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger.
Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.


INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY
Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire.
Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at
Fanny with a knife.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More
peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated
men. Aslan's a whirlwind,  striking out in all
directions. Each blow for  a cause.
                       ASLAN
         For Allah!... For Jehovah!
         For brotherhood!... For
         justice!


INT. CASTLE HALLWAYS - DAY
A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against
three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing a servant)
         Where is she? Where is Lady

The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor,
sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door-
way.
                        ROBIN
         Ah!   There is my answer.
He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage-
ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
                       FRIAR
                (pious)
         My son, there is a holy war being
         waged outside. Release all these
         wretches and God shall surely find
         you a place in heaven.
                       JAILER
         I'd rather go to hell!
WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
Flies back.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
                       BISHOP
         ...your bodies to be bound in
         immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian
         Dubois, take...
The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward.
Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.
                        ROBIN
         Marian, run!   It's me, Robin.
         Run!
Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
prepares to fight him.

         I warned you, I would find you no
         matter what.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         No companions? No army? You rush
         to your death for the sake of a
         woman. Lust has turned you into a
         fool... Recognize this, Locksley?
He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix
sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Appropriate I should use it to
         kill you with, don't you think?
He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying
desperately.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Tuck picks himself up from the floor.    The jailer is
amazed.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord helps those who help
         themselves.
Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his
flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified,
the man catches the smoking bomb.

                       FRIAR
         Give my regards to the devil.
The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.

EXT. PARAPET - DAY
John is in deep trouble, but undaunted.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya gutless bloody sissies.
Someone attacks his assailants from the rear.    The tide
turns.
                      LITTLE JOHN
         Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the
         fightin'.

                       WULF
         Sorry, Father. Couldn't help
         myself.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Well, ya'll get a bloody good
         wallopin' if we get 'ome... For
         now, let's see how well I taught
         ya.
Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY

A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades.
He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their
weapons.
                        HAL
         No!   Fight on. Fight!
He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
                       FRIAR
         Sinners, beware! God's avengers
         are at hand.
Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
                       HAL
         Go' bless ya, Tuck.

Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.
                       FRIAR
         Repent, heathen!
The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
Aslan!

INT. CASTLE - KITCHENS - DAY
The chef raises his knife.    Fanny appeals to the whole
room.
                       FANNY
         Listen! Outside, your countrymen
         rise against the Sheriff.

                       FANNY (CONT'D)
         Is there one man or woman here
         who does not hate him? Who has
         not suffered at his hand?
                (to the chef)
         Turn that on the Sheriff and his
         bullies.
A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
food and cutlery.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY

A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,
knives, hooks, and bedpans.

INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
Nottingham slashes maniacally.   Robin is cornered,
weakening.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You should have stayed away,
         Locksley. Fools like you never
         learn.
A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
followed by Tuck.

                         ASLAN
         Ali akbar!
                         FRIAR
         Amen!
                       MORTIANNA
                (seeing Aslan)
         Agh... the painted one!
Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
floor.
Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                        127.
CONTINUED:
The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path.
                      FRIAR
         So! You sold your soul to the
         devil?
                       BISHOP
         No, I swear it, in God's name.
                       FRIAR
         Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
         men of Druid worship while you
         practice the black arts yourself.
The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.

A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
Aslan.
                       ROBIN
                (glimpsing her)
         Watch out!
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.

                       BISHOP
                (innocently)
         I am sure you would not strike a
         man of the cloth.
                        FRIAR
         Think again!
Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.

EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers
down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     128.
CONTINUED:
                          ASLAN
            What you fear is not below.
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
further through her body in her effort to get at him.
Clutching, screeching, hissing.
Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
the ground.


INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
altar.
                          NOTTINGHAM
            What can your puny God do for
            you now?
The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.
                          ROBIN
            This is for my father.

He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.

EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts
her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes
out. A spitfire.
                           MARIAN
            Let me go!   Who are you?
                                            (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
                (restraining her)
         I'm your sworn protector.   Any
         way I see fit.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
                        MARIAN
         Robin?   Oh God, is that you?
She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you?!
Robin grins at the crowd.
                       ROBIN
         I think she's feeling better.
Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against
Robin's chest.
Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
Fanny.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We done it, mate. We clobbered
         the buggers.
                         FANNY
         Are you 'urt?
                         ROBIN
         It will mend.
He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's
head.
                       ROBIN
         Aslan, my friend.

         I'm going home the easy way,
         Robin.
                       FRIAR
                (shaking Aslan)
         You die on me, you son of satan,
         and I swear I'll bury you as a
         Christian in St. Catherine's
         Cathedral with a thousand monks
         chanting prayers for your
         miserable soul. You hear me?
                       ASLAN
                (weakly)
         I have no strength, Brother Tuck.
                       FRIAR
                (kicking him)
         A fine friend you are! By the
         grace of Allah and Jehovah we
         have won the day, and you want to
         give up the ghost. I'll pickle
         your remains in mead, lay you
         in your grave with a pig for a
         companion, and mark it with a
         cross as big as this castle.
                        ASLAN
         Please!   It hurts when I laugh.
                      FRIAR
         See. There's life in the heathen
         dog yet.
                       ROBIN
                (laughs)
         Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You
         deserve each other.
Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering
grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
                        CROWD
         Robin Hood!   Robin Hood!
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

                       FRIAR (O.S.)
         By the power vested in me by
         God's holy church, I now
         pronounce you husband and wife.
Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
                       FRIAR
         You may kiss the bride.
The husband draws back the bride's veil.    Robin and
Marian. They kiss... long.
                      FRIAR
               (whispers)
         Hurry. We waste good celebration
         time.
They break   the embrace, turn to the congregation and
start down   the aisle. They pause at the front pew,
where KING   RICHARD and members of his court are sitting.
Robin bows,   Marian curtsies.
                       KING RICHARD
         May I kiss the bride?
                       ROBIN
         Who would dare refuse his king's
         request?
                       KING RICHARD
                (kissing Marian's
                 cheek)
         You look radiant, cousin.
                       ROBIN
         We are deeply honored by Your
         Majesty's presence.
                       KING RICHARD
         It is I who am honored, Lord
         Locksley. Thanks to you I still
         have a throne.
They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre-
gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin
embrace.
                       ASLAN
                (whispers)
         My friend, a word of advice...
         Ride her better than your horse.
Robin laughs.
