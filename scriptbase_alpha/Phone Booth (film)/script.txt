                          PHONE BOOTH

                          Larry Cohen


































     FADE IN:

     NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

     MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY

     The sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People
     come and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.

     A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
     workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS
     PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a
     passerby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.

     We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've
     come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.

     MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
     Side and West Side -- uptown and down.

     One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
     takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
     violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
     into a dozen pieces.

                    NARRATOR
          There are 237,911 pay telephones in
          the five burroughs of the city of
          New York.  Many of them are still
          in working order.

     DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --

     NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear
     the words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these
     are human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city
     is wearing them down.

     MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS

     Lips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one
     another.

                    NARRATOR
          Despite increased usage of cellular
          devices, an estimated four and a
          half million New Yorkers and two
          million visitors still utilize pay
          telephones on a regular basis.  At
          thirty-five cents a pop... for the
          first three minutes.

     ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY

     There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
     street.

                    NARRATOR
          You're looking at the telephone
          booth at the corner of 45th Street
          and 8th Avenue in the heart of the
          Manhattan theatrical district.  It
          has been scheduled to be removed
          and replaced by a kiosk.  It's one
          of the few remaining phone booths
          left in the city.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
     well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
     appearance.

                    WOMAN IN BOOTH
               (into receiver)
          You have lied to me for the last
          time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I
          don't ever want to hear the sound
          of your fucking voice again.
               (listens)
          Yes, well fuck you, too!

     She slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains
     vacant for a brief interval.

                    NARRATOR
          At least three hundred calls daily
          originate from this booth.  The
          coins are collected twice a day. 
          This booth has been burglarized
          forty-one times in the last six
          months.

     Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for
     coins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair
     styled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly
     takes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen
     suit and silk Armani tie.

     He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a
     middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby
     restaurant and has finally caught up with him.

                    MARIO
          Stu, we got to talk.

                    STU
          Wish I could accommodate you,
          Mario, but this is my busy time of
          day.

                    MARIO
          How come you cross the street every
          time you go past the restaurant?

                    STU
          Why don't I stop in later for some
          lunch?

                    MARIO
          There's no more drinks or free
          meals until the restaurant starts
          showing up in the columns like you
          said.

                    STU
          I'm doing my level best for you
          people.

                    MARIO
          One lousy mention in the Post and
          you expect to eat for six months!

                    STU
          I got the food critic from the
          Village Voice all lined up to give
          you a review.

                    MARIO
          That's what you tell me last July. 
          And he never shows.

                    STU
          I was allowing you time to expand
          the menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms,
          for God sakes.  You get only one
          shot with these fucking critics and
          I don't want you to blow a rare
          opportunity.

                    MARIO
          You the one blowing it.  How long
          you think you can fuck everybody?

                    STU
          Hold on right there.  I've got a
          very excellent reputation around
          this town.

                    MARIO
          So how come you take two nice suits
          of clothes from Harry and never get
          his daughter on David Letterman?

                    STU
          Hell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a
          publicist.

                    MARIO
          Mister, you're nothing!

                    STU
          Believe me, Valerie's on the
          waiting list to audition.  Harry's
          got no complaints.  He just let me
          pick out this tie the other day.

                    MARIO
          That Harry's a damn fool!

                    STU
          Mario, please let me make this up
          to you.  How about I arrange for
          the opening night party for this
          new off-Broadway show I'm handling 
          -- to be held at your place with
          local TV coverage on nine and
          eleven?  I mean I had it promised
          to another client -- who actually
          pays me money.  But it isn't firmed
          up yet.  And I could throw it your
          way.  Maybe.

                    MARIO
          What is involved?

                    STU
          You'd toss in the buffet for say
          seventy or eighty.  The producers
          would supply their own vino, of
          course.  I'd deliver you a
          truckload of celebrities.  And if
          they like the food, they'll all
          come back, naturally.

                    MARIO
          What celebrities?

                    STU
          You want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar
          winner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?

                    MARIO
          Is he still alive?

                    STU
          I saw him last night going into the
          Four Seasons.  I'll bring you over
          a whole VIP list when we come by
          for dinner.

                    MARIO
          How come everybody wants to eat but
          nobody wants to pay?

                    STU
          You can't think small like that. 
          Hey, you still feature musicians
          Fridays and Saturdays?

                    MARIO
          At least they work for their meals.

                    STU
          What about Harry's daughter as an
          extra added attraction?  She'll
          belt out five or six showtunes --
          two sets a night -- and it won't
          cost you a fucking nickel.

                    MARIO
          How come?

                    STU
          Star Showcase!  Let me handle
          setting that up.  And when she
          eventually goes on Letterman,
          she'll announce I'm currently
          appearing over at Mario's fine
          supper club.  Right over CBS she'll
          say that, Mario.

                    MARIO
          You're full of shit.  You know
          that?  All bullshit!

                    STU
          That's just a vulgar word for PR.
               (placing an arm around
               him)
          Mario, you can't hurt my feelings. 
          Even when I was a kid and they
          hurled certain invectives my way,
          it never bothered me.  Other kids
          would fall apart if anybody called
          them a fucking name.  Me, I just
          loved the attention!  'Shit-for-
          brains' -- that's what the bigger
          kids named me.  And I answered to
          it.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'
          reporting for duty.  Everybody
          loved me for that.  I could take
          abuse.  After a while, I kind of
          wore them down.  There was nothing
          more they could say to me.  So they
          stopped.  I kind of missed it.

                    MARIO
          I'm sorry I even talked to you.

                    STU
          I'll bet your loving wife put you
          up to this.  She saw me pass by and
          she sent you out in the street. 
          But I don't hold it against you
          personally -- you still serve up
          superior veal chop.
               (entering phone booth)
          Now I got urgent business to
          conduct, Mario.

     He slides the booth closed in Mario's face.

     The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
     before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
     goes up the block.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
     dials.

                    STU
          Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Where have you been?  Do you think
          I have nothing to do but wait
          around for you to call?

                    STU
          I'm only a few minutes late,
          loveliest individual on earth.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see
          you?

                    STU
          Good news in that arena.  Kelly
          goes into rehearsal as of Monday. 
          You know how dedicated she is.  By
          the time she gets back from dancing
          her ass off, she goes right to
          sleep.  We'll have both our days
          and certain nights.  Not to mention
          when they take the show on the
          road.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          How long is that for?

                    STU
          Four to five weeks -- minimum.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Maybe I should quit my job so we
          can be together full time.

                    STU
          I wouldn't do that.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Sometimes I think if I have to give
          one more fucking manicure...

                    STU
          That's how you met me.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          I never saw a worse set of nails. 
          Bit right down to the quick.

                    STU
          I'm much better groomed since
          you've been looking after me.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          I'm glad you admit it.

                    STU
          Even Kelly remarked on it when I
          first met her.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          She could care less how you look. 
          She's only interested in pushing
          her own career.  Some wife you're
          stuck with!

                    STU
          The marriage is not without its
          compensations.  Do you imagine I
          could afford that apartment on what
          I'm earning?  Not with everybody
          cutting back on the publicity.  Not
          to mention a million college
          graduates coming into the
          profession trying to cut me out. 
          And one thing you can't expect from
          your clients is loyalty.  They get
          a couple of bad notices, they dump
          you.  Goodbye.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Don't go.

                    STU
          I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I
          was saying how the clients try to
          give you the wave off without even
          a month's notice.

     A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
     waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a
     few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu
     who slides the booth open a crack.

                    STU
               (yelling)
          What?  Is your watch busted?  It's
          twenty after eleven and I'm gonna
          be occupied indefinitely with my
          transaction.  So get out of my
          face!

     He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the
     gentleman who gives up and departs.

                    STU
          Sorry, honey.  There will be no
          further interruption.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Why must you always be calling me
          from some booth?

                    STU
          On account of that phone records
          are regularly subpoenaed in divorce
          proceedings.  And I don't want some
          entry showing up on my cellular
          bill either.  She gets the mail. 
          She looks these items over. 
          Sometimes she even dials up a
          strange number to see who it is.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Then she suspects something.

                    STU
          It's only because her last husband,
          the choreographer, ran around on
          her.  She can't get that out of her
          head.  That's how she caught onto
          him.  The phone bills.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          She hasn't developed much skill at
          holding a man.

                    STU
          You know what a self-fulfilling
          prophecy is?  She was so sure I was
          going to find me a woman that she
          finally drove me back to you.  I
          thought I'd feel all guilty about
          it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked
          in yet.
               (beat)
          Still, I wouldn't do anything to
          hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a
          decent individual.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          What about hurting me?  Like last
          time?

                    STU
          Hurt?  You were glad to be rid of
          me.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          For a while I was, 'til I took
          stock of what was around.  You're
          the lesser of many evils.

                    STU
          That's about the nicest thing you
          ever said.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          I'll have it engraved.

                    STU
          We've been up front with each other
          from the beginning.  Let's keep it
          that way.  How about a drink?  Say
          seven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Meet me in front.  I don't like
          walking in there unescorted.

                    STU
          Yeah, you're great enough looking
          to be mistaken for one of those
          thousand dollar a night girls.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          It happens all the time lately.

                    STU
          And wear that short black number I
          bought you from Bendel's.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Again?  I don't know if it's me or
          that dress you like.

                    STU
          Have a good day.  Make plenty of
          tips.  And leave the whole evening
          open.  She thinks I've got Knicks
          tickets.

     He hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his
     jacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on
     the first ring.

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          Speak!

                    STU
               (into cellular)
          It's your boy Stuart.  When was the
          last time I called you for a favor?

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          The column is already full.

                    STU
          I just need one line.  Anybody you
          wanna say was seen dining out at
          Mario's Stromboli restaurant.

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          Maybe you don't hear so good?  I
          got no space for you.

                    STU
          Who's asking any favors?  I'm
          offering reciprocal information.

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          Since when were you ever a reliable
          source?

                    STU
          Check it out.  Tony award-winning
          producer Willie Beagle tossed his
          wife back into rehab again
          following her third attempt at
          diving off the terrace at their
          plush eighteen room residence at
          the San Remo.  I got it from the
          doorman.

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          I got it from their maid yesterday. 
          It's in the paper today.  Or don't
          you bother to read my shit?

                    STU
          Louis, my intentions were entirely
          honorable.

                    COLUMNIST (V.O.)
          I'll drop your item in sometime
          next week.  If you promise not to
          call me for a month.

     He hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone
     and tucks it away.

     Then he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And
     rings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice
     on the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.

                    VOICE
          Don't even think about leaving that
          booth.

                    STU
          What?

                    VOICE
          Stay exactly where you are and
          listen carefully.

                    STU
          I've got a heavy day, mister.

                    VOICE
          You know better than to disobey me.

                    STU
          I don't know you at all.

                    VOICE
          Are you absolutely sure?

                    STU
          Who is this?

                    VOICE
          Someone who's watching you.

                    STU
          Get lost!

                    VOICE
          Love the gray suit.  That red and
          black tie makes a nice combination.

     Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. 
     He looks around nervously.

                    STU
          Where?  Where are you?

                    VOICE
          Closer than you think.

                    STU
          I don't see you.

                    VOICE
          There are any number of windows. 
          Check them out.

     Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise
     buildings and hotels.

                    STU
          Okay, you had your little joke.

                    VOICE
          I'm not sufficiently amused.  Not
          yet.  We have more to talk about.

     Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him
     not to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice.

                    STU
          Do me a favor.  Call up somebody
          else.

                    VOICE
          But it's you I'm interested in. 
          You know how many people use that
          booth every day?

                    STU
          Why don't you tell me?

                    VOICE
          Better than two-hundred people on
          average.

                    STU
          Is that what you do?  Count them?

                    VOICE
          What else do I have to do?  It's
          interesting watching people. 
          Trying to guess who they are.  And
          what they're up to.

                    STU
          What are you -- a shut-in of some
          kind?

                    VOICE
          You might say that.  I can't go
          out.  I might be seen.

                    STU
          Somebody's looking for you?

                    VOICE
          Desperately.

                    STU
          The cops?

                    VOICE
          Not yet.

                    STU
          The ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run
          out on child support?

                    VOICE
          What kind of man do you think I am?

                    STU
          Frankly, I could care less.  You
          had your fun.  Now goodbye.

                    VOICE
          It's not in your best interests to
          hang up on me.  That would make me
          angry.

                    STU
          Isn't that just too bad?

                    VOICE
          For you.

                    STU
          There's ten million names in the
          phonebook.  Pester somebody else.

                    VOICE
          I never talk to people I can't see. 
          I need to study their reactions.

                    STU
          Alright, bullshit artist, what am
          I doing right now?

                    VOICE
          Scratching your forehead with your
          left hand.  Now you're brushing
          your hair back.

                    STU
          Okay, okay, you got me in your
          scrutiny.  So what?

                    VOICE
          So let's talk.

                    STU
          Only I got nothing to say.

                    VOICE
          Oh, you will.  You'll do a lot of
          talking before this conversation is
          over.  And it'll only end when I
          want it to.

                    STU
          Is that a fact?  Well if you watch
          closely, you will see me hang up.

                    VOICE
          I don't think you will.

                    STU
          Why not?

                    VOICE
          I interest you.

                    STU
          Why should I be interested in some
          creep who gets his jollies spying
          on strangers in phone booths?

                    VOICE
          But you're not a stranger, Stu.

     The sound of his own name sends a chill through him.

                    STU
          Who put you up to this?

                    VOICE
          You were my very own selection.

                    STU
          Why me in particular?

                    VOICE
          Because you're so afraid.

                    STU
          Ha!  What've I got to be afraid of?

                    STU
          Just about everything.  You have so
          much to hide.

                    STU
          How do you figure that?

                    VOICE
          Why else would a man with a
          perfectly good cellular bother to
          make calls from a pay booth?

                    STU
          That's my business.

                    VOICE
          I've made it mine.

                    STU
          All of a sudden I'm required to
          give explanations to you?

                    VOICE
          In explicit detail.

                    STU
          What is this?  Some kind of candid
          camera gag?  Or like that thing on
          HBO where the cab driver is taping
          what goes on in the back seat?

                    VOICE
          This is not showbusiness, my
          friend.  This is reality.

                    STU
          Your reality.  Not mine, you
          lowlife fuck.

                    VOICE
          Stu, you'll be made to suffer for
          your attitude, so let's dispense
          with the vulgarities.

                    STU
          Now you're threatening me!  Fuck
          you.  Could that be any clearer?

                    VOICE
          You're only making it easier for me
          to do you harm.

                    STU
          Oh yeah.  Right.  Can you see how
          I'm trembling?

                    VOICE
          You will be.

                    STU
          Shit, this is a new one.  Fucking
          threatening calls in a goddam phone
          booth.  When are you going to start
          with the heavy breathing.

                    VOICE
          I'm not the degenerate.  You are,
          Stu.

                    STU
          You don't know anything about me.

                    VOICE
          Infinitely more than you know about
          me.

                    STU
          Like what?

                    VOICE
          Like the number you dialed when you
          first entered the booth.

                    STU
          How would you know that?

                    VOICE
          I'm watching through a scope and I
          could clearly read the buttons you
          pushed.  I have another extension
          here by the window.  Shall I dial
          that same number back for you? 
          Would that convince you?

     Stu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall
     buildings that surround the street corner.

     STU'S POV

     PANNING up at thousands of windows.  The Voice could be
     coming from anywhere.

     BACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH

                    VOICE
          Let's see who's on the other end of
          the line.

                    STU
          Don't.

                    VOICE
          Too late.
               (beat)
          It's already ringing.  I'll hold
          the receiver up so you can listen
          in.

     Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings.

     Then Mavis' voice can be heard answering.  Stu listens
     helplessly.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Hello?

                    VOICE
          Well, hello.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Who is this?

                    VOICE
          Someone who's really tight with
          your boyfriend -- who just called
          you from his favorite phone booth.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          You know Stu?

                    VOICE
          Stu?  Oh, I know him better than
          anyone.  What he does -- how he
          thinks.  How he lies.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Who the hell is this?

                    VOICE
          Stu is listening in.  He knows what
          we're both saying.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Stu?  Is that true?  Are you there?

                    VOICE
          He doesn't feel like talking.

                    STU
               (shouts)
          Mavis!  Just hang up the goddam
          phone.

                    VOICE
          She can't hear you, Stu.  Only me.
               (a pause)
          Mavis, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been
          totally honest with you.  But then
          he can't be honest with anyone, can
          he?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          What's your name?  To whom am I
          speaking?

                    VOICE
          You've never heard of me, Mavis. 
          He doesn't want you to know I
          exist.  He wishes I didn't exist. 
          But there isn't anything he can do
          about that.
               (beat)
          Still there, Stu?  All you can do
          is listen.

                    STU
          Mavis -- the guy is a fucking
          nutcase!  Hang the fuck up.

                    VOICE
          She doesn't want to.  She wants to
          know all about us.  Don't you,
          Mavis?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Did his wife put you up to this? 
          That bitch, Kelly?

                    VOICE
          Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly.  My
          very next call.

                    STU
               (yells)
          He doesn't know my wife!  Don't
          tell him anything else.

     Outside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too
     tight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the
     phone.  Her name is FELICIA.  She taps on the glass.

                    FELICIA
          Could you hurry it along?

     Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass
     with hostility.

     Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else.  He's too
     distracted by the madness happening over the telephone.

                    STU
          Can you hear me, Mavis?  Keep your
          big mouth shut.

                    VOICE
          Is that any way to talk to a woman
          you love?
               (beat)
          Mavis, is he always that abusive to
          you?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          You're getting me all upset.  I
          don't know who you are or how you
          know all this --

                    VOICE
          I find out things -- from watching
          people and listening to them.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Just what is your relationship to
          Stu?  That's all I want to know.

                    VOICE
          Well, what do you think?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          Answer me, goddam it!

                    VOICE
          Well alright.  Stu and I are --
          longtime companions.  A pair.  Two
          of a kind.  Closer than close. 
          Peas in a pod.  Spoons in a drawer.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          You pervert!

                    VOICE
          That, too.

                    STU
          Don't believe a word of it.  It's
          all lies.

                    VOICE
          Too late, Stu.  She already
          believes it.

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          You can tell that scumbag never to
          bother me again.

                    VOICE
          He won't care.  He'll still have
          me.

                    STU
          It's not true.  I do care.

     From outside the booth, there's a louder rapping on the
     glass.  Felicia really wants in.

                    FELICIA
          Get done in there, mister.  I got
          me an important call.

                    STU
          Go away.

                    FELICIA
          Shit I will!  Finish up!

     She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on
     the two-way phone call.

                    VOICE
          Why don't you tell me what you
          think of us?

                    MAVIS' VOICE
          You're both disgusting.

                    VOICE
          That's what he said about you. 
          Well, if Stu didn't have the balls
          to come out and tell you the truth,
          I felt it was my responsibility to
          clear the air.  Goodbye now, Mavis. 
          Thanks for your time.
               (the phone clicks off; we
               hear only a dial tone)
          Back to you again, Stu.

                    STU
          You total asshole!  How could you
          do that?

                    VOICE
          Speaking of females, that woman
          hovering outside the booth -- may
          as well tell her that you'll be on
          the line forever.

                    STU
          Like hell I will.

                    VOICE
          I'm ready for you to take out your
          cellular and phone home.  And this
          time, I'll listen in.

                    STU
          There's no chance of that.

                    VOICE
          Or should I call Kelly and make up
          something totally outrageous?  You
          must realize by now I have a vivid
          imagination.

                    STU
          You don't know our phone number!

                    VOICE
          Are you absolutely sure?  I may
          have been watching you on a regular
          basis.  Keeping track of all the
          numbers I see you dial.

                    STU
          And I'm supposed to believe that?

                    VOICE
          I've put a great deal of
          preparation into this -- prior to
          actually saying hello.  Now do you
          want to dial 832-7165 -- or should
          I?

     The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even
     more than the earlier mention of his name.

                    STU
          What are you going to tell her?

                    VOICE
          You'll do the talking.

                    STU
          What am I supposed to say?

                    VOICE
          Try telling her the truth.

                    STU
          Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly. 
          She's always there for me.  It's
          just my nature to have a little
          'strange' on the side.  It doesn't
          mean shit.

                    VOICE
          But you still find it necessary?

                    STU
          Kind of like having a beautiful
          home.  With everything you ever
          dreamed of.  But you still need
          that vacation now and then.  Some
          nice hotel room with a great view. 
          Maybe a pool.  Only you wouldn't
          want to spend more than a few days
          in any hotel.  Eventually, you want
          to go back to your home and all
          your stuff.  You're real glad to
          check out.

                    VOICE
          Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? 
          I'm sure they'll both appreciate
          that explanation.

                    STU
          You're ruining my fucking life, you
          sonofabitch.

                    VOICE
          Didn't I warn you about calling me
          names?  It makes me vindictive.

                    STU
          What else can you do to me?

                    VOICE
          We haven't even begun.

                    STU
          She's not home.  She went out.

                    VOICE
          I'll bet she's back.  Now hold the
          cellular up where I can see it --
          so I can be certain you don't
          misdial on me.
               (pause)
          A little higher and to your left. 
          Now I have it in perfect view. 
          Dial slowly.

     More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black
     lady outside.

                    FELICIA
          If you got you a cell phone, how
          come you taking up the whole
          fucking booth!  This here's an
          emergency!

                    STU
          There's another booth on the next
          block.

                    FELICIA
          It's busted.  Every damn phone on
          Eighth Avenue is busted but this
          one.

                    STU
          Well, I'm not through!  Go in a
          restaurant or someplace, but get
          away from me!

                    FELICIA
          I'm gonna pull you out of that
          booth and snatch you ballheaded!

     She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu
     jams it shut, right on her hand.

                    FELICIA
          You assaulted my person.

                    STU
          Let me hear from your lawyer!

                    FELICIA
          You're hear alright.  I'm coming
          back.  And your ass better not be
          around.

     She stalks off obviously in search of assistance.

                    VOICE
          Good work, Stu.  Now let me see you
          dial.  Tuck the receiver under your
          chin and dial your remote.

                    STU
          I'm doing it.

     He punches in the digits.  The phone rings -- and rings.

                    STU
          I told you she was out.

                    VOICE
          Let it ring.

     Then a girl's voice is heard.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Shepard residence.

                    VOICE
          Hold it close to the receiver so I
          can hear.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Hello?

                    STU
          Honey, it's me.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          What's taking you so long?  I
          thought we were having some lunch
          at Mario's?

                    STU
          Change of plan.  We're not eating
          in that dump any more.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          How come?

                    STU
          The Health Department gave them a
          'C' rating -- that's how come. 
          Here I'm trying to put the place on
          the map and he fucks it all up with
          a major roach problem.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          That's disgusting.  Okay, I'll fix
          us a sandwich.  Where are you now?

                    STU
          Just in a phone booth.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          How come?  The caller ID says
          you're on your cellular.

                    STU
          Oh yeah, I am.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          But you're also in some phone
          booth?

                    VOICE
          Explain that one, Stu.

                    STU
          I only stepped in because the
          traffic was so loud outside.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Well just hurry on back.

                    VOICE
          Tell her you can't.

                    STU
          Not for a few minutes.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Are you sure you're alone?  I hear
          somebody in the background.

                    STU
          The guy in the next booth.  He's
          got a bad connection and he's
          hollering his fool head off.

                    VOICE
          You've got an answer for
          everything.

                    STU
          I love you, baby.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Do you?

                    STU
          You know that.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Stu -- who was that man?

                    STU
          What man?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Some person who phoned fifteen
          minutes ago -- just after you went
          out.

                    STU
          I don't understand...

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          This total stranger rang up and
          told me to wait by the phone --
          because you'd be calling me in a
          few minutes -- from a booth.  And I
          said what would he be doing in any
          phone booth?

                    STU
          And what did this guy say?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          He said you'd be making phone
          calls.  What else?

                    STU
          Making calls is part of my
          business.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          To whom?

                    STU
          Clients.  People.  Planting items
          like I do.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Women?

                    STU
          Once in a while one of them could
          be a woman.  I just called
          "Elaine's" and talked to her to see
          who was in there last night.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          You know exactly what I mean.

                    STU
          You're not going to start that shit
          again?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          I just feel something is wrong.

                    STU
          What could be wrong?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          The way you sound.  You don't sound
          like yourself.

                    STU
          Yeah?  Who do I sound like?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          Someone who's scared.  There's fear
          in your voice like I've never heard
          before.

                    VOICE
          See, Stu?  Kelly agrees with me.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          I want you to come back home.  Now!

                    STU
          I told you.  In a while.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          No.  I want you here now.  In case
          he calls back, I don't want to
          answer again.

                    STU
          Why should he call back?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          I feel like he's going to.

                    STU
          You're the one that sounds
          frightened.  And of nobody.

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          He's not a nobody.  He knows about
          us.

                    STU
          You're not telling me all he said. 
          What are you holding back?

                    KELLY'S VOICE
          I can't discuss it on the phone. 
          Just get over here!

     CLICK!  She hangs up.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          Why did you do that to her?  She
          never did you any harm.

                    VOICE
          How would you know?  Everybody does
          harm to somebody.  And then they
          try their best to forget it.

                    STU
          Maybe me -- but not her.  Whatever
          I've done, there's no reason to
          take it out on her.

                    VOICE
          Suppose that's the only way I can
          get to you?  You claim you love
          her.

                    STU
          Yeah, I do.

                    VOICE
          You don't even love yourself.

                    STU
          But Kelly... I would never hurt.

                    VOICE
          Still you have to uphold your
          status as an honorary asshole.

                    STU
          Listen, I've treated all my women
          decent.  I never laid a hand on any
          of them, even when provoked.  And I
          always let them down easy.
               (beat)
          I'm not ready to let Kelly go. 
          Maybe I never will be.

                    VOICE
          What if she dumps you first? 
          What's the odds she's already taken
          up with somebody?  One day soon
          you'll come home and find her gone
          along with the CD player and the
          VCR.

                    STU
          I'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me
          all day!  That's it.  This call is
          ended.

                    VOICE
          Not until I say it is.

                    STU
          What happens if I hang up?

                    VOICE
          You don't really want to find out.

                    STU
          I'm dying to hear this!!!  What the
          fuck can you do about it -- up in
          your fucking high window with your
          goddam binoculars?

                    VOICE
          I never indicated I had binoculars. 
          I said I had a highly magnified
          telescopic image of you that
          brought you up so close I could see
          where you nicked yourself under the
          chin shaving this morning.

                    STU
          Oh -- while you're at it, have a
          look up my ass.

                    VOICE
          I may very well do that, Stu.  In
          the meantime, think about what kind
          of device has a telescopic sight
          mounted on it.

                    STU
          What?  You mean... like a rifle?

                    VOICE
          A high-powered .30 calibre bolt
          action Remington 700 with a carbon
          one modification and a state of the
          art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. 
          And you're in the cross hairs, Stu.

                    STU
          I'm supposed to believe that?

                    VOICE
          There's only one way I can prove it
          to you.  Hang up the receiver and
          find out.  At this range, the exit
          wound ought to be about the size of
          a small tangerine.

                    STU
          And you're just going to kill me
          for no reason?

                    VOICE
          For plenty of reasons!  Because you
          hung up.  For years I hated people
          hanging up on me.  Ex-girlfriends. 
          Women I didn't even know. 
          Prospective employers.

                    STU
          I get hung up on all the time.  You
          get used to it.

                    VOICE
          Or else you don't.  I worked for
          months getting people to switch to
          MCI -- being insulted at and being
          hung up on hundreds of times a day. 
          The ones that cursed me out for
          invading their privacy never
          bothered me as much as those that
          clicked off without even bothering
          to reply.

                    STU
          Then why didn't you go after one of
          them?

                    VOICE
          Maybe you are one of them.

                    STU
          Hey, I have worked in a boiler room
          myself peddling "Term Life."  I
          Would never be rude to a fellow
          salesperson.

                    VOICE
          Can you feel it on you now?  The
          heat of it.  I'm moving the strike
          zone down to your stomach area. 
          Now I'm raising it up again. 
          Directly above the chest cavity --
          sliding up to the forehead just
          above the left ear.

                    STU
          Shit -- I do feel it.

                    VOICE
          Tell me where I'm going with it
          now.

                    STU
          Across my forehead -- now back
          where it was before.

                    VOICE
          I'm amazed how you can do that. 
          You're amazingly accurate.
               (beat)
          Now I know what you're thinking. 
          If I drop down on the floor of the
          booth and flatten myself out...

                    STU
          No, I'm not thinking that.

                    VOICE
          Oh yes you are.  Can I crawl out
          using the booth as a shield?  Can I
          crawl to that Chrysler illegally
          parked only three or four feet
          away?  The shattering glass may cut
          me, but it'll only be superficial. 
          Otherwise, this lunatic will never
          let me out alive.

                    STU
          No.  You will.  I know you will. 
          If I just cooperate.

                    VOICE
          Where is it now?  Think and feel
          for the warm spot.

                    STU
          Below the shoulder?

                    VOICE
          Which one?

                    STU
          The right shoulder.

                    VOICE
          Remarkable how we're in tune. 
          You're doing far better than the
          others.

                    STU
          What others?  What do you mean?
               (no reply)
          You said 'others!'

                    VOICE
               (finally)
          I'm sure you read about the Italian
          tourist shot dead ten days ago at
          the corner of Forty-fifth and
          Eighth?

                    STU
          I saw it on the news.

                    VOICE
          And where are we now?

                    STU
          Oh, God.  Forty-fifth and Eighth.

                    VOICE
          What else do you remember about
          that killing?

                    STU
          I don't know.

                    VOICE
          Try.

                    STU
          He was gunned down.  And nobody was
          caught.  And they didn't even
          bother to take his wallet or his
          watch... or anything.

                    VOICE
          Now you know why.  It wasn't a
          robbery.

                    STU
          What did he do?

                    VOICE
          He hung up -- so I disconnected him
          permanently.

                    STU
          Please -- don't do it to me.  You
          got no reason to do it to me.

                    VOICE
          Don't give me reason.

                    STU
          I'm not looking to.  Tell me what
          you want!

                    VOICE
          Tell me about your job.

                    STU
          What's to tell?  I'm in Public
          Relations.  They used to call us
          "flacks."  Now we're media
          consultants.

                    VOICE
          What do you do, exactly?

                    STU
          Plant items in the paper and on the
          tube.  More important sometimes,
          keep stuff out.

                    VOICE
          What've you kept out?

                    STU
          One of my people got nailed for
          indecent exposure.  I managed for
          the cops to use his real name
          instead of his stage name so nobody
          picked up on it.

                    VOICE
          You saved the little deviate's ass,
          didn't you?

                    STU
          He's in major therapy now.  I swear
          he is.

                    VOICE
          You must hang with some major
          celebrities.  Journalists,
          newscasters -- those types.

                    STU
          I'm real close with Larry King. 
          And the "Hard Copy" people.

                    VOICE
          Could you get him down here?  Larry
          King?

                    STU
          Why would he want to come here?

                    VOICE
          Because you asked him to.

                    STU
          He comes from Atlanta.

                    VOICE
          Well, who could you get?

                    STU
          I don't know.

                    VOICE
          Wolf Blitzer?

                    VOICE
          Probably not.

                    VOICE
          Regis?

                    STU
          Definitely no chance.

                    VOICE
          You'd be offering them an exclusive
          newsbreak.  I'm talking about more
          than one homicide.

                    STU
          How many?

                    VOICE
          I don't answer questions.  I ask
          them.

                    STU
          I gotta have the facts.  They might
          not believe me.  My record isn't
          too good when it comes to hard
          news.

                    VOICE
          You're not considered a reliable
          source?

                    STU
          On a divorce or separation, maybe. 
          Or who's gay, or who isn't gay any
          more.  I kind of specialize in that
          kind of material.  I mean I could
          probably get you Joe Franklin.

                    VOICE
          How about Cindy Adams?

                    STU
          I might have a shot.  Are you
          familiar with Liz Smith?

                    VOICE
          Do you know her number?

                    STU
          Want I should call her?  How much
          can I say?

                    VOICE
          Tell her you're in direct touch
          with a killer who's willing to
          speak honestly if she shows up here
          alone and without notifying the
          authorities.

                    STU
          She usually likes to have a
          celebrity involved.  If you had an
          actor or a sports figure held
          prisoner instead of me, there'd be
          better odds she's come.

                    VOICE
          Then lie.  Pick a celebrity and put
          them in the booth.

                    STU
          Let's see.  Who does she like?  Who
          couldn't be reached to deny it?

                    VOICE
          I'm anxious to see you in action. 
          Don't keep me waiting.

     Stu uses his cellular again.

                    STU
               (dialing)
          Sometimes you only get her service.
               (into cellular)
          Hi -- Stu Shepard.  Put me through. 
          I've got hard news for her.  I can
          only talk to her directly.  But say
          it regards -- Liza.

                    VOICE
          Liza?  That was imaginative.

                    STU
               (into cellular)
          No, I can't call back.  I'll have
          to lay in on somebody else. 
          Alright, but I can't hang on long.
               (to pay phone)
          She's coming on.
               (to cellular)
          Liz, hello.  Sure I'll make it
          brief.  Killing two weeks ago in
          the theatre district?  Turn out a
          sniper did the job.  Yeah, a sniper
          with a rifle.  Now he's got another
          victim lined up.  Not just your
          anonymous New Yorker, but Liza. 
          Now you can't call anybody or Ms. 
          Minelli's dead meat and so am I. 
          She's hostage in a phone booth
          right in the sniper's sights.  But
          he says he'll talk to you and let
          her walk.  I know it'll take balls
          to do this, but you're a fine and
          courageous newspaper woman...

     There's a click.  Silence.

                    STU
          Hello?  Hello?
               (to pay phone)
          Either she's on her way over or she
          doesn't believe me.

                    VOICE
          You weren't particularly
          convincing.

                    STU
          I didn't really believe in what I
          was saying.

                    VOICE
          Because you don't really believe my
          Remington is pointed at you?

                    STU
          I do.

                    VOICE
          You're ninety percent sure.

                    STU
          At least ninety-five percent, easy.

                    VOICE
          Let me erase all doubt.

                    STU
          No.  Don't shoot.

                    VOICE
          Control yourself, Stu.  Glance down
          at your chest.  What do you see.

                    STU
          Oh, my God.  A dot.  A fucking red
          dot.

     A tiny red dot now moves across Stu's chest.

                    VOICE
          Like you've seen in the movies?

                    STU
          The laser dot.  Just before some
          poor bastard always gets blown
          away.

                    VOICE
          Usually a supporting player.  That
          lovely but by now generic special
          effect of the bullet piercing the
          forehead.

     The tiny red laser dot dances around Stu's chest and stomach 
     -- the jumps up and remains between his eyes.

                    VOICE
          This takes all the guesswork out of
          it.  You know exactly where to
          expect it before I even tighten my
          finger on the trigger.

                    STU
          Don't tighten.  Don't even tickle
          that fucking finger.

                    VOICE
          How about Geraldo?  He's run his
          ass off to get in on this.

                    STU
          You're talking about the old
          Geraldo.  Look, I can try and reach
          cable NBC.  They're hungry.

                    VOICE
          I'm disappointed.  I wanted to go
          first class.

                    STU
          They do a great job.  They'll haul
          a whole crew over to cover your
          surrender "live."

                    VOICE
          I never expressed interest in
          giving myself up.  There are so
          many other phone booths in the
          city.  I'm just getting warmed up.

                    STU
          That's entirely up to you.  Your
          choice.  I'm just trying to set you
          up with the proper communicator.
               (beat)
          I suppose Liza wasn't strong
          enough.  I should've said Madonna.

                    VOICE
          Now you're being creative.

     Outside the booth, the angry black woman has returned,
     bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks
     like he means business.  He slams his fist against the glass,
     nearly shattering it.

                    LEON
          Drag your baggy butt out of that
          booth.  We got business to conduct
          out of there.

                    FELICIA
          He been in there all day.

                    STU
          I'm not through.

                    LEON
          Hang up that receiver or I'll make
          you eat the fucking thing!

                    STU
          Fuck off or I'll call a cop.

                    LEON
          Do you see one around here?  What
          you think I'm gonna be doing while
          you're waiting for a prowl car to
          get assigned?  I'm about to cut you
          a second asshole if you don't
          vacate those premises.

                    STU
          I can't.

                    FELICIA
          He's got him a fucking cellular. 
          What's he need to be on our booth
          for?

                    STU
          I can't explain it.

                    LEON
          I'm not interested in your
          explanations even if you had any.

     He withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn't
     open it -- yet.

                    LEON
          If I flick this, I use it.

                    STU
          I'll make it worth your while to go
          away.  How much do you want?

                    LEON
          Make me an offer.

                    STU
          Thirty dollars.  It's all I've got
          in cash.  Take it and go.

                    LEON
          You're offering to rent my phone
          booth?  For how long?

                    STU
          I don't know.  For as long as it
          takes.

                    LEON
          What's so special in there?

                    STU
          Do you want the money?

                    LEON
          Is that a genuine Rolex you've got
          on?

                    STU
          Come on, man.  That's my good
          watch.

                    LEON
          That's what it's gonna take.

                    STU
          Then here.  Take the damn thing.

                    LEON
          And the thirty!

                    STU
          Take it all.

     The pimp pockets the watch and the money.  But doesn't go
     away.

                    LEON
          Now I'm satisfied.  But you still
          got to deal with Felicia here.  I
          believe you spoke harshly to her.

                    STU
          I apologize.

                    LEON
          And did her some injury.

                    STU
          An accident.  I'm sorry about that,
          too.

                    FELICIA
          The man don't sound like he means
          it.

                    LEON
          I agree.
               (to Stu)
          Why don't you hang up a minute so
          we can discuss this matter at
          length.

                    STU
          It's long distance.  I can't lose
          the call -- I might not get them
          back.

                    LEON
          Do I have to rip that fucking phone
          out of there?

                    STU
          That wouldn't be a good idea.
               (into pay phone)
          Would it?

                    VOICE
          Not at all.

                    STU
          I gave you everything I've got.

                    LEON
          That pinky ring looks attractive. 
          Felicia might like that.

                    FELICIA
          It might fit.

                    STU
          You want the ring, you've got the
          ring.  If I can get it off.

                    LEON
          I can get it off you.

     Leon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand.

                    STU
          Let go of me!  It's coming loose. 
          There.
               (he tosses it)
          Okay, Felicia, with my deepest
          apologies.  Goodbye now.

                    LEON
          What's really going on in that
          booth -- that escapes the naked
          eye?

                    STU
          Nothing.  Talk.  That's all.

                    LEON
          That your connection on the end of
          the line?  Or are you dealing?

                    STU
          This has nothing to do with drugs.

                    LEON
          You gotta be high on something to
          willingly divest yourself of your
          valuables -- just to maintain
          occupancy of a fucking phone booth
          that the local bums piss in every
          night.

                    STU
          I knew it smelled for some reason.

                    LEON
          You look like you're ready to piss
          yourself.

                    STU
          Because I am.

                    LEON
          Maybe if the city provided decent
          public toilets, folks wouldn't
          relieve themselves in the subway
          stations and phone booths!

                    STU
          I'll take it up with the mayor.

                    LEON
          Next thing you know you're gonna
          claim we mugged you -- took your
          billfold and watch.

                    STU
          No, you didn't.  It was a fair and
          equitable deal.  You had
          territorial rights to this booth
          and I paid a license fee.  Fair is
          fair.  Now leave me in peace.

                    LEON
          You sure you're alright?
               (to Felicia)
          He don't look well.

                    FELICIA
          Kind of pale.  Even for a white
          man.

                    LEON
          Jaundice they calls it.  Probably
          advanced liver trouble.
               (to Stu)
          If it's cirrhosis, you better find
          yourself a twelve step program and
          quick.

                    STU
          Thanks for your interest but I'm in
          perfect health.

                    FELICIA
          So how come his hand is shaking?

                    LEON
          The man is cracking up.

                    FELICIA
          Lookit the sweat pouring off the
          sonofabitch.  That's one sick
          mother you started up with, Leon!

                    LEON
          Me?  You're the one that brought me
          over and exposed me to all his
          germs.

                    STU
          I'm terminal, okay?  Now can I
          close the booth and continue my
          conversation?

                    LEON
          I'm worried now it might be
          catching.  All that money out of
          your sweaty pocket is probably
          crawling with some rare and
          incurable disease.

                    STU
          Fine.  Give it back.

                    LEON
          What good's that?  We done touched
          it.

                    STU
          Well go wash your hands.

                    LEON
          Come on now.  Own up to what you're
          carrying.  Is it some of that
          sexually transmitted shit?  Cause
          in that case, we can relax.

                    STU
          I'm sick of you.  Now get out of my
          face.

                    LEON
          Here we's being solicitous as to
          your health and you respond by
          heaping abuse!

                    FELICIA
          Whip his arrogant ass.

     Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket.

                    STU
          Touch me and I'll throw up on you.

     At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly.

     It looks like a stalemate.  Stu isn't vacating the booth and
     Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further.  He
     does indeed look sick.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          You can see what I'm up against
          here.

                    VOICE
          Want me to get rid of him for you?

                    STU
          What do you have in mind?

                    VOICE
          I'll think of something.

     Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp.

     Leon doesn't realize it's there.  The hooker behind him has
     no way of seeing it.  But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. 
     He reacts.

                    STU
          God -- no.
               (into pay phone)
          Don't.  It's not necessary.

                    VOICE
          You asked for my help.

                    STU
          I'll handle it myself.

                    VOICE
          You're not doing too well.  I can
          settle it in a fraction of a
          second.  Shall I demonstrate?

                    STU
          No.
               (to Leon)
          For your own safety, mister, just
          walk away.

                    LEON
          Now the man is turning
          aggressive... issuing threats upon
          my person.

                    STU
          You're making this happen.

                    LEON
          If you don't hang up and step out,
          I'm about to topple this booth into
          the gutter with you inside it.

     Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. 
     He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its
     foundation.  And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It
     starts rocking back and forth.

     Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          This isn't my fault.
               (shouts)
          Stop that!

     But Leon continues rocking the booth.  It won't come loose --
     so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass.

     The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to
     shield himself from the slivers.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          The guy's insane!

                    VOICE
          Only one way to stop a mad dog. 
          Give me permission.

                    STU
          I can't.

                    VOICE
          If he forces you out of that booth,
          I've told you what to expect.  You
          or him, Stu.

     Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after
     another -- as Stu cowers inside.

                    FELICIA
          Don't cut yourself, honey.

     A crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to
     watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth
     and its occupant.

                    DERELICT
          Looks like the fucker is comin'
          loose.

                    STREET PERSON
          Shove it out into the oncoming
          traffic.

                    DERELICT
          What'll you bet the bus could knock
          that fifty feet?

     The booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          Hello?  Hello?

                    VOICE
               (with heavy static)
          You're breaking up.  We're about to
          be cut off.

                    STU
          I can't help it!

                    VOICE
          That counts as a hang-up.

                    STU
          No.  It can't.  That's not fair.

                    VOICE
          I can still make him stop.  Say the
          word.  Can you hear me?

                    STU
          Yes.

     Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues
     to barrage the booth with punches and kicks.

     Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward.  He doesn't
     realize he's been shot.

     There's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was
     used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary
     discharge.

     Leon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea
     he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people
     who've assembled on the corner.

     Even Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the
     wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest.

     He isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep
     his balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for
     support -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs
     down the side of the booth.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          You did it!

                    VOICE
          You said 'yes.'

                    STU
          I said 'Yes, I can hear you.'  Not
          'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'

                    VOICE
          Don't try to renege on it.  I was
          following orders.

                    STU
          You're twisting it all around.  I
          didn't do this!

     Meanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth.  Then his
     legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees.

     Felicia runs up beside him.  She sees the blood.

                    FELICIA
          I warned you not to cut yourself.
               (to crowd)
          Look at all that blood.  He must've
          hit an artery.

     She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement.  Now
     his chest wound is evident.

                    FELICIA
          Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  Talk to
          me!  What happened?

     The crowd tightens around the fallen body.  Street people who
     are fascinated but not shocked.

                    DERELICT
          Gunshot!

                    STREET PERSON
          Yeah.  Sucking chest wound right
          over the heart.

                    FELICIA
          Somebody call an ambulance.

                    STREET PERSON
          Call the meatwagon.  He's fucked
          up.

                    FELICIA
          You shut the fuck up!

     Her focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth.

                    FELICIA
          Why did you do that to him?

                    STU
          I didn't.

                    FELICIA
               (to crowd)
          You all saw it!  He shot my man
          without no provocation!

                    DERELICT
          Yeah.  Pumped one right into him at
          close range.

                    STU
          How could I?  I don't even have a
          gun.  Look!

                    STREET PERSON
          Everybody get the fuck back!  They
          shoot one -- then they shoot
          everybody in sight!  Kill all the
          fucking witnesses!

     The crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out
     of immediate range.

                    STU
          Come back.  You've got to see --
          I'm not armed.

     Only Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp's body, staring
     helplessly.

                    FELICIA
          Hang up and dial 911.  Get a
          doctor!

                    STU
          I can't hang up.  That's what this
          is all about.

                    FELICIA
          You're gonna stand there and let
          him die?

                    STU
               (takes out cellular)
          I can use this.
               (he dials)
          Emergency.  Yes.  There's been a
          shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth 
          -- on the corner.  A man is down. 
          What's the difference who I am?  I
          don't want to be involved.

                    FELICIA
               (shouts)
          That's bullshit.  He's the shooter. 
          You're talking to the shooter.

     Stu quickly disconnects the cellular.

                    STU
          That wasn't nice.

                    FELICIA
          Go ahead -- make a fucking run for
          it.  I hope they gun you down --
          like you did him!

                    STU
          I'm not going anyplace.  I'm
          staying right here in this booth.
               (into pay phone)
          Unless you give me permission.

                    VOICE
          You're attracting a lot of
          attention.  I suppose when the
          police get there, you'll accuse me.

                    STU
          What do you expect me to say?

                    VOICE
          That's up to you.  But any mention
          of me will not be appreciated.

                    STU
          You mean...?

                    VOICE
          You won't even get to finish your
          sentence.  Oh look, that little red
          dot is dancing around all over you
          again.  You saw how quickly it can
          happen.  And how accurate I can be.

                    STU
          They can't blame me -- I'm not
          armed.

                    VOICE
          Who's going to believe that?  With
          all those witnesses to the
          contrary.

                    STU
          They can see with their own eyes.

     Not far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing
     closer.

                    VOICE
          Remember to leave me out of it.

                    STU
          How can I?

                    VOICE
          You'll put the proper spin on it. 
          Isn't that your specialty?  Feeding
          the public a story that may not
          have a shred of truth -- and making
          it totally believable?

                    STU
          This isn't a story.  This is real. 
          This is murder.

                    VOICE
          If you'd only dealt with the man
          reasonably, shown him some respect,
          this might not have been necessary.

                    STU
          I gave him my money, my watch...

                    VOICE
          But not your respect.  Which is
          what he required of you.

                    STU
          He was a fucking thief.

                    VOICE
          And now he's a fucking dead thief. 
          Do you feel better about that?

                    STU
          I don't feel a bit guilty.  This is
          all your doing!

                    VOICE
          Now you're being disrespectful of
          me.  You never learn.  Your job is
          to deal with people -- but you're
          not good at it.

                    STU
          Hey, I'm not taking any more
          criticism from some lunatic sniper
          who gets his kicks killing
          strangers.

                    VOICE
          You keep insisting I'm a stranger. 
          Probably because you don't
          recognize the voice.  But there are
          cheap electronic devices available
          that disguise the voice.  I might
          not even be a man.  I might be one
          of those many women you've almost
          totally forgotten.  One who doesn't
          forgive easily.  One who wants to
          watch you squirm.

                    STU
          You're a man.  I know you're a man. 
          Women don't kill with telescopic
          rifles.  They stab you.

                    VOICE
          You sound so sure of that.  But
          you've never provoked any man as
          much as have the women in your
          life.  And so many of them, Stu.
               (a beat)
          Do you even remember their names?

                    STU
          I've got no time to rehash my whole
          life.  Oh my God!  The cops are
          here.

     Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue.

     Traffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now
     blocked the streets.

     PRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective
     without intercuts.

     Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.

                    FELICIA
               (pointing)
          That's him -- in the booth.  He's
          got a gun!

     As she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body
     out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue.

     It's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the
     maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being
     rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of
     irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their
     simplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that
     echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels...

     As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.

                    SERGEANT
               (into bullhorn)
          Throw down your weapon and come out
          with your hands raised.

                    STU
               (into phone)
          They're ordering me to come out.

                    VOICE
          I can see that.  Ignore them.

                    STU
          What if they open fire?

                    VOICE
          They probably won't.  Look across
          on the east side of the street.  Do
          you see the tourist with the home
          video camera?

     STU'S POV

     A distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner
     behind the police cars.  Some tourist is capturing the event
     on video.

     BACK TO STU

                    STU
          What about him?

                    VOICE
          He's going to keep the police on
          their best behavior.  So long as
          you don't take what could be
          interpreted as hostile action,
          you'll be safe.

                    STU
          You call this safe?  Six cops with
          guns pointed my way?

                    VOICE
          You want me to reduce them to three
          -- or two?

                    STU
          Absolutely no more shooting.  Now
          is that clear?

                    VOICE
          You can always change your mind.

                    SERGEANT
               (with bullhorn)
          You know the drill.  Hands clasped
          behind the back of your neck --
          moving slowly -- step out of the
          booth.  If we see any sign of a
          weapon, we will respond.

                    STU
               (shouts)
          You won't, because there isn't any.

                    SERGEANT
               (bullhorn)
          I repeat.  Raise your hands.

                    STU
          I can't.  I'm on a phone call.

     Now a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of
     the situation.

                    CAPTAIN RAMEY
          You have thirty seconds to comply.

                    STU
          I told you.  I'm busy.  Come back
          later.

                    VOICE
          Very good, Stu.

     The cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly
     in their sights.  He has no place to hide.  He's in the
     battered phone booth in plain view from all sides.

                    RAMEY
          You've been given an order.

     The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer.

     PRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always
     from Stu's POV.  But we can hear their voices and all that is
     said as if they were in close up.  It has an odd, unreal and
     distancing effect.

                    SERGEANT
          We're dealing with a mental case. 
          He's looking for us to kill him.

                    RAMEY
          Well he's not getting his wish.

     In the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team
     of medics jump out.  They rush to Leon's body.  (Again we
     hear their voices close, even though visually they are far
     off.)

                    FELICIA
          Tell me he's gonna be alright.

                    MEDIC
          Step aside.  Let us look at him.

     The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim.  He's
     DOA.

                    MEDIC
          Nothing we can do.  Don't touch the
          body.  They'll need it to mark the
          crime scene.

     Far across the street, the Captain confers with his
     subordinates.  They are small figures on the screen but we
     hear them sharply.

                    SERGEANT
          Same corner as two weeks ago.

                    RAMEY
          Maybe it's more than a coincidence. 
          Cover me.  I need to talk to him.

                    SERGEANT
          You've got your vest on?

                    RAMEY
          What do you think?

     The Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the
     phone booth.  He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away.

                    RAMEY
          I'm not armed.

                    STU
          Neither am I.

                    RAMEY
          Yeah, sure.  I need to know what
          happened.

                    STU
          Can't talk about it.

                    RAMEY
          Sure you can.  My name's Ramey. 
          Captain Ed Ramey.  What's yours?

                    STU
          Look, I don't want to be friends.

                    RAMEY
          You look like you need a friend.

                    VOICE
          Tell him you've already got a
          friend.

                    STU
               (yells)
          I've got a friend, okay.

                    RAMEY
          Is that who you're talking to on
          the phone?

                    STU
          None of your business.

                    RAMEY
          When somebody gets shot, it becomes
          my business.  Let's not have
          anybody else killed.  I want to
          hear your side of it.

                    STU
          I've got no side of it.

                    VOICE
          Don't worry, Stu.  I've got him
          fixed right in my sights.  I won't
          let him hurt you.

                    RAMEY
          Has this happened to you before? 
          The need to hurt someone?  To put a
          bullet in them?

                    STU
          You won't believe anything I say.

                    RAMEY
          Try me.

                    STU
          I couldn't shoot anybody.  I'm not
          armed.

                    RAMEY
          You're right.  I don't believe you. 
          What's that bulge in your pants
          pocket?

                    STU
          That?  That's my cellular.

                    RAMEY
          A cellular?  Then what are you
          doing in a phone booth making
          calls?

                    STU
          Do you want to see it?

                    RAMEY
          Don't reach for it, mister.

                    STU
          Then how can I show it to you?

                    RAMEY
          I don't need to see it.  I know
          what's there.  All these witnesses
          saw you use it on him.

     From behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out.

                    STREET PERSON
               (hollers)
          Damn straight!

     Another DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in.

                    DERELICT
               (shouts)
          Yeah!  Shot him down like a dog!

                    STU
          They're all lying.  Nobody saw it
          because it didn't happen.

                    RAMEY
          A man is dead but it didn't happen.

                    STU
          Not on account of me!  This is like
          some bad dream.

                    RAMEY
          You're walking through a bad dream
          and you can't wake up.  Do you want
          to wake up?

                    STU
          I'm trying.

                    RAMEY
          And in this dream, you killed that
          man.  He was bothering you so you
          iced him.

                    STU
          No.

                    RAMEY
          Then who did?

                    VOICE
          Don't tell him, Stu.  Or it'll be
          the last thing he ever hears.  His
          blood will be on your hands.

                    STU
               (to Ramey)
          I don't know.

                    RAMEY
          But you saw it happen?

                    STU
          Yes.

                    RAMEY
          You were the closest one to him. 
          You must've seen who did it.

                    STU
          No.

                    RAMEY
          We're trying to be honest with each
          other, aren't we?

                    STU
          Not necessarily.

                    VOICE
          I'm losing patience with this cop.

                    STU
               (into phone)
          I'm handling this.

                    RAMEY
          Who do you keep talking to on the
          phone?

                    STU
          Nobody.  My psychiatrist.

                    VOICE
          Excellent, Stu.  You're getting
          good at this.

                    RAMEY
          What's this doctor's name?  It's
          important we know.

                    STU
          He says not to tell you.  It's
          privileged information.

                    VOICE
          Damn good reply.  Now you're having
          fun.  Admit it.

                    STU
          Whatever you say.

                    VOICE
          Playing it so close to the edge. 
          I'll bet you've never felt so
          alive.  That's how I feel when I
          look through the sight and select
          somebody.

     The Captain begins advancing a few steps closer.

                    RAMEY
          I respect your right to privacy. 
          I've been to therapy myself.  The
          department provides it.  I know
          it's not good form for a cop to be
          admitting that, but...

                    VOICE
          Tell him not to come any closer.

                    STU
          Stop right there.  Back up a few
          steps.  Back where you were.

                    RAMEY
          If it makes you more comfortable.

                    VOICE
          Tell him to read you your rights.

                    STU
          I want you to read me my rights and
          stop asking questions.

                    RAMEY
          Al least tell me your first name.

                    STU
          It's my right not to have any name.

                    RAMEY
          No gun and no name.  You're a
          highly underprivileged person.

                    VOICE
          Demand a lawyer.

                    STU
          And get me a lawyer, too.  I want a
          lawyer brought down here to
          negotiate my surrender.

                    VOICE
          Brilliant, Stu.  Keep winging it.

                    RAMEY
          It'll be hard to find a lawyer
          willing to risk his life.  But if
          you hand over the gun...

                    STU
          How can I when you won't let me
          take it out?

                    RAMEY
          We'll take it out for you -- as
          soon as you exit the booth with
          your hands raised and...

                    STU
               (interrupts)
          Now we're back to that again.  It's
          always "Get out of the booth.' 
          'You can't stay in the booth.' 
          Well, I like it in the fucking
          booth.  It's my whole world now. 
          It's my booth and I'm never coming
          out.

                    RAMEY
          We're not about to force you
          because there could be a
          miscalculation and then we'd never
          find out why this happened.

                    STU
          Why is it so important to know? 
          The guy is dead.  Isn't that
          enough?  Knowing isn't going to
          make him alive again.  So who gives
          a fuck!

                    RAMEY
          It's what makes the job
          interesting.  Finding out why. 
          Something drove you to do this. 
          You didn't go out today expecting
          this to happen.  It was a nice day. 
          You were out for a walk.  And then
          suddenly it all changed.

                    STU
          All I wanted was to make a phone
          call.  One lousy phone call for
          thirty-five fucking cents.

                    VOICE
          Careful, Stu.  Don't volunteer too
          much.

                    RAMEY
          You got some bad news on that call.

                    STU
          The worst.

                    RAMEY
          Something that pushed you over the
          edge?

                    STU
          And I've been falling ever since.

                    RAMEY
          Time to land.

                    STU
          When you hit bottom, you die.

                    RAMEY
          I'm your safety net.

                    STU
          If I tell you what you want to know
          -- you'll die, too.

     Something about the implied threat sends a chill through
     Captain Ramey.

     INSERT SHOT

     The Captain's head as seen through a telescopic sight.

     Ramey could be dead in an instant.

     PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu's
     perspective is when we see the sniper's POV through his
     scope.

     ANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH,

     the detective fifteen feet away.

     Ramey decides to back off momentarily.

                    RAMEY
          I'll go see about that lawyer.

                    STU
          Now that's a good idea.

     The Captain withdraws back across the street.

                    VOICE
          He's lucky.  I had him centered in
          my cross hairs.  I really had to
          restrain myself.

     We hear the approach of a helicopter.

     Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above
     the tall buildings.

                    VOICE
          It's not the police.  It's the
          media.  You're news, Stuart.

     The helicopters circle above.

                    VOICE
          You've never gotten this much press
          for any of your clients.  I'm
          making you a famous person.

                    STU
          They're just hoping for coverage of
          me dying in the gutter.

                    VOICE
          Their presence is putting the
          police on their continued best
          behavior.

                    STU
          Those cops are just looking for any
          excuse.

                    VOICE
          Then don't give them one.

     Then, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts
     ringing.

     But he can't allows himself to reach for it.  To do so might
     cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun.

     It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth. 
     Drowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police
     radios and the newly introduced sound of television
     helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage
     of the event below.

                    VOICE
          Who could it be?

                    STU
          Kelly.  She was worried about me.

     Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's
     going for a gun.

                    VOICE
          Maybe she's seen this on
          television.  It must be on every
          channel by now.  Breaking news.

                    STU
          She doesn't watch daytime TV.

                    VOICE
          One of the neighbors could've
          alerted her.

     The cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound
     of helicopters circling overhead.

                    STU
          Why are you saying this?  You want
          me to reach in my pocket so you can
          see them open fire?

                    VOICE
          That's an unwarranted accusation
          and very unbecoming in light of the
          good advice I've given in the past. 
          Have I ever steered you wrong?

                    STU
          God -- how I'd love to hear her
          voice.

                    VOICE
          It might even be worth it.  She's
          insistent, isn't she?

     The cellular won't stop ringing.

                    STU
          If she knows I'm in trouble, she
          won't give up.

                    VOICE
          Probably glued to the TV by now. 
          I'm watching coverage on two
          stations now.  Channel surfing.
               (pause)
          Well, there you are on two and four
          and five.  Not any decent angles on
          you, though, stuck inside there.

     The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is
     maddening.  Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide
     the cops with an excuse to open fire.

                    VOICE
          But if you'd take one or two steps
          outside and look up, I think they
          could get a clear picture of you.

                    STU
          You said I'm not allowed to leave
          the booth.

     Finally the cell phone stops ringing.

                    VOICE
          I might be willing to bend the
          rules and let you enjoy your moment
          of fame.  Set the phone down
          without hanging up... and take a
          step or two outside.  Just for a
          minute.  Then come straight back in
          or I'll be forced to provide 'live'
          coverage that should rival the
          historic Zapruder footage.
               (beat)
          Nothing like an exploding head to
          excite viewer interest.

                    STU
          No, thanks.  I'll stay where I am.

                    VOICE
          It was only a suggestion.  Since
          you're convinced I'm going to plug
          you anyway, it can't matter much.

                    STU
          If you shoot me, you give yourself
          away.

                    VOICE
          Even without a muffler, they'd
          never hear the report with all this
          noise.  Afterwards, it'd take them
          a good ten minutes to realize you
          weren't plugged by some overzealous
          officer.  Then they'll blame the
          media for inciting a crackpot
          vigilante to come down here and do
          the SWAT team's job for them.

                    STU
          You expected them to come.  You had
          this all worked out.

                    VOICE
          I write the scenario and you all
          play your parts -- as directed.

     The damned cell phone starts beeping again.  Stu fights the
     temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last
     time.

                    STU
          Poor Kelly.  What she must be going
          through.

                    VOICE
          Why don't you tell her how you feel
          about her?

                    STU
          I'd never get the words out.  Not
          with fifteen or twenty rounds in
          me.

                    VOICE
          You can't be certain they'd fire. 
          They'd see it was only a phone.

                    STU
          They wouldn't wait to see.

     The cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves.

                    STU
          Why doesn't she hang up?

     Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across
     the street behind the police barricades.  Countless faces
     rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of
     violence that would end with him face down dead on the
     pavement.

     And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him.  A
     female, quite pretty... even in tears.  It's Kelly.  (We see
     her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green
     jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.)

                    STU
          It's her!  She's not calling me. 
          She's over there.

                    VOICE
          Is she?

                    STU
          The blonde girl in the green
          jacket.

                    VOICE
          Can't miss her.  Very attractive,
          isn't she?

                    STU
          She must've heard all the commotion
          and come downstairs.

     The cellular is still ringing.

                    STU
          It's somebody else who knows my
          cell number.
               (beat)
          It's you!

                    VOICE
          You continue to impress.

                    STU
          Why is it so important that they
          kill me?

                    VOICE
          Because that's how I win.

                    STU
          This time you won't.  If you want
          me dead, you'll have to do it
          yourself.

                    VOICE
          Either way I can't lose.

                    STU
          It's all a game to you -- because
          you're incapable of feelings. 
          You're not even human.

                    VOICE
          I pride myself on that.  What's so
          great about being human?  It's the
          lowest form of life on this planet
          and I've taken it upon myself to
          thin the herd.

                    STU
          I quit.  I'm not answering back any
          more.  I won't hang up but I'm not
          playing.

     There's silence now between them.

                    VOICE
          Stu?  Stu, don't be that way. 
          You're taking the pleasure out of
          it.

     Stu doesn't take the bait.  He remains absolutely silent.

     A stalemate has been reached.

     WE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE

     clustered behind an emergency vehicle.  The Sergeant brings a
     civilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit.  The
     newcomer wears coveralls stenciled "AT&T."  (Although they
     are very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come
     into sharper focus.)

                    SERGEANT
          This here's Helfand, of New York
          Telephone.

                    HELFAND
          Glad to help out.

                    RAMEY
          Have you got the number of that
          booth?

                    HELFAND
          Sure do.

                    RAMEY
          Can you tap into that call?

                    HELFAND
          It can be done.

                    SERGEANT
          But not without a warrant.  You
          could be violating this psycho's
          civil rights.  Especially if he's
          on the line with his fucking
          psychiatrist.

                    RAMEY
          Shit.  I don't want to blow this on
          a technicality.  Tracing the call
          isn't any violation, is it?

                    SERGEANT
          As long as we don't listen in.

     We remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in
     heated conversation.

                    RAMEY
               (to Helfand)
          Okay, we've got to know who he's
          talking to and their current
          location.

                    HELFAND
          That I can handle.  As long as they
          keep the circuit open.

                    RAMEY
          I need the number and an address to
          go with it.

     Helfand rushes off.  At the corner, we can glimpse him
     entering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth
     Street.

     RACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH

     Stu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his
     tormentor the conversation he so craves.

                    VOICE
          Stuart, my friend.  Do you want to
          see how close I can come without
          actually hitting you?

     Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more
     powerful.

     There's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late
     Leon smashed it all out.

     Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot.

                    VOICE
          May I call attention to the yellow
          pages?

     The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the
     telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit.

     There's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there
     to behold.

     Stu reaches for the phonebook.

     There's a bullet hole straight through it.  Pieces of the .30
     calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are
     imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick
     volume.

     Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory.  He looks
     at them in the palm of his hand.

                    VOICE
          Hollow points are designed to break
          up on impact.  It would've behaved
          differently if it had pierced your
          soft flesh.  The pieces would've
          bounced around looking for a way
          out.  That's where the real damage
          occurs -- finding an exit --
          deflecting off all that bone...

     Stu wants to shout "STOP," but restrains himself.  Not
     talking gives him some degree of power.

                    VOICE
          Still the silent treatment?  My
          father used to dish that out when
          he chose to punish me.  Not a word
          spoken -- one time for over a
          month.  I'd try and goad him to
          acknowledge I existed, but he
          stared right through me.  You're
          bringing back unhappy childhood,
          Stu.  That's not wise.

     Stu still declines to answer.  His silence seems his only
     weapon.  He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto
     the pavement.

                    VOICE
          Since you're ignoring me, I'll
          focus on someone else.
               (a beat)
          There she is -- nice and sharp.  I
          can see the two little punctures in
          each earlobe and my God, what kind
          of a girl would have her nostril
          pierced?

     Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights.

                    STU
          No!

                    VOICE
          What was that?  Louder, Stu.  We
          must have a bad connection.

                    STU
          Leave her out of it.

                    VOICE
          I didn't expect her to show up
          here.  But since she has -- I'll
          improvise.

                    STU
          Don't.  Please don't.  I'm sorry. 
          I'm talking to you again.  I'll
          talk all you want!

                    VOICE
          It's a bad dye job.  The black
          roots are growing in and it makes
          her look cheap.

                    STU
          I've screwed up her life enough
          already.  Please don't hurt her.

                    VOICE
          I don't necessarily have to kill
          her.  I could be persuaded to
          settle for a reasonable mutilation.
          Which part of her displeases you
          most?  If she turns a bit more in
          profile, I'm accurate enough to
          remove the tip of her unpleasantly
          protruding nose.  It's just
          cartilage.  Any decent cosmetic
          surgeon will have her looking
          better than ever.

     STU'S POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY

     in the crowd.  Distant yet distinct amongst the curious
     onlookers.

     JUMP CUT

     CLOSER ON KELLY -- OBLIVIOUS TO HER DANGER.

     AS SEEN THROUGH CROSS HAIRS OF TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward
     the police officers.

     Her face virtually fills the screen.

     PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu and his
     POV is when we see the sniper's own POV through his
     telescopic sight.

                    VOICE
          You can see her talking to the
          police now.  She's identifying
          herself as your wife.  They're very
          interested in who you are.  They're
          taking her over to see the officer
          in charge.  What was his name?

     SNIPER'S POV

     Through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, we can see Kelly
     conversing with Captain Ramey.  She's in a state of complete
     agitation.

     ANGLE ON STU

     half leaning out of the booth, staring at his wife and the
     cops in the distance.

     RACK FOCUS TO THEM --

     and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the
     distance.

                    KELLY
          What do you mean psychiatrist?  He
          doesn't see any psychiatrist.

                    RAMEY
          Then who'd your husband be talking
          to?

                    KELLY
          There was some guy that called the
          house this morning and said weird
          stuff to me.

                    RAMEY
          Stu seems to be checking things out
          with this person.

                    KELLY
          He hasn't got many friends -- I can
          tell you that.

                    RAMEY
          Remain here, please.  We may need
          you later.

                    KELLY
          You won't hurt him?

                    RAMEY
          We'll do our best not to.

     Kelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command
     center.

     Kelly is once again a solitary target.  She could be picked
     off without attracting undue attention.

                    VOICE
          She won't even feel it when it
          happens.

     BACK TO PHONE BOOTH

                    STU
          Take me instead.

                    VOICE
          Don't distract me.  Now's the time
          to be absolutely still.  I have to
          hold my breath as I squeeze
          gently --

                    STU
          No!  I'm hanging up.  That's it.

     Stu hangs up the receiver.  He disconnects.

     RACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT --

     The police as they react.  We see a flurry of activity across
     the street.  Voices become clear as focus shifts.

                    RAMEY
          Shit.  He hung up.

                    SERGEANT
          Maybe they already traced it. 
          Anyhow, it doesn't matter.  Looks
          like he's coming out.

     RACK FOCUS BACK TO STU --

     slowly stepping out of the booth.  His hands are raised.

                    STU
               (shouts)
          I've giving myself up.  Take me!

                    SWAT OFFICER
               (distant)
          First the gun.  We want to see you
          toss away your weapon!

                    STU
          Shit.  I can't.

                    SWAT OFFICER
               (distant)
          Freeze where you are!  Turn around
          and keep those hands clasped.
               (signals the others)
          Take him.

     The SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover
     and fan out as they approach the booth.

     TIGHTER ON STU

     He's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's
     bullet go through him at any moment.

     Then the pay phone starts ringing.

     The sniper is calling back.

     RACK FOCUS AGAIN

     to the police.

     All the cops react.  Particularly the Captain and the
     Sergeant.  Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in
     focus.

                    SERGEANT
          What is going on with these fucking
          phone calls?

                    RAMEY
               (shouts)
          Hold your fire.  Let him answer it.

     The SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim.

                    SERGEANT
          Are you nuts?

                    RAMEY
          Let them talk.  He's not going
          anywhere.
               (shouts)
          He's going back inside the booth.

     Indeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick
     up the receiver.

     FOCUS RETURNS TO STU

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          Yeah?

     A strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish.  Totally
     unintelligible to Stu.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          You got the wrong number.  Hang up.

     The voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in
     Spanish.

                    STU
          Wrong number.  Wrong number.

     Then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic
     accent.  It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor.

                    VOICE
          Aw, relax, Stu.  Only yanking your
          chain.  Now can we start over?

                    STU
          Those cops won't wait much longer.

                    VOICE
          What else can they do?  They can't
          afford to just shoot you like I
          can.  Not with so much media
          coverage.  Not unless you make some
          stupid aggressive move.
               (beat)
          The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up.

     Across the street, Stu can see various TV units from local
     stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks.

                    STU
          Will you look at that?  I must be
          going out over the network.  Bet
          they're pre-empting usual
          programming.

                    VOICE
          And just think -- if you survive
          this, your trial will be televised. 
          And you can try and make the world
          believe I ever existed.  I'd be
          your only defense.

                    STU
          How are they gonna prove that I
          killed anybody when there's no gun?

                    VOICE
          They'll plant one.  The police
          aren't above that -- when they're
          desperate to convict.

                    STU
          No, sir.  No gun and I walk.

                    VOICE
          Don't you think I took that into
          account?  Am I a fool?

                    STU
          What do you mean?

                    VOICE
          Haven't I considered every
          eventuality?  I knew they'd come
          and cordon off the block.
               (beat)
          And that there'd have to be a gun
          someplace.

                    STU
          Where?

                    VOICE
          It's a small booth, Stu.  Have you
          checked every inch of it?

                    STU
               (looking up and down)
          It's not on the floor.

                    VOICE
          Then what's left?

                    STU
          Up above.

                    VOICE
          Could be.  Why don't you reach up
          there and lift the plastic sheet --
          and feel around.

                    STU
          If they see me reach for something,
          they could open fire.

                    VOICE
          They could.  But you have to know
          if it's there.  Don't you?

                    STU
          I totally don't give a shit.

                    VOICE
          In a narrow space, tucked just to
          the left of the fluorescent bulb. 
          You can almost see it outlined if
          you look closely.

     Stu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and
     dirty.  There are shadows of objects above in the shallows
     area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when
     the door to the phone booth is tightly closed.

     Stu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light
     click on -- watching the shadows around the light.

     Could that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects? 
     Or could something be stashed up there?

                    STU
          It doesn't matter.  I know about
          ballistics.  The slug in that dead
          guy came from your rifle, not any
          handgun.

                    VOICE
          You saw how hollow points splinter
          on impact.  There's nothing much
          for ballistics to match to.  The
          same make .30 calibre bullets are
          in that handgun.  The prosecution
          rests.

                    STU
          There's no gun up there.  I don't
          see a damn thing.

                    VOICE
          Slide your finger up under the
          plastic and you'll feel the cold
          metal surface.  There are four
          rounds left in it.  Should you
          decide to shoot your way out.

                    STU
          I could never shoot anybody.

                    VOICE
          You could shoot me, Stu.  You'd do
          that in a minute if you could.

                    STU
          And I'd fucking love it!

                    VOICE
          Now you're speaking from the heart. 
          Come on, just lift the partition a
          few inches and feel what's there
          for you.

                    STU
          I'm not getting my fingerprints on
          your fucking weapon.  What about
          powder residue?  How are they going
          to explain that to a jury?

                    VOICE
          Do you think that'll matter with so
          many eye witnesses?
               (beat)
          Do it... or should I re-focus my
          attention on Kelly?

                    STU
          No.

                    VOICE
          You carefully distracted me from
          her before and I let you get away
          with it.  But if you're not going
          to play fairly --
               (a pause)
          There she is again.  So close I
          feel like I could touch her.

                    STU
          Get off her!

                    VOICE
          Then mind me when I speak.

                    STU
          Look!  I'm reaching up with my left
          hand.  I'm pushing against the
          partition.  It's giving.  I'm
          feeling around with my fingertips. 
          It's filthy up there.

     TIGHT SHOT - STU'S FINGERS

     feel about inside the shallow space.  The shriveled remains
     of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun.

                    STU
          I'm -- touching something.

                    VOICE
          One of the finest handguns
          Remington makes.  Lightweight,
          efficient and highly accurate.

                    STU
          I'm not picking it up.

                    VOICE
          Not right now.  But eventually...

     Stu lowers his hand, still empty.

                    STU
          I wouldn't have a chance.

                    VOICE
          I never said you would.

                    STU
          I'm not insane.

                    VOICE
          But you're getting there.  It
          wouldn't take much.

                    STU
          That won't happen.

                    VOICE
          You could pull the gun down, shove
          it in your own mouth and jerk the
          trigger.  That's another option.

                    STU
          Why would I do that?

                    VOICE
          To please me.  And ensure that
          nothing happens to Kelly.  I don't
          necessarily have to deal with her
          today in the midst of a crowd of
          cops.  I can take her out any time
          I like.  When she goes to pull down
          her blinds at night or when she
          walks the dog first thing in the
          morning.  What is it -- a Jack
          Russell?

                    STU
          Okay.  I know you can do it.  But
          don't talk about that.  Please.

                    VOICE
          I'd rather see you remembered as
          the gallant gunman who tried to
          shoot his way past an army of
          police -- than as a coward who
          sucked the barrel.  I'm doing your
          PR for you.  Creating a final image
          that'll endure.  The outraged New
          Yorker who was pushed too far. 
          When some lowlife street person
          tries to invade his territory, he
          retaliated.  And when the forces of
          the law closed in, he was
          defiant... to the end.

                    STU
          Like that nerdy sonofabitch who
          blew those three wiseass kids away
          on the subway?

                    VOICE
          Exactly.  Nobody minded that he was
          a sicko.  He was living out a New
          Yorker's pet fantasy.  Can you
          remember that movie where Peter
          Finch started screaming 'I'm not
          taking it anymore!'  And everybody
          picked up on it.

                    STU
          'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking
          it anymore.'

                    VOICE
          That was it.  Poor Finch got
          himself an Oscar for that.  But he
          was dead by then.  I mean he really
          died.  Maybe playing that part took
          too much out of him.

                    STU
               (softly to himself)
          'I'm not taking it anymore.'  'I'm
          not taking it anymore.'

                    VOICE
          That's the way!  Psyche yourself
          up.  Everybody respects a man who
          fights back, even if he goes a
          little berserk in the process.

                    STU
          Fighting back.  That's what it's
          about.

                    VOICE
          Exactly!  We all understand the
          poor schmuck that gets laid off and
          comes back and shoots all his
          bosses.  We all thought of doing
          that.  But only he had the balls. 
          The terminally ill husband who gets
          his policy canceled and machine
          guns the insurance company offices. 
          Maybe somebody will finally get the
          message.  You can fuck human beings
          over only for so long before they
          come back at you.  I'm still
          holding on Kelly and she looks very
          concerned.  I could relieve all
          that anguish in a fraction of a
          second.  Shall I?

     Stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man
     on the line has done to him.  His turn has come to fight
     back.  He has an idea.

     If the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu.

     Turning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his
     knees.

                    STU
          I'm on my knees begging you.

                    VOICE
          Stand up, Stu.  You're embarrassing
          yourself.

     TIGHT ANGLE --

     Stu now down on his knees in the booth.  He's curled up
     almost into a fetal position.

     By doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he's reaching
     into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone.

     He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the
     sniper or the cops.  But nothing happens.

                    VOICE
          Stu -- I want you back on your feet
          facing me.  So you can see what I'm
          going to do to her.

     Stu ignores the command.  He's quickly dialing.

     911.

     He's calling police emergency.

     SNIPER'S POV

     Stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope,
     crouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth.  But the cell
     phone is hidden in front of him.

                    VOICE
          Be a man, Stuart.  Don't let them
          see you like this.  You're an
          embarrassment to me.

     WIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH

     with Stu still kneeling.

     RACK FOCUS

     to police across the street as their voices become clear --

                    SERGEANT
               (listening to
               transmission)
          Officer on east side of the street
          reports subject removed a dark
          metallic object from his pocket. 
          We better move.

                    RAMEY
          Hold all fire until you actually
          identify a weapon.  We're doing
          this on fucking TV!

     RACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH

     crouched forward.  The pay phone receiver dangles just above
     his head.  The cellular remains cupped in his hand.

     Stu never lifts the cell phone.  He keeps the palm of his
     hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from
     the other end.

     It rings and finally someone answers.

                    EMERGENCY OPERATOR
               (faint)
          Police.  Is this an emergency? 
          Hello?  Is someone on the line?

     But Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he
     now grips in his other hand.  Hoping that his words will be
     picked up by the emergency operator listening via the
     cellular.  To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides
     the door to the booth tightly closed.

     He pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are
     meant for the 911 operator to hear.

                    STU
               (loud)
          You've made your point.  Who's
          going to believe I've got a sniper
          with a telescopic sight holding me
          in a fucking phone booth at 45th
          and 8th?

                    VOICE
          It took you a while to believe it
          yourself.

                    STU
          If you'd put a bullet in that
          Captain Ramey, it would've been a
          different story -- but you were too
          wise to do that.

                    VOICE
          Why don't you do it for me?  Wave
          the old captain back over and get
          him nice and close and then use the
          handgun on him.

                    STU
               (talking loud)
          Why me?  You could pick off any of
          those cops from your window up
          there.  Like you did that pimp. 
          And that tourist last week.  But
          this time you want me to do your
          killing for you.

                    VOICE
          And you will!  To save Kelly.

     EXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE

     cupped in Stu's hand and held low.  Can they hear him on the
     other end?

                    EMERGENCY OPERATOR
               (muffled, almost
               inaudible)
          Can you speak up, sir?  What is
          your name?

     Stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the
     emergency operator.  He sets the cell phone down flat on the
     floor of the booth facing upward.  He puts his foot over the
     receiving end to muffle the incoming voice.  Then he stands
     up.

                    VOICE
          That's better, Stu.  Now turn
          around so I can see you.

     Stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now.  But keeps
     his voice raised.

                    STU
          This booth.  It's my whole world --
          shrunk down to four feet by three
          feet.  Not much bigger than the
          size of a coffin.

                    VOICE
          They can put handles on the booth
          and bury you in it.

                    STU
               (loudly into pay phone)
          When I saw you put that bullet into
          that black dude, I knew you'd never
          let me out of this phone booth
          alive.

                    VOICE
          You're wasting my time.  Reach up
          and take the gun.

                    STU
               (peering upward,
               squinting)
          Let me see you first.  What harm
          can that do you?  You're in one of
          those windows.  I've got to know
          which one.

                    VOICE
          No need for that.

                    STU
          Being so far, I could never
          identify you.  I don't even want
          to.

                    VOICE
          What is it then?

                    STU
          Don't worry that I'd try to point
          you out.  You'd shut me up with one
          of your .30 calibre hollow points
          before I could even raise a finger.

                    VOICE
          Why does it matter so much?

                    STU
          I want to see that you exist.  Like
          God exists.  It's not enough to
          believe.  You want to see him --
          just once -- even at a distance.

                    VOICE
          And then you'd take the gun down. 
          And use it.  We have a deal on
          that?

                    STU
          Show yourself to me and I'll take
          the gun down.  I swear.

     There's a pause as the sniper mulls it over.

                    VOICE
          I don't have to make deals.  And
          you're irritating me by trying to
          negotiate.  God doesn't have to
          prove anything.  He just strikes
          you down when he gets in the mood.

                    STU
          Stop!  I won't ask to see you
          anymore.

                    VOICE
          I'm glad that's settled.  But look
          who else has showed up?

                    STU
          Who?

                    VOICE
          I guess she saw the coverage on TV
          and just couldn't keep away.

                    STU
          What are you talking about?

                    VOICE
          The 'hotel' just arrived.  And a
          very beautiful little hotel she is. 
          Actually, I'd classify her as more
          of a motel.

                    STU
          Mavis?  I don't see her.

                    VOICE
          She's too far back behind the
          police line.  But I've got a fine
          shot at her from up here.

                    STU
          You don't even know what she looks
          like.

                    VOICE
          You're in an enviable position now,
          Stu.  You get to choose between
          them.  Tell me which one.

                    STU
          I can't.

                    VOICE
          Which will it be?  Kelly or Mavis? 
          Or should I simply select one?

     INSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE

     lying face up on the floor of the booth.  Is anybody
     listening?

     BACK TO STU

     Stu looks down at the cellular.  He has no way of knowing if
     the police operator can hear any of his words.

                    STU
          I need time to think...

                    VOICE
          You've got to be more in touch with
          your feelings.  You said you love
          Kelly.

                    STU
          I do.

                    VOICE
          Then I'm doing you a favor putting
          you out of the way of temptation.

                    STU
          It wasn't Mavis' fault.  It was all
          my fault.

                    VOICE
          Then take the third option.  Reach
          above you and pick up the gun.

                    STU
          You'll leave them both alone?

                    VOICE
          There won't be much point in
          harming them without you around to
          impress.

                    STU
          I'll do it.

                    VOICE
          Let me see you do it.

                    STU
          I need one minute.  One last
          minute, please.  Can you give me
          that?

                    VOICE
          Don't tell me you're going to say
          your prayers?

                    STU
          Something like that.

     WE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE

     assembled on the opposite side of the street.

                    RAMEY
          They should've traced the fucking
          call by now.

                    SERGEANT
               (listening on transmitter)
          There's something else coming in. 
          A 911 operator says your name was
          mentioned by somebody that's still
          on the line.  Somebody talking
          about a phone booth.  And a sniper.

                    RAMEY
          Patch me through.  Hello, this is
          Captain Edward Ramey.  What about
          that call?

                    EMERGENCY OPERATOR
          The line is still open.  It's
          originating from a booth at 45th
          and 8th.

                    RAMEY
          We're there!  Can you play me back
          your recording of the entire call?

                    EMERGENCY OPERATOR
          I can't replay the tape while it's
          still running.

                    RAMEY
          Then switch to another machine and
          play back what you've got.

                    EMERGENCY OPERATOR
          It's awful faint.  He's not talking
          directly into the receiver.

     Ramey begins to listen.  We hear snatches of Stu's call
     picking up words which are at times incomprehensible.

                    STU'S VOICE
               (faint)
          'Who's going to believe I've got a
          sniper with a telescopic sight
          holding me in some fucking phone
          booth...'

     The uniformed TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN now joins Ramey and the
     Sergeant.

                    TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
          Got what you wanted.  The call's
          coming from up the street.  The
          Hotel Broadway.

                    RAMEY
          Have you got the room?

                    TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
          It's not that easy.  Electronic
          switchboard.

                    RAMEY
               (to Sergeant)
          Move your SWAT units to the hotel. 
          No... wait.  Any movement will
          alert the sniper.  If he sees any
          of us withdraw, he may panic.

                    SERGEANT
          There's another SWAT unit on the
          way.

                    RAMEY
          Intercept them.  Divert them to the
          hotel.

                    SERGEANT
          It's done.

                    RAMEY
          Send them in from the Forty-third
          Street side.  I don't want any
          activity the sniper might catch
          sight of.  He's probably high up
          and facing that booth.  He's got to
          continue to believe our full
          attention is focused on the man
          inside -- whoever the hell that
          poor bastard is.
               (to emergency operator)
          Hello 911 operator, I missed some
          of that.  Run it halfway back and
          repeat it.

                    STU'S VOICE (REPLAY)
               (faint)
          '... Like you did that pimp.  And
          that tourist last week.  But this
          time you want me to do the killing
          for you...'

                    RAMEY
               (listening)
          Jesus... he's a dead man.

     BACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH

                    VOICE
          The police seem all excited about
          something, Stu.

                    STU
          Are they?  I wasn't looking.

                    VOICE
          I can't wait any longer.  Say amen,
          then reach up for the gun.  When
          your hand comes down, I want to see
          it.

                    STU
          I'm too afraid.

                    VOICE
          For once, be brave.  Surprise
          yourself.

                    STU
          I'm shaking all over.

                    VOICE
          Guys in combat situations even shit
          their pants.  But they follow
          orders.

                    STU
          As soon as the cops see a gun,
          they'll open fire.

                    VOICE
          Then I'd advise you to fire first.

     Stu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower.

     His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that
     cover the roof of the booth.  It raises up easily at the
     middle where two sheets join.

     TIGHT INSERT SHOT

     The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of
     clouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture
     covered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking
     weapon.

     Now Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He
     touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the
     roughness of the grip.

     TIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE

     as below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --

     The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed
     tightly shut.  He can already imagine the police bullets
     tearing into him.

     A POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION.

                    POLICE SNIPER
               (into transmitter)
          Give me the word.

     RACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH

     His arm still raised.  He hasn't brought it down with the gun
     in it.  Not yet.  He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up
     against his mouth.

                    VOICE
          Hard part's over.  Drop your arm
          and point it like you'd point your
          finger and squeeze.

                    STU
          No.  You do it.  If you want me
          dead, then fucking murder me!

                    VOICE
          Why must I keep invoking some poor
          girl's name every time we come to
          an impasse?  I'm focused back on
          Kelly again.  You're obviously not
          willing to trade your life for
          hers.

                    STU
          I am!  I'm doing it!

     He pulls the handgun down into full view.  Curiously, the
     police do not open fire.

                    STU
          There!  You see it?  They all see
          it.

     He waves the gun so nobody can miss it.

                    STU
          Where are you?  Damn you!!

     He drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth.

     Still the cops do not open fire.

     Then Stu starts shooting.

     Not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the
     street.

     At the thousands of windows that look down upon him.

     He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out
     in response.

     RACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER

     He has fired.

     ANGLE ON STU

     The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters. 
     Stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the
     pavement.

     RACK FOCUS TO KELLY

     She screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH

     ANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER

     as it sways back and forth.  From it, we hear the voice.

                    VOICE
          Thanks for such an interesting
          afternoon.

     THEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING
     SWAYING PHONE.

     A wooden door being battered open.  A few incomprehensible
     shouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in.  Stu's stalling for time has
     paid off.

     THE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.

     THE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM.

     The police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has
     been a rapid exchange of shots.

     A HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver.

     ANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear.

                    RAMEY
          Hello?  This is Captain Ramey. 
          Somebody talk to me.

                    SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
          Yeah.  We took him out, Captain. 
          Nobody else got hurt.

                    RAMEY
          What's his condition?

                    SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
          Critical.  The sonofabitch took
          two.  Probably won't survive the
          ride.

                    RAMEY
          Get a statement from him.  I'll be
          right over.

     He drops the receiver so that it dangles again.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and
     medics.  He's stunned, but very much alive.

                    MEDIC
          Don't try to sit up.

                    STU
          What was that?

                    RAMEY
               (kneeling)
          Rubber bullet.

                    MEDIC
          You'll have one hell of a nasty
          welt.  Busted rib.  Maybe a
          permanent scar there.

                    STU
          It couldn't hurt much more if you
          really shot me.

                    RAMEY
          Somebody was going to and we
          thought it may as well be us.

                    STU
          Did you get him?

                    RAMEY
          Sure as hell did.  Thanks to you.

                    STU
          Still alive?

                    RAMEY
          Barely.

                    MEDIC
          We'll be giving him a hypo for the
          pain.  It'll put him out for a
          while.

     Kelly is now brought over by a female cop.  She drops to her
     knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him.  The medics
     restrain her.

                    STU
          It's okay.  I'm not really shot.

                    KELLY
          I was so afraid.  I thought...

                    STU
          I thought so, too.  But we're going
          to be alright.  Both of us.

                    KELLY
          Remember how you swore up and down
          you'd get me on TV?  Well, you did. 
          I already got interviewed on Fox
          and Channel Eleven and they even
          want me on A.M. America tomorrow
          morning.

                    STU
          Bet you didn't think I could
          deliver on that.

                    MEDIC
          Will you please let go of him,
          Miss?

     A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance.  The medic
     is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.

                    STU
          No.  No hypo.  I want to see him
          first.

     The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart
     him off.  But Stu struggles against them.

                    RAMEY
          Relax.  The guy's dying.

                    STU
          That's why I've gotta talk to him. 
          Please!

                    RAMEY
          We'll see.

                    MEDIC
               (to Kelly)
          You can ride with him in the
          ambulance.

     The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance.

     Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team
     inside the hotel.

                    RAMEY
          This is Ramey.  Over.  This is
          Ramey.  Ten-Four.

     There's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple
     garbled voices on the other end of the line.

                    RAMEY
          Shit.  Get everybody off this
          wavelength.

     He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling
     receiver.

                    RAMEY
          Hello.  Hello!  Pick up!  Yeah,
          it's Ramey again.  Can you hold the
          phone close enough so the perp can
          listen?

                    COP'S VOICE
          He's not saying a word, Captain.

                    RAMEY
          He's not about to talk to us. 
          Maybe to him.

     Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift
     Stu onto the gurney.

                    RAMEY
          Forget that.  Stand him up.
               (to Stu)
          Can you stand?

                    STU
          I can try.

                    RAMEY
          Help him over here.

     The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth.  It's
     painful, but Stu ignores it.

     Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.

                    RAMEY
          Here.  Speak up.

                    STU
               (into pay phone)
          It's me.  Do you hear me?  Answer
          me.

                    VOICE
               (wheezing)
          Had to have the last word, Stu.

                    STU
          I finally beat your ass.  Admit it,
          you fuck.

                    VOICE
          But you'll never forget me.  I gave
          you the most thrilling day of your
          life.  Say thanks.

                    STU
          Now you're gonna die, you bastard.

                    VOICE
          I lost a lot of blood.  Don't you
          want to donate some for me?  Then
          we'd really be part of each other.

                    STU
          Hang on.  I can't wait to see you
          at the hospital.  So I can yank
          your fucking air tube out.

                    VOICE
          Wish I could give you that
          pleasure.  You deserve it.
               (coughing)
          ... Only I'm out of time.

                    STU
          What's your name?  At least tell me
          who you are.

     There's more violent coughing, then silence.  Then a cop's
     voice is heard.

                    COP'S VOICE
          He's gone.

     Stu stares at the receiver.

                    RAMEY
          Don't worry.  We'll find out who he
          is.  And why he picked you.

                    STU
          No.  You won't.
               (a beat)
          What do you want to bet you won't?

     Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver.  CLICK.

                    STU
          I'll spend my whole life trying to
          figure that out.

     Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto
     the waiting gurney.

     The hypo is finally administered.  It kicks in immediately,
     relieving the pain.

     He's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. 
     Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the
     hospital.

     STU'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH

     pulling away in LOW ANGLE.

     CAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu.  The doors
     shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his
     entire world until moments ago.

                    STU
               (groggy)
          Gotta sleep now.  No phone calls...

     Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs.  Stu passes out 
     -- into a deep sleep he much deserves.

     A SIREN BLARES.

     CUT TO BLACK.
