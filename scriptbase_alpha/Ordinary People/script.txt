              Students' choir rehearsing Canon in D by Pachelbel (not
              originally written with lyrics). Among many, Conrad is
              singing. He is just behind Jeannine Pratt. They don't know
              each other yet.

              A man of fifty is holding his wife's hand over the breakfast
              table.
          
                                     MAN
                           Do you know we've made love one
                           hundred and thirteen times?
          
              We hear laughter (numerous).
          
                                     MAN (cont'd)
                           I figured it out on my Bowmar
                           calculator.

              Laughter again. The man and the woman are two actors on stage
              of the local theater. A very conventional play. The set
              represents an average American kitchen. A man and a woman are
              having coffee. Man is holding woman's hand.
          
              We gradually discover the audience of the theater.
          
                                     MAN (cont'd)
                           To know someone that well is a
                           wonderful thing.

              [ close in on two couples in the audience] Beth and Calvin
              and their friends. The women are amused, the men trying to
              keep awake.
          
                                        WOMAN
                           No, one.
          
                                     MAN
                           So I don't know everything about
                           you. I don't know your favorite
                           movie stars. I can't remember the
                           name of your favorite perfume. I
                           have racked my brain and I can't
                           remember.
          
                                     WOMAN
                           That's funny. It's "My Sin."
          
              Audience laughs, Alvin wakes up and behaves. Gives a
              conventional smile to his wife Beth.
          
                                     MAN
                           But I do know, in the last twenty
                           four years, that I have never been
                           out of love with you.

              The four of them come out of the theater. The women walk
              together in front, men behind.

              notices this, then notices the light under his son's bedroom

              Conrad is lying on his stomach, on his bed, thinking. He
              composes himself, grabs his book as if he had been reading.
          
                                     CONRAD

                            That Christmas in London would be
                            like something out of Dickens.
                            We've never done that before,
                            right? Christmas in London?

                            Maybe we shouldn't plan to go away
                            right now.

                            Yeah. I know we talked about it,
                            but the more I talk about it, the
                            more the timing doesn't seem right.

                            we all should. It's important.

                            No. If he doesn't go through with
                            this now, he might change his mind.

                            mind, maybe it's not something that
                            was right for him to do.

                            I've got a meeting over at school.
                            Drama Club meeting. We're doing "A
                            Thousand Clowns" this year. You
                            know it? Anyway. We're going so
                            crazy trying to get it together.
                            I am secretary this year too.

                            I didn't know quite what to
                            expect, though... I mean, you
                            sounded...uh, you sounded sort of

                            a name, and I went for a while. But

                            for me, I guess. He just kept
                            telling me all the things I already
                            knew, and , uh... finally, I

                            help me is myself. At least, that's
                            what my dad says.

                            you, Conrad. I mean I think that
                            if it's something you want to do,
                            that's what you should be doing.

               Beth is laughing at Buck story. She is lying leisurely on a
               mattress on the lawn. Buck is standing, telling his story.
          
                                      BUCK
                            Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started
                            to just scream, just cry, right?
                            It was crazy. We got so drunk
                            that we couldn't talk to each
                            other. It was the last day... the
                            last day of school.
          
               A younger Conrad, sitting aside, is listening too, amused.

                            We walked out of the building in
                            the middle of the class!
          
               Conrad laughs. Beth laughs.
          
                                         BETH
                            Oh, Bucky!
          
               Beth laughs.

               Beth laughs. Conrad stares at Beth laughing on the phone. The
               gossip gets too funny.
          
                                         BETH
                            No. Stop!
          
               Beth laughs.

                            My father came into my room and he
                            didn't know what to say.
                            This is right after Buck died.
                            And he came over and sat on the
                            bed next to me, put his arm
                            around my shoulder. We just sat
                            there.
                            I remember I was watching his
                            shoe.
                            And thinking...
                            Cos his shoe was turned over on
                            its side.
                            I was thinking: "He's so uptight,
                            it's gonna crack off."

                            But I didn't know what to feel.
                            I kept thinking what they say on

                            improvement. She doesn't crack gum

                            gets it in his head he wants to go.
                            Maybe he'll decide to take a tour
                            of Europe for a year and not even
                            go to school at all. Who knows?

                            worrying doesn't amount to a hill
                            of crap. It's just wasted energy.
          
               Calvin is troubled.

               heavily swimming in his lane, although he looks tired and
               bored, not really fit for training. He stops, exhausted at
               the end of a row, looks at his friends happily discussing
               by the side of the pool, then at coach Salan in his office
               glass booth overlooking the swimming pool. Conrad reflects.

               Jeannine stops to drink some water at the tap of the
               fountain. Conrad see her when he is already too near, and
               has almost his coat on. Seeing an opportunity to talk to
               her, he steps back, takes off his coat while she is not
               looking, then passes her, putting on his coat as if he was
               naturally on his way out.

                            call it a real date. We could fake
                            it sort of, to see how it goes..

                            Beth. Let's not fight. Okay? No
                            fighting. Okay? Please. Let's go
                            upstairs.
          
               Calvin goes, but Beth doesn't, and turns away.

               Calvin enters Conrad's bedroom and closes the door. Conrad is
               lying on his stomach, feeling all crooked. His voice is
               muffled by his head between his arms.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            I want to talk to you.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            I need to sleep.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            In a minute...
          
                                      CONRAD
                            I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any
                            of it. I am sorry. Please don't be
                            mad.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to
                            figure out what happened down
                            there.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            I don't know what happened! I am
                            sorry about it all. I am sorry
                            about the whole thing. What I
                            said, I didn't mean it. Just please
                            tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will
                            you?
          
                                      CALVIN

                            Oh, God, no, I can't! Don't you
                            see? I can't talk to her!

                            Ha! Because it doesn't change
                            anything. It doesn't change the way
                            she looks at me.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            She was upset, Conrad. Your mother
                            was hurt because you quit the swim
                            team. I don't understand it myself.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            I don't mean just now. Don't you
                            see? I don't mean just today.
          
                                      CALVIN
                            What then? Explain it to me.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            Ha! I can't! Everything is German
                            pudding with you , dad. You don't
                            see things!

                            What things?
          
               Conrad sighs.
          
                                      CALVIN (cont'd)
                            What things? Please, I want you to
                            tell me.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            That she hates me! Can't you see
                            that?

                            All right, all right. You're right.
                            She doesn't. Please leave me alone,
                            now.
          
               Silence. Then Calvin stands up and goes to the door.

                            What about this Dr. Berger? Do you
                            think he's helping you?

                            Tuesday you felt great. You bought
                            a Christmas tree, it was all hunky-
                            dory. Okay?
          
                                      CONRAD
                            You're the doctor.

                            Don't take refuge in one-liners
                            like "You're the doctor". Okay?
                            Because that pisses me off.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            Okay. Okay.
          
                                      DR BERGER
                            So everything was fine till you had
                            the fight with your mother, then
                            everything was lousy.
          
                                      CONRAD
                            Yeah, but I don't blame her. I
                            mean, she's got... She's got her
                            reasons. It's impossible after all

                            here. Now, what shit?

                            And don't give me "I tried to
                            kill myself", that's old turkey.

                            in her towels, in her rug.
                            Everything had to be pitched.
                            Even the tiles in the bathroom
                            had to be regrouted. Christ, she
                            fired the godamn maid because she
                            couldn't dust the living room
                            right. If you think I'm gonna

                            forgive me...
          
               Conrad stops. Dr. Berger looks at Conrad to signal him he
               just said something: Conrad realizes he just made a Freudian
               slip, looks at him,

                            Ha! Now we're back to the rotten
                            kid routine! She can't love you
                            because you're unlovable. Where
                            does that leave your dad? How come
                            he loves you? You're a rottenkid,
                            doesn't he know that?

                            That's different. He feels
                            responsible. Besides, he loves
                            everybody.

                            taste! He loves you, but he's
                            wrong.
                            Look... maybe she just can't
                            express it the way you'd like her
                            to. Maybe she's just afraid to
                            show you what she feels.

                            Say. After going to a new high, it
                            falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies
                            on good volume. I shoot an order to
                            buy 4000 at the market. If I get
                            the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know
                            something's wrong.

                            4000 shares I put in at the price
                            of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500
                            at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way
                            up, so the last 500 shares I pay
                            115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm
                            going to peel off here.

                            psychiatry's about. Being precise
                            and clear. And honest, of course.
                            I'll level with you. I'm not a
                            great believer in psychiatry.

                            that. I am not trying to put you
                            down, I just don't believe in
                            psychiatry as a panacea for
                            everybody.

                            Conrad. You see, I knew something
                            was wrong even before he tried
                            to... to kill himself. But I
                            thought that... It's clear that
                            he's very smart. He's been an "A"
                            student ever since he started
                            school, and naturally I thought
                            that ...intelligent people could
                            work out their own problems.

                            It was luck. It was just luck
                            that I happened to be there when
                            he tried it. I could have been at
                            a meeting. We both could've been
                            away. It was luck!

                            You think of yourself as a lucky
                            man, then?
          
                                      CALVIN
                            No! No. No. I used to. I used to
                            think... that I was a lucky person...
                            before... the "accident".
                            Mmm, I guess the whole of life is
                            nothing but an accident, is it?
                            What happens to you. I should do
                            with it.

                            That sounds more like the
                            philosophy of a drifter than a tax
                            attorney.

                            Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a
                            little. I can see myself, ...and I
                            can see the two of them drifting
                            away from me, and I just stand
                            there watching.

                            about it. I don't know what.

                            I feel like I'm sitting on a fence,

                            Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too
                            much like her. People always think
                            that she and Buck are... were
                            ...were alike. But it's really she
                            and Conrad. They were the only two
                            that didn't cry at the funeral, you
                            know? It's not easy for me to admit
                            this but, uh... she didn't...
                            His mother doesn't show him a
                            great deal of affection. I'm not
                            trying to put her down in any way
                            at all. She is a wonderful woman,

                            she felt for him was special. You
                            know, he was her first-born.

                            been... We've been married nearly
                            twenty one years. Everybody loves

                            it's been difficult. He didn't talk
                            about that? We don't know what
                            happens here. It doesn't come up. I

               Beth and Conrad are having lunch at a table in the diner.
               Beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought.

                            something for my mother and father.
                            He's not supposed to get
                            something for his doctor, is he?

                            Wouldn't it be easier if we all

                            Hoo, that's pretty funny. Hey,

                            look silly.

               Jeannine enters frame looking very focused, ball in hand.
               Conrad looks. She shoots but the ball drops and goes into
               the gutter to the end. Conrad does not react. The skittles
               are intact.

                            it's not really scary, except it
                            is when you think back on it.

               The manager tries to calm them down. A student comes to

               Golf ball being wished out of sight by a club. Beth, Calvin,
               Ward (Beth's brother) and his wife Audrey, are having drinks
               sitting at a table on a golf course under a parasol.
          
               WARD lifts his golf club and demonstrates a clumsy hesitating
               swing, and how it misses.

               Revolver fires upwards. Swimmers dive. It's a swimming

               fully dressed, uneasy, while down there, by the side of the
               pool, his friends, in swimming trunks and wet hair, watch the
               race. Lazenby sees him, Conrad looks down. In the audience,
               everyone is shouting for his team.

               and silent, except for someone sweeping the side of the pool,
               and Conrad sitting still, reflecting, looking around.

                          Feelings are scary. And sometimes
                          they're painful. And if you can't
                          feel pain, then you're not gonna
                          feel anything else either. You know
                          what I'm saying?

                          You're here and you're alive. And
                          don't tell me you don't feel that.

                          It doesn't feel good.
          
                                    DR BERGER
                          It is good. Believe me.

                Jeannine opens her curtains, sees Conrad, outside her home,
                walking to and fro. She puts on a jacket and comes out to
                him.

                             Hi. I was gonna call but I didn't
                             want to wake anyone.
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Might have been easier...
          
                                       CONRAD
                             Listen, I want to say something
                             about the other night. I mean I
                             liked being with you but I didn't
                             like myself.
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Conrad. I was stupid.
                             That was dumb of me to laugh and
                             it was my fault. I just didn't
                             know what to do. I was
                             embarrassed.
          
                                        CONRAD
                             Really?   You were embarrassed?
          
                                       JEANNINE
                             Yes. When those boys came in, it
                             was awful and awkward. That's what
                             I do when I get embarrassed. I
                             laugh.
          
                                       CONRAD
                             But they were all right. They were
                             just up and they were having a good
                             time, and I let them get in the way
                             of what was happening. It was dumb.
                             It was dumb. I've been doing lots
                             of dumb things lately. I just
                             didn't know wether or not you were
                             being straight with me.

                             Anyway, I'd like to try it again. I
                             thought it worked out okay. Well,
                             except for the bowling.
          
                Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his
                eyes.

                Conrad realizes. Laughs.

                             I don't know. Maybe you can't
                             love anybody. It was so much
                             Buck. And Buck died, it was as if
                             you buried all your love with
                             him, and I don't understand that.
                             I just don't know.
          
                Calvin sighs.

                             Maybe it wasn't even Buck.
                             Maybe it was just you.
                             Maybe, finally, it was the best
                             of you that you buried.

                Beth enters, kind of reflects, then goes open a closet, takes
                out some luggage. A sudden burst of emotion overcomes her,
                she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then
                restrains it.

                In his bed Conrad is not sleeping. He hears the door of the
                house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel. He
                gets up, go look out of the window. Ouside, a taxi leaves. He
                goes downstairs.

                From inside, Conrad finally sees his father in the garden,
                reflecting. Patches of snow. Conrad puts on his coat over
                his pyjamas, and joins him.
