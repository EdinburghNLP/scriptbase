                              FADE IN:
CITY OF ANGELS
lies spread out beneath us in all its  splendor,  like  a
bargain basement Promised Land. CAMERA SOARS, DIPS, WINDS
its way SLOWLY  DOWN,  DOWN, bringing us IN OVER the city
as we:
SUPER MAIN TITLES.
TITLES END, as we --
SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD a lush, high-rise apartment complex. The
moon reflected in glass.
CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH billowing curtains,
INTO the inner sanctum of a penthouse apartment, and here,
boys and girls, is where we lose our breath, because --
spread-eagled on a sumptuous designer sofa lies the single
most beautiful GIRL in the city. Blonde hair. A satin
nightgown that positively  glows. Sam Cooke MUSIC, crooning
from five hundred dollar SPEAKERS.
PASTEL colors. Window  walls. New wave furniture tor- tured
into weird shapes. It looks like robots live here. On the
table next to the sleeping Venus lies an open bottle of
pills ... next to that, a mirror dusted with cocaine. She
rouses herself to smear some powder on her  gums. As she
does, we see from her eyes that she is thoroughly,
completely whacked out of her mind... She stands, stumbles
across the room, pausing to glance at a photograph on the
wall: Two men. Soldiers. Young, rough-hewn, arms around
each other. The Girl throws open the glass doors ... steps
out onto a balcony, and there, beneath her, lies  all of
nighttime L.A. Panoramic splendor. Her hair flies, her
expression. rapt, as she stands against this sea of
technology. She is beautiful. On the balcony railing beside
her  stand three potted plants. The Girl sees them, picks
one up. Looks over the balcony railing ... It is ten
stories down to the parking lot. she squints, holds the
plant over the edge.
               GIRL
     Red car.
Drops the plant. Down it goes, spiralling end over end --
until, finally ... BAM --  ! SHATTERS. Dirt flies. A red
Chevy is now minus a WINDSHIELD. The Girl takes another
plant.
               GIRL
     Green car.
She drops it. Green Dodge. Ten stories below, BAM Impact
city. Scratch one paint job. Grabs the final plant and
holds it out, saying:
               GIRL
     Blue car.
POW. GLASS SHATTERS.  Dirt sprays. A blue BMW this time.
The Girl loves this game ... her expression is slightly
crazed.  She reaches for another plant -- There aren.t any.
Her smile fades -- And for a moment, just a moment, the
dullness leaves her eyes and she is suddenly, incredibly
sober. And tears fill her eyes as she looks over the edge --
               GIRL
     Yellow car.
And jumps the railing. Plummets, head over heels like  a
rag doll. Hits the yellow car spot on. She lies, dead, like
an extinguished dream. Still beautiful.
                               CUT TO:
EXT. BENEATH THE PIER    NIGHT
FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS are camped out under  the
pier, warming themselves around a small bonfire, laughing
loudly. Christmas decorations dangle above them from the
pier, and empty beer cans litter the sand around them.
CAMERA PUSHES IN to discover an old collie tied to one of
the pilings. Then we realize that the dog is being tor-
mented by the dock workers. They flick lighted matches at
him. Shake their beers and spray him in the face. These
guys are not rocket scientists. The dog cowers, tugging bn
the rope.  Tries to get away. All to the great amusement of
its tormentors. One of them turns, laughing -- As a shadowy
FIGURE strides calmly up to the fire: Long hair. Cigarette
dangling from-lower lip. Shirt-tails hanging loose below
the waist. Nothing threatening in his manner as he plops
down  beside the men, smiling. They are immediately on
their guard.
               RIGGS (FIGURE)
     Happy holidays.  Mind if I join you?
               PUNK  #1
     Yes.
               PUNK  #2
     Fuck off.
Riggs smiles at him innocently. Strokes the collie’s fur
with one hand.
With the other, he reaches intb a paper sack and produces,
a spanking new bottle of Jack Daniels, possibly the finest
drink mankind has yet produced.
               RIGGS
     I need help drinking this. Cool?
The dock workers exchange glances. There seems to be no
harm in this. One of them frowns:
               PUNK  #1
     You a homo?
               RIGGS
     Do I look like a homo?
               PUNK  #1
     You got long hair.  Homos got long
     hair.
               PUNK #3
     I hate homos.  Arrggh.
Riggs shakes his head, laughs.
               RIGGS
     Boy, you guys are terrific.  You make
     me laugh, you just do.
At which point, appropriately enough, Punk #4 shakes a beer
and sprays it in the old collie’s face. The DOG pulls away,
WHINING. Riggs leans forward.
               RIGGS
     This your dog?  Nice dog.
And then, he proceeds to do a peculiar thing: He starts to
talk to the dog -- in what seems to be the dog’s own
language. Very weird, folks... He coos, snuffles, barks
softly, then withdraws, listening, his ear to the dog’s
muzzle. Riggs nods. Frowns. The others look  on,  puzzled.
Then Riggs looks at each of the four dock workers.
               RIGGS
     Huh-  You know what?  He says he
     doesn.t want you to spray beer in his
     face.  He says he just hates that.
A pause.  Uncomfortable.  Then --
               PUNK #1
     Oh, he does ... ?
          (beat)
     Well, mister, why don.t you ask him
     what he likes...?
The others snicker. Riggs simply nods.
               RIGGS
     Okay.
And once again, begins to confer with the dog.  Listens
intently, piecing together what he is hearing.
               RIGGS
     What ... ? You want ...  oh.  Oh, hell
     no, I couldn.t do  that  ... Nossirree
     bob,  you  little  nut.
He ruffles the dog’s hair. The men are more puzzled than
ever as Riggs turns and says:
               RIGGS
          (chuckling)
     Get this: He wants  me  to  beat the
     shit out of you guys.
Everything stops. A cloud passes over the assembled faces
and a pin-dropping silence ensues. Riggs, completely
heedless, once again attends to the dog:
               RIGGS
     What’s that ... ?  The one ... in the
     middle...  .is a stupid fat duck....
     What ... ?
          (listens again)
     Oh ... Oh!  A ’stupid fat fuck!. Right.
He looks up, shakes his head.
               RIGGS
     Boy, this dog is pissed.
The one in the middle grabs Riggs by the collar. Hoists him
to his feet. Gulp. Stands, staring down at Riggs, whose
eyes are completely neutral, like a snake’s.
               PUNK #1
     Buddy, you.re shortening your life
     span.
He flicks open a mean-looking switchblade. Riggs is dead
meat. So why then, does he choose this moment to execute a
Three Stooges. routine, consisting of nose tweak, eye
gouge, and rotating fist that bobs the dock worker on the
head... ? He’s nuts or something ... Riggs steps back and
adopts a neutral fighting stance.
The others begin to circle. The DOG BARKS. Riggs turns to
the dog, but his eyes never leave his grinning attackers.
               RIGGS
          (to the collie)
     What’s that ... ? You want me to take
     the knife away... and break his
     elbow... ?
Circling ... Riggs, watching them, his eyes beginning to
dance ... Breathing slow and even...
               RIGGS
     But that would be excruciatingly
     painful ...
Something inside Riggs is gearing up ... the others can
perhaps sense it, their smiles falter a bit, they  crouch,
combat-ready... Riggs, eyes blazing ...
               RIGGS
     And if I separated the fat one’s
     shoulder... he.d probably scream... No
     doubt about it.
We know from the look in Riggs. eyes he’s nuts. He wants
the fight, badly, all four of them at once ...
And then Punk #1 springs... Big mistake. Needless to say,
mincemeat is made of the  four  meddlesome dog-torturers.
The beach is littered with their writhing forms as Riggs
does, finally, what he set out to do: Unties the dog.
Starts to go. As he does, he pats his shirt ... Pats his
jeans ... Realizes his wallet has flown free during the
fracas. Scoops to retrieve it from its resting place on the
sand, where it lies open, and as it lies open, yes,  folks,
that is a badge we see. Riggs, we realize, is an officer of
the law. He lights a cigarette and notices the collie,
seated. Frowns:
               RIGGS
     Okay, skeezix.  Go on.  Get outta here.
He begins to walk away. The dog remains close at his heels.
Following him.
               RIGGS
     No, no. Don.t follow me. I.m an
     asshole. Go away.
The dog sits obediently and Riggs walks away. He can.t help
it, looks back over his shoulder... Sees the dog watching
him with a beseeching expression. Pitiful.
               RIGGS
     Aw, shit.
He signals the dog.
               RIGGS
     Awright.  Move it.  Let’s go.
The COLLIE BARKS happily and dashes toward him through the
surf, kicking up sand and water. As they shuffle off
against the palm-lined skyline, we hear, supered, Riggs.
voice.
               RIGGS (V.O.)
     So.  You live in the area?  What’s your
     major ... ?
And so on as we ...
                               CUT TO:
EXT. MURTAUGH’s HOUSE - PRE-DAWN
Palm trees cast shadows on the lawn. Toys, lots of them,
littered across the lawn. A Big Wheel, a G.I. Joe figure.
Christmas lights are strung across the eaves.
                               CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM     SAME
A real gun, a .38  Police Special, dangling in its hol-
ster from the back of a chair. Next to it -- A real badge,
gleaming in the light. It identifies its owner as LAPD
Robbery/Homicide.
ANOTHER ANGLE
A birthday cake comes INTO FRAME. A set of matronly hands
places it directly in front of --
DETECTIVE ROGER  MURTAUGH
Seated in the bathtub. He groans, throws a towel over
himself, and mutters in mock indignation: Roger is tough:
An old-fashioned fighter, wears his past like a scar.
Piercing eyes; cynical. He is surrounded by his family;
wife and three children, names and ages as follows:  TRISH:
Roughly thirty-eight. She used to be a stunner.  NICK: Ten
years old. Precocious. CARRIE: Age seven. Eyes  like
saucers. Adorable. RIANNE: Heartbreaker stuff, Seventeen.
Takes your breath away folks. The cake is a real beauty.
               CARRIE
     Make a wish, Daddy.
               RIANNE
     Go for it, Dad.
               MURTAUGH
          (smiles)
     Go for it, huh...?  Okay, I.ll go for
     it.
He blows out the candles. Applause. His gaze lingers on --
the cake. Or rather, the message scrawled atop it in icing:
WELCOME TO THE BIG 50 The presents arrive.
                              CUT  TO:
EXT. SIMI VALLEY - MORNING
The scorched landscape stretches out beneath a lattice-
work of high-tension power lines. Only scrub grass grows
here. Rusted railroad tracks wander into the distance, and
nestled beside them, like the last stop before death --
sits a lonely trailer home. Battered TV antenna. A dirt
yard which houses a beat-up pickup truck. Dead garden
sprouting weeds. The ground begins to tremble ... like an
earthquake, RATTLING the POWER POLES, as, without warning --
An express TRAIN BLASTS BY CAMEPA and streaks past the
trailer at seventy miles an hour.
INT. TRAILER HOME
Now we are inside, the RUMBLING FAINTER ... And we are
looking at a tired, chiseled face. Etched with line and
shadow. Eyes closed, as the shadows from the speeding train
strobe across DETECTIVE SERGEANT MARTIN RIGGS. Morning is
not a good time for Riggs. The CLOCK RADIO suddenly BLARES
to life: ’silver Belllls ... It’s Christmas Tiiime in the
City.... Riggs snaps awake instantly. Alert. Tense. Face
bathed in sweat.
ANOTHER ANGLE
He is not alone. In the doorway sits a thoroughly loveable
black Labrador. Sitting stock still.  Staring at Riggs,
watching him sleep. Tail going thump-thump-thump on the
carpet. Riggs sits up. Stares at the dog.
               RIGGS
     Sam, today is the first day ... of the
     rest of my life.
He lights a cigarette. Inhales. Coughs and hacks.
The TRAIN THROBS by outside, rattling his skull ...
                               CUT TO:
INT. MURTAUGH HOME - SAME TIME
And it is a typical morning for Detective Roger Murtaugh.
Chaos. The TELEVISION BLARES. Young Carrie Murtaugh wails
like a banshee. Her brother Nick tells her to shut up.
Trish Murtaugh is burning eggs in the kitchen. Roger
Murtaugh enters then, fixing his tie. The following
dialogue is fast and furious, tossed over the shoulder as
Murtaugh scurries to and fro, getting dressed:
               MURTAUGH
     Honey, what’s this on my tie?
She looks.
               TRISH
     An  ugly spot?
               MURTAUGH
     Thanks. Sharp as a pin.
               TRISH
     I.m thinking of going on .Jeopardy..
               MURTAUGH
     Don.t take any questions on cooking.
               TRISH
     Thanks.  I love you, too.
Carrie is still shrieking. Tears stream down her face.
               MURTAUGH
     Hey, kid, turn off the waterworks,
     okay?
               CARRIE
          (points to Nick)
     Daddy, he changed the channel!
               MURTAUGH
     NOOOOOO.
               NICK
     She’s a crybaby, Dad.
               MURTAUGH
     Mind your own busines.
          (nods toward the TV)
     That’s illegal.
               NICK
     What’s illegal?
               MURTAUGH
     Can.t put a dead body in an ambulance.
     This .Kojak.?
               NICK
     ’starsky and  Hutch..
               MURTAUGH
     Huh.  It’s illegal.  Never put a dead
     body in an ambulance, son, you got
     that?
               NICK
     Sure, Dad.
               MURTAUGH
     Honey, where’s the spot remover?
          (turns to Carrie)
     Young lady, stop crying or I.ll give
     you something to cry about. Damn.
He dabs at his tie. Carrie screams. In the kitchen Trish
drops the eggs, swears. The PHONE RINGS. Carrie screams.
               MURTAUGH
     That’s it. I.m gonna give you something
     to cry about. He grabs a copy of
     Newsweek and hands it to her.
               MURTAUGH
     Starving children. See? They haven.t
     eaten, it’s very sad. Cry.
He moves away.
               CARRIE
     Daddy, you.re weird ...
               MURTAUGH
     Thank you, Carrie.  Hear that, honey,
     the children think I.m weird.
               TRISH
     They.re bright children.
          (hangs up the) telephone)
     Honey, you know a man named Dick Lloyd?
     Don.t step in the egg.
               MURTAUGH
     Where’s my thinking? I should.ve
     checked the floor for egg. Dick Lloyd
     ... ?
          (beat)
     Jesus, Dick Lloyd.  What’s he want?
               TRISH
     The office called. He’s been trying to
     reach you for three days now.
               MURTAUGH
     I haven.t talked to him in... shit,
     twelve years?  No, wait a minute, that
     would make me fifty years old, that
     can.t be right.
               TRISH
          (smiles)
     You.re not getting older, you.re
     getting better.
               MURTAUGH
     Inform the children of this.
          (kisses her; heads for the
           door)
     Forget the eggs, I.ll eat later.
               TRISH
     Whatever.
          (beat)
     Honey?
          (as he stops)
     How come I never heard of Dick Lloyd?
               MURTAUGH
     I never talked about him.
               TRISH
     Oh.
          (beat)
     Vietnam buddy?
               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.  Vietnam buddy.
He exits the kitchen, crosses the entrance hall. Stops,
noticing Rickles the cat, who is happily munching on the
remains of Roger’s birthday cake.
               MURTAUGH
     Hey.
He swats it aside. Pauses, his gaze lingering on the silent
message which gnaws at his guts.
THE BIG 50 ...
He comes out the front door. Flicks off the Christmas
lights, crosses to the car. Looks up, and  sees  --  his
oldest daughter Rianne. Jogging past. She wears an adorable
pair of dolphin shorts. Walkman headphones. She waves.
               RIANNE
     .Bye, Daddy.
He waves.
               MURTAUGH
          (shakes his head)
     Goddamn heartbreaker.  She’s a
     heartbreaker.

SERIES OF SHOTS - RIGGS  GETTING DRESSED
Riggs enters the living room, naked. Scars on his back, the
kind you get from knives. Runs a hand  through  limp hair.
Turns on the lamp. As he does  --  the TELEVISION also
springs to life; hooked to the same circuit. Pops three
aspirin from a bottle. Chews them. Opens a bag of peanuts,
throws it to the big Lab, who gobbles them down. Eats a
sandwich, standing in the middle of his apartment. .Looking
at the floor. What a lonely fucking guy ... Straps on his
gun. .9 millimeter Beretta, if it matters. Throws on a
jacket. Downs a shot of whiskey. Pauses, looking at a
photograph on the wall. Riggs, much younger, along with a
pretty and vivacious woman in a wedding gown: his wife.
Stares at the photograph.  His fingers twirl the whiskey
glass with completely unconscious skill. Tense. Tense ...
twirling the glass ... RICHARD DAWSON DRONES from the TV
(our survey says -- !). Riggs slings the shotglass. Dead
center, SHATTERING the TV SCREEN.
                               CUT TO:
INT. POLICE FIRING PANGE - MORNING
Targets: Human silhouettes with kill zones numbered.
Murtaugh enters. Sheds his coat, unholsters the .38. Steps
to the red line. Shifts. Stretches. Cracks his neck. This
is a ritual for him.
He stops to examine his right hand, holding it steady
before his eyes. Except there is a slight tremble. Tiny,
but  it’s  there.  He frowns. Braces himself: Cross-draws
with lightning swiftness. -- BAM! -- The sound is DEAFENING
in the closed room. A neat round hole appears in the
target. Perfect shot: a neat third eye. Murtaugh smiles.
Holsters his gun. Puts on his coat -- and sings softly to
himself:
               MURTAUGH
     Happy birthday to me ...
                               CUT TO:
INT. CAR - DAY
Sergeant Martin Riggs is driving. He looks like he hasn.t
slept. He certainly hasn.t shaved. The DISPATCH RADIO
SQUAWKS. He turns down the MUSIC from the car radio and
hears:
               DISPATCHER  (V.0.)
     All units in the vicinity and Fourteen
     X-ray thirty-one, shooting in progress
     at Venice Beach, Washington and Navy.
     Three victims down, PA en route
     Fourteen X-ray thirty-one, handle code
     three.
Riggs hits the gas pedal and PEELS OUT.
                               CUT TO:
EXT. CENTURY CITY PARKING LOT  -  MORNING
The sky threatens rain. Cars buzz by as the city awakens. A
section of the parking lot is cordoned off by yellow
streamers which read: POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS, and as we
watch, a black and white patrol car pulls up, admitting two
beat COPS and a young hooker. Her name is DIXIE, and she is
not happy.
               DIXIE
     Can I stay in the car?
               COP #1
     No.
               DIXIE
     Aw, cut me a break.  I  told  you
     already: she came  out  on  the balcony
     --
               COP #1
          (points)
     That balcony ... ?
               DIXIE
     -- No, the Chandler fucking Pavillion,
     of course that fucking balcony, and
     then she jumped, and then I puked in a
     trash can. Can I go now?
               COP #1
     Not .til you talk to the Sarge.
               DIXIE
     Terrific.  Where the hell is he?
INT. MURTAUGH’s CAR
The sarge drives up and gets out. A BEAT COP Toes by.
               BEAT COP
     Happy 50th, Rog.
               MURTAUGH
     Fuck you.
He crosses to the two Cops and Dixie.
               COP #2
     Hey,  Sarge.
               MURTAUGH
     .Morning, Phil. Get some rain, looks
     like.
          (beat)
     Hey, Dixie. Nice threads.
               DIXIE
     Hey, Murtaugh. Tell these bozos to lay
     Off.
               MURTAUGH
     You. Bozos. Lay off.
               COP #1
     Had a jumper last night, Sarge. Dixie
     here was walking by, saw the whole
     thing.
               MURTAUGH
     You got a statement?  Send her home.
               DIXIE
     Thanks, Rog. I.m beat, you know how it
     is.
               MURTAUGH
     Sure.
          (points to her outfit)
     All dressed up and no one to blow.
               DIXIE
     You.re hilarious.
She exits. Cop #2 escorts Murtaugh across the parking lot.
               COP #2
     Nice wholesome girl. She got a new job,
     you know.
               MURTAUGH
     What’s that?
               COP #2
     County ceiling inspector.
          (beat)
     So. Fifty years old, huh?
               MURTAUGH
     Eat me.
They stop next to the Porsche. Murtaugh grimaces.
               COP #2
     Name is Amanda Lloyd, age twenty-two,
     prostitute, one arrest, no convictions.
     Born Tennessee, parents --
               MURTAUGH
     What was the name?
               COP #2.
     Lloyd. Amanda Lloyd. You know her...?
Murtaugh looks stunned.  He speaks very slowly:
               MURTAUGH
     I knew her dad.
               COP #2
     Jesus.
          (an awkward pause)
     Vehicle is registered to her. She
     landed right on top of her own car.
               MURTAUGH
     Find out who bought it for her. Her
     sugar daddy.
               COP #2
     Take some looking into.
               MURTAUGH
     So look.

INT. AMANDA LLOYD’s APARTMENT - DAY
Murtaugh stares at the photograph we saw earlier. The two
soldiers. One, we can assume, is Dick Lloyd. The other is
Murtaugh. Younger, trimmer. He speaks into the phone.
               MURTAUGH
     Hello, honey ... ? Give me the number
     for Dick Lloyd. What ... ? Yes, the man
     who called me this morning. His
     daughter just took a dive out a window.
EXT. CHRISTMAS TREE LOT  -  DAY
Martin Riggs and three lot employees are gathered around
the liftgate of a truck bearing a load of Christmas trees.
The truck shields them from the view of customers picking
out trees in the lot. The lot employees are actually DRUG
DEALERS. They look around nervously in all directions as
Riggs tastes a sample of their wares.
               RIGGS
     Good stuff.
               DRUG DEALER ONE
     You better fuckin. believe it.
               RIGGS
     Okay. Let’s do it. How much?
               DRUG DEALER TWO
     How much for how much?
               RIGGS
     For all of it.
               DRUG DEALER THREE
     You want it all?
               RIGGS
     Yeah.
          (glances at the trees)
     And maybe a nice big six-footer to put
     it under.
               DRUG DEALER ONE
     The tree you can have for nuthin.. But
     the shit is gonna run you a hundred.
Riggs lets out a soft whistle at the amount.
               RIGGS
     That much, huh?
          (digs into his pocket)
     Okay.  Let’s see what I got.
He pulls out a roll of money and begins to count it out in
twenties and small bills.
               RIGGS
     Twenty, forty, sixty --
The Drug Dealers exchange dumbfounded expressions.
               DRUG DEALER ONE
     Hey, man. Hey!
               RIGGS
     Wait, wait ... shutup. I.m losin
     count.  Where was I?  Oh, yeah...
          (continues to peel off the
           bills)
     ... Eight, ninety, ninety-five, ninety-
     six, ninety-seven...
          (digs into his pocket for loose
           change)
     ... Ninety-seven-fifty. Sixty. Seventy-
     five. Okay, there’s ninety-eight
     dollars and twenty cents...
He is about to check his other pocket for change when Drug
Dealer One stops him.
               DRUG DEALER ONE
     Forget it, dumbshit.
               RIGGS
     C.mon. I.m almost there. Gimme a minute
     to  --
               DRUG DEALER ONE
     One hundred thousand, you stupid fuck!
     One hundred thousand!
Riggs is floored. He can.t believe his ears.
               RIGGS
     Oh, Jesus ... I can.t afford that. Not
     on my salary.
          (beat)
     Look... let’s do this instead ...
          (pulls out his wallet)
     I take your complete stash, okay? I
     take it all. For free. And you assholes
     go to jail.
As he says this, he flips open his wallet and shows his
badge. The Drug Dealers at first look startled, then
disbelieving.
               RIGGS
     I could read you  your  rights, but ...
     nah. You guys know what your rights
     are.
               DRUG DEALER  ONE
     Fuck you, man.  That badge ain.t real.
     And you ain.t real.
               DRUG DEALER TWO
     But you.re sure as hell one crazy fuck!
Riggs. eyes begin to blaze. His nostrils flare. Like a
maniac, he lunges at Drug Dealer  Two.
               RIGGS
     You callin. me crazy!? You think I.m
     crazy! You, wanna see crazy? I.ll show
     you crazy! This is crazy!
Riggs then proceeds to slap and pummel the Drug Dealer in
the manner of the .Three Stooges.... complete with .WOO-
WOO. sound  effects. But he ends the routine by pulling a
nine-millimeter Baretta from behind his back and pressing
it against the neck of Drug Dealer Two.
               RIGGS
     That’s a real badge.  I.m a real cop.
     And this is  a  real  gun.
          (to the other two Drug Dealers)
     Face down on the ground.  Arms and legs
     out.  Do it now!
Dealer One and Three begin to follow orders but Riggs sees
a flicker in their eyes that him to trouble. He spins
around -- a FOURTH DRUG DEALER is behind him with a
shotgun. The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. Riggs ducks, allowing Drug
Dealer Two to take the full force of the .blast in the
face. Riggs rolls in the sawdust
FIRING his BERETTA. Dealer Four takes a bullet between the
eyes. Dealer Two now has an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in his hand. It
CHATTERS in Riggs. direction. Sawdust and pine needles fly
in the air -- but Riggs is able to blow him away.
One more Drug Dealer left.  Riggs can.t find him. His eyes
dart in all directions. Where is he?! Behind Riggs, that’s
where! He presses a revolver to the back of Riggs. head,
taking Riggs. Baretta from him and tucking it into his
belt. Thats when:


FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS

come running from their stakeout positions around the lot.
But they stop short when they see that Riggs is being held
with a gun pointed to his head. The Drug Dealer begins to
move with Riggs toward a van parked nearby.

               RIGGS
          (to officers)
     Shoot him! Shoot him!

               DRUG DEALER
          (to Riggs)
     Shut up!

               RIGGS
          (to Drug Dealer)
     Fuck you!
          (to officers)
     Shoot him! Shoot him!

The narcotics officers don’t know what to do. They are
frustrated. Helpless. Immobilized. Riggs sees the van
looming up. The van means defeat. The van means disgrace.
The van means victory for the bad guys, and we know that
Riggs would rather die than be the instrument of the
Dealer’s escape.

CLOSE ON RIGGS AND DRUG DEALER

The veins are popping out in Riggs’ neck. The Drug Dealer
is getting nervous and panicky. His gun hand is trembling.
The barrel of the gun jiggles against the back of Riggs’
head.

               RIGGS
          (to Drug Dealer)
     Do it, asshole. Pull the trigger. Pull
     the trigger.

               DRUG DEALER
     Shut the fuck up!

They move closer to the van. The narcotics officers have
their guns poised for action, but don’t dare use them.

               DRUG DEALER
          (to officers)
     Guns down! Guns down!

               RIGGS
          (to officers)
     Shoot him!  Kill him!
          (to Dealer)
     Pull the trigger!
          (to officers)
     Waste him!
          (to Dealer)
     Shoot me!
          (to officers)
     Kill him!!

The Dealer is so freaked now that his grip on Riggs slips
momentarily -- and Riggs sees his opening. He spins.  Kicks
the Dealer in the groin. Dislocates his arm -- sending the
gun flying. Riggs retrieves his Baretta from the Dealer’s
belt and shoves the barrel into the Dealer’s face. Riggs’
entire body quakes with  rage. His finger begins to squeeze
back on the trigger. He wants to kill the guy so bad he can
taste it... and yet, he doesn’t do it. The other officers
arrive and step between Riggs and the Dealer. Riggs turns
away. Breatliing hard. Adrenalin pumping. He tucks the
Baretta into his belt, then notices that his hand is
covered with the spilled blood of one of the Drug Dealers.
It gives Riggs  pause.  For a moment, he just looks at it.
HOLD ON Riggs.  VERY CLOSE.  And the look in his eyes.

INT. METRO SQUAD ROOM - MORNING

Police have seldom looked this busy. Yes, there are RINGING
PHONES. Yes, there are CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS. Yes, it
looks like a circus. And here comes Captain of Detectives
ED MURPHY, moving like an after-breakfast juggernaut.
Behind him, a young woman rushes to keep up. The POLICE
PSYCHOLOGIST, no less.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     I want Martin Riggs pulled from duty.

               MURPHY
     Um... no.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     No.  No???  Captain, he walked into the
     line of fire.

               MURPHY
     Very brave individual, don’t you
     think... ?

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     This is utter bullshit.

               MURPHY
     Oh, is it? Forgive me.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Martin Riggs is a cop with a death
     wish.

Murphy shoots her an incredulous look.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     You can quote me. It happens to be my
     professional opinion.

               MURPHY
     Um... good opinion. See you tomorrow.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Captain...

               MURPHY
     Look, Doc, you’re  way  off.  Way off.
     Know what I think? I think Riggs is
     pulling for a psycho pension.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Oh, do you?

               MURPHY
     Yeah.  I am sure you’re aware the
     department offers a disability stress
     pension --

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Yes, I’m aware --

               MURPHY
     -- Except we don’t offer  it  to
     everybody, only cops who seem to suffer
     from

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     -- From abnormal stress,  yes,  I know.
     Or suicidal tendencies.

               MURPHY
     Give the lady a cigar.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     You think Riggs is playing a game?

               MURPHY
     Sure. He wants the cash. Seen it a
     hundred times. He’ll come around.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Sir, with all due respect ... I think
     that’s a dangerous attitude to take.
     May I remind  you  that his wife of
     eleven years was recently killed in a
     car accident, and

               MURPHY
     I know all about Riggs, Doc. He’s a
     tough bastard.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
          (intense)
     He is on the edge. He may be psychotic.

               MURPHY
     Bunch of psych bullshit- Look, can I
     pee now?

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     I think you’re making a mistake by
     leaving him in the field. He’s
     suicidal.

               MURPHY
     End of discussion.  We’re gonna wait.
     And then, if he offs himself ... Well,
     then we’ll know I was wrong.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Yes, sir.  Then we’ll know.

                               CUT TO:

EXT. SIMI VALLEY  -  NIGHT

Rain sweeps in off the desert. Cold. Drenching. Riggs walks
slowly toward his trailer home, head down. The RAIN BEATS
on him. He doesn’t notice. Under his arm he carries a large
cardboard box.

INT. RIGGS’ TRAILER - SAME TIME

Riggs enters, soaking wet.  Switches on the lamp.
Depressing. Jake appears, tail  a-thump. Tongue   wagging
doggishly. Riggs reaches atop the refrigerator, grabs a bag
of peanuts. Opens it, tosses it to the dog.

               RIGGS
     Sam, every day ... in every way ... I’m
     getting better and better.

Opens the box and removes its contents. Brand new color
TELEVISION. Plugs it in. Switches it ON. Sits down with a
bottle of whiskey. Drinks. On the screen, the Grinch steals
Christmas from the residents of Whoville.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Riggs opens a drawer beside him, and takes out a bottle of
sleeping pills. Picks it  up. As  he  does  --  the  sound
of the TELEVISION FADES OUT -- silence, dead silence... As
Riggs rolls the bottle in his fingers.  Slowly,
thoughtfully, unscrews the cap ... dumps them on the table.
Runs his  fingers through them. CLICK...  CLICK...  Stares.
Mesmerized. RAIN BEATS on the window.

EXT. TRAILER

The RAIN CONTINUES to hammer the lonely little pit which
Riggs calls home.

                               CUT TO:

L.A.P.D. - MORNING

A zoo. A sign reads METRO ROBBERY/HOMICIDE. Roger Murtaugh
sits at his desk, lost in thought. Behind him, McCASKEY,
Class Three Detective. He talks to Murtaugh:

               MCCASKEY
     See, you’re behind the times, Sarge.
     Guys in the Eighties aren’t tough.
     They’re sensitive people.  They show
     emotions around women and shit like
     that.
          (beat)
     I think I’m an Eighties man.

               MURTAUGH
     How you figure?

               MCCASKEY
     Last night:  I cried in bed, so how’s
     that?

               MURTAUGH
     Were you with a  woman?

               MCCASKEY
     No, I was alone, why the fuck you think
     I was crying?

               MURTAUGH
     Sounds like an Eighties man to me.

Another detective enters.  Rail-thin, nose like a beak. His
name is BURKE.

Behind him in the door frame we see a fat cop pass by down
the hall, walking backwards; a beat, and then he  is
followed by four more cops singing the world’s shittiest
rendition of “It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.” It sounds
like pigs mating. Burke approaches Murtaugh:

               BURKE
     Got some news on the Lloyd case, Rog.

               MURTAUGH
     That was quick.

               BURKE
     So was the autopsy.
          (takes a deep breath)
     You ready for this? They’re not calling
     it suicide.

               MURTAUGH
     What?

               BURKE
     Surprise, surprise. First off, coroner
     found evidence she took barbiturates.

               MURTAUGH
     Brilliant. There was an open bottle on
     her table.

               BURKE
     Right, right. That’s not the surprise.
     Surprise is someone doctored the pills.
          (beat)
     Every capsule was loaded with drain
     cleaner.

               MURTAUGH
     Jesus ...

               BURKE
     If she hadn’t jumped, she woulda been
     dead inside fifteen minutes.

               MURTAUGH
          (sighs)
     This case blows.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ACROSS the room, a detective takes off his gun and slings
the holster across his chair. As he EXITS FRAME -- PAN to
reveal: Martin Riggs as he enters the squad room.  Shuffles
from foot to foot, looking lost. Lights a smoke.

ACROSS ROOM

Murtaugh slings on a jacket. Turns to go. Notices Riggs.

MURTAUGH’S POV

Riggs resembles a bag person. Unshaven, limp dirty hair,
grimy leather jacket.

BACK TO SCENE

He frowns, says:

               MURTAUGH
     McCaskey, if my wife calls, tell her
     late dinner.

               BURKE
     Ho, Rog-  I’m not through yet. I’m
     supposed to tell you two more things.

               MURTAUGH
     Shoot.

He is still looking at Riggs, who is slowly wandering from
desk to desk, smoking -- Stopping near the desk with the
holstered gun.

               BURKE
     First, condition of the sheets and
     mattress indicate someone was in bed
     with Amanda Lloyd just before she died.
     That’s A.

               MURTAUGH
     What’s B?

               BURKE
     B is, I’m supposed to tell you you’re
     breaking in a new partner on this.

Now Murtaugh is eyeballing Riggs. Cautious.

               MURTAUGH
          (distracted)
     I don’t work partners.

               BURKE
     You do now. C.I.T. transfer, some
     burnout they want you to keep on a
     leash.

               MURTAUGH
     Oh, perfect. Can I trade in my life for
     a new one?

At which point, across the room, Riggs removes the hol-
stered gun and hefts it, curiously. Suddenly all hell
breaks loose:

               MURTAUGH
     Gun !!

He bolts like a cheetah. Cops dive for cover, a secretary
shrieks, and Murtaugh goes plowing through the squad room
like an express train, blowing people out of the way --
Cops grabbing for their holsters -- Riggs, meanwhile,
looking around frantically, he’s trying to find the guy
with the gun who is, of course, himself.
Murtaugh takes a flying leap sails across the desk, going
for  the glory   And Riggs, in the blink of an eye, simply
ducks and flips Murtaugh neatly over one shoulder. There is
a hideous crash of BREAKING GLASS and OVERTURNING
FURNITURE.  Ouch... McCaskey, meanwhile, screams to Burke:

               MCCASKEY
     What the shit is going on?

Burke sighs, shakes  his  head:

               BURKE
     Roger just met his new partner.

INT. OFFICE

Darkness.  A soft CLICK as a gun is cocked. The barrel
gleams faintly in the dim light. A voice:

               MAN (O’s.)
     There are three guns on you.

               VISITOR
     Easy.  Take it easy.
          (beat)
     I’m going to light a match.

He does. Holds it near his face.

               MAN (O’s.)
     Thank you, Mr. Mendez.

The lights come on. Dazzling. Mendez covers his eyes. Three
men. Seated in chairs. Shirt sleeves and shoulder holsters.
The LEADER speaks.

               LEADER
     If you’ll follow me, please.

               MENDEZ
     Who the hell are you?

               LEADER
     That’s hardly important.  If you like,
     you may call me Mr. Joshua.

               MENDEZ
     Swell.

They move toward a door in the rear wall.

               JOSHUA (LEADER)
     I trust you’re having a pleasant
     holiday season?

               MENDEZ
          (looks  at  him)
     Yeah. It’s a fucking joy, thank you.

INT. BACK OFFICE - SAME TIME

The door opens into a dimly-lit office.  Stained  carpet.
Rotten wood. A desk. Behind the desk sits a large, rugged
man with eyes like chips of stone. This is the GENERAL.

               GENERAL
     Yes, Joshua... ?  Ah, Mr. Mendez.
     Please, have a seat.

Joshua stands off to one side. Mendez sits.

               MENDEZ
          (under his breath)
     Where’d you get him?  Psychos ‘R.’ Us?

               GENERAL
     Hardly.

Points to another merc.

               MENDEZ
     I like the sunglasses. Very Hollywood.

               GENERAL
     Mr. Larch is unfortunately missing an
     eye. For anonymity’s sake, he chooses
     to forego wearing a patch.

               MENDEZ
     Swell. Blind people with guns. This is
     a class act.  Maybe we can run over to
     the V.A. and pick up a couple amputees.
     Bargain rates after six.

               GENERAL
     I don’t find you funny.

               MENDEZ
     I  don’t find this goddamn setup funny.
          (beat)
     You’re using mercenaries, for
     Chrissake.  Tell me I’m wrong.

               GENERAL
     No.  You’re not wrong.

               MENDEZ
     And I’m  supposed to trust these bozos?

               GENERAL
     My people are loyal, Mr. Mendez. They
     are loyal to me.

               MENDEZ
     Bullshit.

               GENERAL
     Joshua. Hold out your hand.

Joshua steps up to the General and extends his arm.

               GENERAL
     Do you smoke, Mr. Mendez?

               MENDEZ
     Yeah.

               GENERAL
     Give me  your lighter.

Mendez frowns, cautiously hands a silver cigarette lighter
to the General. Who promptly pulls an old G. Gordon Liddy
maneuver: He holds the flame right under Joshua’s hand.
Searing it. Mendez looks on, a trifle pale. As for Joshua,
he makes no sound at all. Simply stands, trance-like.

               GENERAL
     You wish to do business with us, yes?

               MENDEZ
     Jesus ...

               GENERAL
     Mr. Joshua is in a great deal of pain.
     You wish to make a purchase, yes?

               MENDEZ
     I ... yes. Sure. Jesus.

The General nods, hands the lighter back to Mendez.

               GENERAL
     Filthy habit, smoking.
          (beat)
     The bulk of the heroin will arrive
     Friday  night. We will make delivery at
     that time. Please have the money ready,
     and no tricks. If you try to cross us,
     I’ll have Joshua cut out your eyes.
          (beat)
     Merry Christmas.

EXT. UNMARKED POLICE  CAR  -  DAY

Riggs and Murtaugh cruise through downtown Los Angeles.
Riggs drives, while Murtaugh scowls. There is an awk- ward
pause.

               MURTAUGH
     Turn right.
          (beat)
     So.  They tell me you’re a good cop.

               RIGGS
     I try.

               MURTAUGH
     Heard about your  little  stunt
     yesterday.  Pretty heroic stuff.
          (as Riggs does not reply)
     File says you worked for the Phoenix
     Project in Vietnam, that right?

               RIGGS
     Yes.

               MURTAUGH
     Assassin stuff?

               RIGGS
     Maybe.

               MURTAUGH
     And they gave you the Congressional
     Medal of Honor.

               RIGGS
     It was a lean year.

               MURTAUGH
     It’s over, you know.

               RIGGS
     What is?

               MURTAUGH
     The war.

               RIGGS
     Yes. I know.

               MURTAUGH
     Just thought I’d remind you.
          (beat)
     Check out your piece?

He reaches across the get Riggs’ gun.  At which point
Riggs’ hand shoots out -- and stops him cold.

               RIGGS
     Bad manners, man.

Riggs removes the gun himself.  Steers with his knees.
Drops the chambered bullet.  Slips out the magazine, works
the slide,  KA-CHIK

Hands the gun to Murtaugh.

               RIGGS
     Don’t hurt yourself.

Murtaugh hefts the weapon, turning it over in his hand:
Beretta .9 millimeter. Smooth, well-oiled. Accurized.
Murtaugh frowns.

               MURTAUGH
     .9 millimeter  Beretta. That’s some
     serious shit.

               RIGGS
     Military switched from Colt  to Beretta
     in 1985. It’s a better piece. Wide
     ejection  port, no feed jams, no
     stovepipes.

               MURTAUGH
     What’s it take?

               RIGGS
     Fifteen in the mag, one up the pipe.
     You carry a wheelgun?

               MURTAUGH
     .38 Special.

               RIGGS
     Lot of old-timers carry that.

Murtaugh shoots him a look.  Replaces the gun.

               MURTAUGH
     File says you’re registered with Newark
     P.D. as a lethal weapon.

               RIGGS
     File don’t lie. Look, friend, let’s cut
     the shit. We both know why I was
     transferred. Everyone thinks I’m
     suicidal, in which case I’m fucked and
     no one wants to work with me. Or they
     think I’m faking to draw a psycho
     pension, in which case I’m fucked and
     no one wants to work with me.
     Basically, I’m  fucked.

               MURTAUGH
     Guess what?

               RIGGS
     What?

               MURTAUGH
     I don’t want to work with you.

               RIGGS
     Then don’t.

               MURTAUGH
     Ain’t got no choice.  Damn. We’re both
     fucked.

               RIGGS
     Terrific.

As they speak, Riggs has pulled to a stop in front of a
large downtown bank building.

               MURTAUGH
          (rubs  his  eyes)
     I’m very old ...
          (sighs)
     ... God hates me, that’s what it is.

               RIGGS
     Hate him back.  Works for me.

He lights a cigarette.

                               CUT TO:

41     INT. BANK  BUILDING  -  DAY                           41

Dick Lloyd’s office: everything about it looks starched and
perfect. In  the  b.g., bank employees shuttle  between
desks, building and toppling empires. DICK LLOYD  paces
back and forth. He is the man we saw earlier in  Amanda’s
photograph, standing next to Murtaugh.
Now he  looks like shit. He addresses Riggs and Murtaugh,
who  are seated in the office.

               LLOYD
     Murder ...  But  I  thought  ...

               MURTAUGH
     Poisoned.  Even if she hadn’t jumped
     ... she’d still be dead.

               LLOYD
     Jesus.
          (beat)
     Jesus,  I  can’t  take -------.

He sits, staring out the window. A broken man.

               MURTAUGH
     Dick, why did you call me yesterday?

               LLOYD
          (very  far  away)
     Called you...? Yeah. That’s right ... I
     heard you were working out here ... I
     wanted you to find her for me,  Roger.
     Take her

               MURTAUGH
     Out of what?

               LLOYD
     She did movies, Roger ... Naked movies
     ... Saw one of them......  saw my
     little baby ... smiling......  She did
     it ... with a woman. She    was on top
     of a woman, Roger-...!

               MURTAUGH
     Easy, Dick.

Lloyd turns, facing them.  Intense:

               LLOYD
     I want a promise.
          (beat)
     You owe me. You know you do.

               MURTAUGH
     Yes. I know that.

               LLOYD
     When you find who did it, I want you to
     kill them. If it’s more than one, I
     want you to kill all of them.
     Make them squirm first, take your time
     ... and fucking kill them.

               MURTAUGH
     I’m a police officer, Dick.

               LLOYD
     Forget the law. It’s easy to do. You
     owe me.

               MURTAUGH
          (pause; then)
     We have to go now.

Lloyd does not look up. Riggs and Murtaugh head for the
door.

               LLOYD
     I know you can, Roger. You kill them.
     You do that.

The cops exit. The door shuts.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Riggs and Murtaugh head ior the car.  Riggs takes out a
pack of cigarettes.

               MURTAUGH
     You gonna smoke in the car?

               RIGGS
     Thinking about it.

               MURTAUGH
     Terrific.

He puts the top down. Riggs takes out a cigarette, starts
to put it in his mouth. Stops.

               RIGGS
     Whoops.  Shit.

He replaces it in the pack, takes another. Murtaugh looks
at him.

               MURTAUGH
     What was wrong with that one?

Riggs points to the tip of the replaced cigarette.  We
notice two things: a) It looks like it’s about fifty years
old; and  b) There is a tiny red mark, circling the filter.

               RIGGS
     This one is the last cigarette I’ll
     ever smoke. Trick I learned from  my
     dad. I smoke all I want, but when I
     smoke this one ... I’m through.

               MURTAUGH
     Brilliant. Get in the car.

               RIGGS
     Want me to drive?

               MURTAUGH
     You’re suicidal, remember?

               RIGGS
     Anyone who drives in Los Angeles is
     suicidal.

They get in. Murtaugh heaves a sigh, stares bleakly out the
window. A moment, then Riggs says:

               RIGGS
     He said you owed him. What did he mean?

               MURTAUGH
     We served together in ‘65. He saved my
     life in the La Drang Valley. Took a
     bayonet in the lung.

               RIGGS
     That was nice of him.

               MURTAUGH
     I thought so.

The RADIO SQUAWKS. Murtaugh  TURNS  it  UP.

               DISPATCHER   (V.O.)
     All units and seven eight twenty-one,
     possible jumper at the corner of Santa
     Monica and La Cienega, seven eight
     twenty-one handle code two.

Murtaugh keys the hand mike.

               MURTAUGH
     Four King Sixty en route.

               RIGGS
     This is great. I love this job.

               MURTAUGH
     Stow it.

EXT. CITY INTERSECTION - DAY

A building, ten stories high. On the ledge, a lone man
poised high above the street. Beneath him, a crowd has
gathered. A police car. A searchlight. A crowd of office
workers, rubber-necking to beat the band. One or two kids
yell, ÓJump, jump.Ô MurtaughÒs car glides to the curb.  The
doors burst open and the two partners emerge. A PATROL COP
approaches.

               PATROL  COP
     Hey, Sarge, you wanna handle this?

               MURTAUGH
     WhereÒs the psychologist?

               PATROL  COP
     Sitting in traffic.

               MURTAUGH
     Swell.
          (beat)
     WhoÒs the guy?

               PATROL  COP
     Salesman name of MacCleary. Left the
     office party. Went upstairs and walked
     out on the ledge.

               MURTAUGH
     Think heÒll go?

               PATROL  COP
     Seems serious enough. Who knows?

Riggs clears his throat. Murtaugh turns.

               RIGGS
     I can handle this.

               MURTAUGH
     You qualified to talk to jumpers?

               RIGGS
     IÒve done it before.

               MURTAUGH
          (reluctant;  then)
     Okay. YouÒre elected.
          (as Riggs) turns to go)
     Hey.
          (as Riggs stops)
     No guns. No kung fu. Just ... bring him
     in.

               RIGGS
     Sure. Bring him in.

               MURTAUGH
     Right.

Riggs moves off toward the building. Murtaugh looks after
him. Was this a mistake ... ?

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Riggs appears on the roof. There, about five yards away,
stands the JUMPER. Agitated. Breathing hard. Below is ten
stories of open space. The wind blows. Riggs nods to the
Jumper.

               MACCLEARY (JUMPER)
     Go away.

               RIGGS
     My name is Riggs.

               MACCLEARY
     Fuck off.

               RIGGS
     I canÒt do that.
          (beat)
     WhatÒs your name?

               MACCLEARY
     Look, I know all the psychology
     bullshit, it wonÒt work.

               RIGGS
     IÒm not a psychologist.

               MACCLEARY
     Yeah?  What are you?

               RIGGS
     Homicide cop.

               MACCLEARY
     YouÒre early.  Hang on a couple
     minutes, you can go to work.

               RIGGS
     At least tell me your name.  Look, I
     gotta fill out the little piece of
     paper.  Okay?

               MACCLEARY
          (swallows)
     Len. Len MacCleary.

               RIGGS
     Thanks.   ÑPreciate it.
          (beat)
     That M -- C ... ?

               MACCLEARY
     M -- A -- C, now get outta here.

Riggs leans out farther, perches on the ledge.  Absolutely
calm.

               RIGGS
     Why are you doing this?

               MACCLEARY
     None of your goddamn business.

               RIGGS
     Fair enough.
          (pause; then)
     IÒm coming out. Take it easy.

Riggs stands, steps out onto the narrow ledge. He seems
unconcerned.

               MACCLEARY
     DonÒt come near me!

               RIGGS
     Ssshhh. Easy. IÒm just going to talk.

               MACCLEARY
     Touch me and IÒll jump.

               RIGGS
     I understand.

EXT. BUILDING - DAY

On the ground below, Roger Murtaugh reacts with disbelief.
His partner is taking an insane risk. Up above, Riggs
pauses. Around him the WIND BLOWS treacherously.

               RIGGS
     YouÒre not the first guy to think of
     this, you know. EveryoneÒs got
     problems.

               MACCLEARY
     You know shit.

               RIGGS
     Wrong. YouÒre wrong.
          (beat)
     I almost tried this once. Seriously.
     My wife. Got killed in a car crash.
     Only person I ever cared about. I never
     had kids.

MacCLEARY

YouÒre breaking my heart.

Riggs takes out his wallet, flashes it at MacCleary.

               RIGGS
     This is her picture.

               MACCLEARY
     Nice.  Fuck off.

               RIGGS
     IÒm trying to tell you I understand,
     you dope.

He takes a step closer.

               MACCLEARY
     DonÒt touch me. IÒm not doing anything
     wrong.

               RIGGS
     I know that. Not like youÒre murdering
     anyone.

               MACCLEARY
     Right. Only one hurt is me.

               RIGGS
     Same way I look at it. IÒm gonna stand
     beside you, okay?

               MACCLEARY
     No!
          (beat)
     Dammit, keep away.

               RIGGS
     Please. This is scary stuff. Just ...
     let me stand next to you.

               MACCLEARY
     DonÒt try nothing.

               RIGGS
     I try something, we both go.

               MACCLEARY
     Right.

Riggs slowly steps up to the man.  Shudders.

               RIGGS
     There. FuckinÒ cold,up here.
          (beat)
     Helluva day for both of us, huh?
          (looks  around  at the sea of
           traffic far below)
     Here we are.
          (beat)
     God, this is really scary. IÒm scared.

               MACCLEARY
     Me,  too.

               RIGGS
     You wanna smoke?
          (pulls out cigarettes)
     LetÒs smoke, okay?

               MACCLEARY
     Sure.

Riggs offers a smoke. MacCleary reaches for it. And Riggs
snaps a handcuff on his wrist. Snaps the other end onto his
own wrist.

               MACCLEARY
     Hey ...

               RIGGS
     Sorry.
          (beat)
     See  this  key?

He holds up the key to the cuffs. Flings it out into space.

               RIGGS
     WeÒre together on this. You can go if
     you want. But you take me with  you.
     Makes you a murderer.

               MACCLEARY
     You bastard.

               RIGGS
     YouÒll be killing a cop.

Silence.

               RIGGS
     IÒm going inside.  What say you come
     with me?

He turns, starts to ease along the ledge.  MacCleary
swallows hard, says:

               MACCLEARY
     Fuck you, IÒm jumping.

And suddenly Riggs turns on him. Eyes like steel.

               RIGGS
     You wanna jump ... ? You really want to
     ... ?
          (long  pause; then)
     Fine. LetÒs do it.

He steps to the edge.

               MACCLEARY
     Hey, what the fuck ...

               RIGGS
     You asked for it.

               MACCLEARY
     Hey, wait a minute ... !

Riggs does something very drastic. He jerks them both off
the ledge. Holy shit. The crowd gasps.

               RIGGS
     Geronimoooooo ...

As down they plunge, all ten stories -- Tumbling and
falling -- MacCleary shrieking like a lunatic ... And
suddenly, BAM -- ! They land in a firemanÒs net. Bounce a
few times. Come to rest, safe and unharmed  ...
Riggs rolls over with a sour look on his face. Cops
surround them. MacCleary is a trifle upset.

               MACCLEARY
     Get him away from me!!  Cut me loose!!
     Crazy fucker tried to kill me!! Did you
     see that?? He tried to kill  me!!!

And so on, screaming and ranting -- As a uniformed  cop
cuts Riggs free with a set of clippers. Riggs stands
shakily. Steps away from the net. And there is Roger
Murtaugh. Visibly upset. Did I say upset? I meant enraged.
He grabs Riggs, slams him against the wall.  Tries to grab
his collar. RiggsÒ hand shoots out.  Lightning fast. Stops
MurtaughÒs hand. Stops it cold.  They stare into each
otherÒs eyes.

               RIGGS
     DonÒt ... touch me.

Murtaugh will not back down.

               MURTAUGH
     What the fuck did you just do???

               RIGGS
     I controlled the jump. You wanted him
     down. HeÒs down.

               MURTAUGH
     CÒmere.

He yanks Riggs around the corner, away from the other cops.

               MURTAUGH
     Okay, turkey, no bullshit. Do you want
     to kill yourself?

               RIGGS
     Aw, for Chrissake ...

               MURTAUGH
     Shut up. Just yes or no, do you want to
     die? Huh? Yes or no?

               RIGGS
     I got the job done.

               MURTAUGH
     YouÒre not answering the question!!!

               RIGGS
          (angry)
     What do you wanna hear, man?
     You wanna hear that I got a bottle of
     pills in my room? I do. Every day I
     wake up, I look for a reason not to
     take them. Doing the job, thatÒs ...
     thatÒs the reason.

Murtaugh looks at him. Nods. A moment, then:

               MURTAUGH
     You want to die.

               RIGGS
     IÒm not afraid of it.

               MURTAUGH
     Here.
          (unholsters his gun)
     Pills are too slow. Use a gun.Use my
     gun. Go ahead, pal.

A pause. Riggs looks at the gun.

               MURTAUGH
     Be my guest.

He offers the gun to Riggs.

               MURTAUGH
     Go ahead. If youÒre serious.

Riggs smiles, takes the gun without missing a beat. Puts it
to his head. CLICK -- ! The hammer is cocked. Murtaugh and
Riggs stare each other down. Tense. Reading each  other.

               RIGGS
     You shouldnÒt tempt me, Roger.

               MURTAUGH
     Put it in your mouth. Bullet goes in
     your ear, might not kill you.

Meanwhile, in the b.g., pedestrians are diving for cover.
Murtaugh and Riggs are oblivious. Riggs puts the gun under
his chin.

               RIGGS
     Under the chinÒs just as good.

They stare at each other. RiggsÒ finger begins to tighten
on the trigger.  Turns white with pressure. It looks like
heÒs going to do it. At the last second, Murtaugh jams his
thumb in front of the hammer, and CLICK Jesus ...

The hammer thuds against his thumb. Murtaugh grabs the gun.
Stares at Riggs, wild-eyed.

               MURTAUGH
     Jesus. YouÒre not trying to draw a
     psycho pension.
          (beat)
     YouÒre really crazy ...

               RIGGS
          (smiles coldly)
     So now you know.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah. Now I know.

INT. POLICE  LINEUP  -  DAY

The Police Psychologist we met earlier  is talking on the
telephone:

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     YouÒre asking me if heÒs stable and IÒm
     telling you no.  WeÒre talking about a
     man who carves notches in his gun
     barrel. One for each kill. He blew a
     man to Pieces yesterday. Is this
     helping?

                                      INTERCUT:

ROGER MURTAUGH

Standing at a pay phone, listening.  He nods:

               MURTAUGH
     Terrific.  So youÒre saying I should
     worry.

               PSYCHOLOGIST
     Are you kidding?  The guyÒs a time
     bomb.  When he goes... stand back.

               MURTAUGH
     Thank you, Doctor.  YouÒve been very
     helpful.

He hangs up.  Rubs his eyes tiredly and says:

               MURTAUGH
     IÒm too old for this shit.

                               CUT TO:

INT. MURTAUGHÒS CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

Silence. Murtaugh fumes. Riggs keeps his mouth shut.
Murtaugh takes his anger out on the road: SLAMMING the
BRAKES; SQUEALING around corners, etc. But he canÒt hold it
in. He explodes:

               MURTAUGH
          (pounding his fist against the
           wheel)
     ItÒs my  birthday, damnit!  Fifty years
     old today! Fifty goddamn years old!
     Thirty years on the force! Not a
     scratch on me! Not a scar! I got a
     wife! Kids! House! Fishing boat! But  I
     can kiss all that goodbye, Ñcause  my
     new partnerÒs got a death wish! My
     fuckinÒ life is over!

               RIGGS
     Roger --

               MURTAUGH
     Shut up! Why you talkinÒ to me?! IÒm
     not here anymore! IÒm  gone! IÒm dead!
     YouÒre gonna see to that! You wanna die
     -- and youÒre gonna take me with you!

Silence again. Murtaugh gnashes his teeth. Riggs looks at
him with a very serious expression.

               RIGGS
     I didnÒt know  that.

               MURTAUGH
     Know what?!

               RIGGS
     That today was your birthday.
          (beat)
     Happy Birthday, Roger.  I mean that
     sincerely.

Murtaugh looks taken aback by the genuine sound of affec-
tion in RiggsÒ voice.

               RIGGS
     I just hope we stay alive long enough
     for me to buy you a present.

Riggs says this with a straight face -- but there is a
playful glint in his eye that Murtaugh doesnÒt miss.
And he laughs out loud in spite of himself. It breaks the
tension, and Riggs knows  it.

               RIGGS
     Where we going?

               MURTAUGH
     Beverly Hills.
          (beat)
     Got an address on Amanda HunseckerÒs
     meal ticket. But remember ... this guy
     isnÒt a suspect yet.  WeÒre gonna
     question him; not damage him.

Riggs raises his hands -- as if to say, IÒll be on my best
behavior. Murtaugh swings the car onto Sunset Blvd.

49     EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - TWILIGHT                  49

The kind of house that IÒll buy if this movie is a huge
hit. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood. Plus an outdoor solarium:
A glass structure, like a greenhouse only thereÒs a big
swimming pool inside. This is a really great place to have
sex.

INT. SOLARIUM

The swimming pool is covered by a vinyl tarpaulin.
Surrounded by a jungle of plants.

AT POOLSIDE TABLE

Sits a very rich person. He is wearing an $800 designer
ensemble. Beside him, an elegantly-appointed shotgun leans
against the table. He is on the phone.

               RICH GUY
     Listens asshole, you gotta tell me
     these things ... Yeah, we got a
     problem. My margin is completely fucked
     up, and we got athletes snorting the
     shit and pitching over dead, howÒs that
     for a problem... ?  Yes, IÒm holding
     two keys now.  Terrific, call me back.

                               CUT TO:

EXT. WOODEN GATE - SAME TIME

Riggs and Murtaugh approach the gate. Riggs tosses out a
cigarette. Suddenly -- There is an ELECTRIC HUM and the
gate glides softly open, admitting a red Honda scooter, a
dashing blonde behind the wheel.
She ROARS off down the street. Riggs and Murtaugh exchange
glances. The GATE CLICKS, starts to glide shut. The cops
enter.

53     EXT. HOUSE WINDOW - SAME TIME                         53

RiggsÒ face comes INTO FRAME, peering cautiously through a
plate glass window. He whistles softly.

               RIGGS
     Take a look.

Murtaugh steps to the window, looks in.

MURTAUGHÒS POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW

Enough cocaine to service the third tier at Yankee Stadium.
A BLONDE, BIKINI-CLAD WONDER sits on the couch, happily
snorting. She sees Murtaugh and waves hilariously. Makes
come-hither gestures. Murtaugh scowls, turns to Riggs.

               RIGGS
     IÒm thinking probable cause.

               MURTAUGH
     Jesus. Maybe I should call for backup.

               RIGGS
     What am I, chopped liver?

Murtaugh looks at him. Sighs.

               MURTAUGH
     No killing.

               RIGGS
     No killing.

He grins cheesily-

EXT. SOLARIUM

Riggs and Murtaugh approach the frosted glass door.  They
draw their guns.

               MURTAUGH
     Nice and easy.

               RIGGS
     Nice and easy.

Murtaugh takes a deep breath. Kicks open the door.

               MURTAUGH
     Police.  Hold it right there.

INT. SOLARIUM

The rich guy does not hold it right there. In fact, he has
already snatched up the SHOTGUN. He triggers a BLAST, BLOWS
OUT GLASS next to Murtaugh. Murtaugh  dives, rolls, comes
up in a combat crouch.  BAM --- The rich guy takes it in
the shoulder. Spins around. The gun clatters to the ground.
Riggs and Murtaugh approach, guns drawn. The rich guy
writhes on the ground, clutching his shoulder.  Murtaugh
says to Riggs:

               MURTAUGH
     See how easy that was?  Boom. Still
     alive. Now we take the gun away ...
          (he does)
     ... And we question him. Know why we
     can question him? Because I got him in
     the shoulder. I didnÒt blow him up or
     jump off a building with him.

               RIGGS
     No fair, the building guy lived.

               MURTAUGH
     Whatever. The point is, no killing.

               RIGGS
     No killing.

               MURTAUGH
     Right. Piece  of  cake.  IÒm  very
     happy. Read the  man  his  rights, IÒll
     be over here being happy.

Unfortunately ... as Murtaugh speaks, he does not see  the
man on the ground has a hideaway gun tucked into his
waistband. As Murtaugh talks, oblivious ... The guy  takes
out the gun with his good arm -- and aims dead  center-at
MurtaughÒs back. Riggs, however, notices.  And springs into
action. Before the rich guy can fire  ...  RiggsÒ foot
flashes out like a pile driver. CRACK! The guy flies
backward. Lands on top of the pool tarpaulin.  Oops. It
promptly surrounds him in a sucking, vice-like grip.
Murtaugh dives forward and extends his hand. Too late. The
vinyl surrounds the screaming rich guy, sucks him below the
surface. Smothers him. Drags him to the bottom. Murtaugh
looks on, wild-eyed. On the bottom of the pool is a vinyl
tomb. Murtaugh dives in. Swims to the  bottom.  Yanks, and
strains, but we all know itÒs no fucking use. The vinyl
stops moving. Murtaugh stares... and then he gives up.
Surfaces at the side of the pool, gasping and wheezing.
Riggs kneels down beside him.

               RIGGS
     Oops.

Murtaugh stares daggers at him.

               MURTAUGH
     Have you ... ever... met someone you
     didnÒt kill... ?

               RIGGS
     HavenÒt killed you yet.

               MURTAUGH
     Terrific, you want a little  gold star?
          (lie pulls out a soaked pack of
           cigarettes)
     Shit.

EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME - LATER

Behind Riggs and Murtaugh, crime scene cops scurry back and
forth.  Flashing lights. Cameras. Murtaugh makes his way to
the car. Riggs beside him. As they reach the car, Murtaugh
stops:

               MURTAUGH
     Look, IÒ m sorry I said that shit back
     there.
          (beat)
     You saved my life. Thank you.

               RIGGS
     I bet that hurt to say.

               MURTAUGH
     You have no idea.

INT. MURTAUGH HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

The two detectives come through the front door, shedding
their jackets. Young Carrie appears, nursing a Popsicle.

               CARRIE
     Hi, Daddy. Is that a crook?

               MURTAUGH
     No, honey, this is Martin, my partner.
          (scoops her up; hugs her)
     Tell Martin what you think of crooks.

               CARRIE
     Buttheads.
          (giggles)
     TheyÒre buttheads.

               RIGGS
     KidÒs no dummy.

               CARRIE
     Daddy, Mommy says you hate her cooking.

               MURTAUGH
     Tell Mommy hate is a mild word.

INT. KITCHEN

Trish is cooking as the two cops enter.

               MURTAUGH
     Hi, honey.
          (he  looks  in the oven)
     WeÒre having something brown... A
     largish brown object  ...

               TRISH
     ItÒs roast.

               MURTAUGH
     Dammit, I wanted to guess. Honey, this
     is Martin, my new partner. HeÒll be
     joining us tonight, okay?

               TRISH
     Sure. Roast okay with you, Martin?

               RIGGS
     Fine.

               MURTAUGH
     How about brown, roast-like substance?

               TRISH
     Roger, youÒre being an asshole.
          (kisses his ear)
     DonÒt forget to compliment Rianne on
     her shoes.

               MURTAUGH
     Got it. Drink, Martin?

               RIGGS
     Bourbon, if you have it.

Murtaugh exits. Riggs stands awkwardly as Trish removes the
roast from the oven.

               RIGGS
     My wife could burn water.

               TRISH
     YouÒre married?

               RIGGS
     I was. SheÒs dead now.

               TRISH
     Oh. IÒm sorry.

               RIGGS
     No problem.

He reaches for a stray piece of roast.  Trish slaps his
hand.

               TRISH
     DonÒt pick.-

Riggs smiles.  A genuine smile, the first weÒve seen.

INT. LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME

Murtaugh is fixing drinks as RIANNE enters. We all heave a
sigh. She is strictly to perish for.

               RIANNE
     Hello, Father.

               MURTAUGH
     Hello, daughter. Nice shoes.

               RIANNE
     Oh, Daddy, arenÒt they great?

               MURTAUGH
     Absolutely.  How much they cost?

               RIANNE
     A hundred and ten dollars.  Do you
     really like them?

               MURTAUGH
     A hundred and --
          (frowns)
     -- TheyÒre shoes.

               RIANNE
     Right.

               MURTAUGH
     You wear them on your feet.

               RIANNE
     Right.

               MURTAUGH
     And thatÒs all they do ... ? ThereÒs
     not, like a TV inside?

               RIANNE
     Nope.

               MURTAUGH
          (shakes his head)
     IÒm very old.

INT. MURTAUGHÒS DEN

Young Nick Murtaugh is sitting in front of the TELE-
VISION, watching a ÓCharley Brown ChristmasÔ and coloring
a picture with a big box of crayons. He stops. Frowns.
Looks up -- At Martin Riggs, who is peeking his head around
the corner, watching with rapt fascination.  Riggs
chuckles, points to the screen:

               RIGGS
     This is good. I like this.

Nick looks at him very strangely. Okay, so the guy likes
cartoons ...

INT. DINING ROOM - MEALTIME

Everyone is gathered, eating. Incredibly homey and domestic-
looking. For Riggs, who eats ravenously, it is the first
taste of warmth in many a long year.

ACROSS THE TABLE

We notice something kind of neat: Rianne simply cannot take
her eyes off Riggs. She stares at him, in a trance.  Her
brother NICK nudges her in the ribs.  She pulls a face.

MURTAUGH

Has also noticed his daughterÒs attentions, and you can bet
heÒs not all that happy about it.

63.    EXT. MURTAUGHÒS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - BOAT - NIGHT          63.

Trish Murtaugh wheeling garbage pail to curbside.

               TRISH
          (sarcastically)
     ThatÒs okay, honey. IÒll take out the
     garbage.

Boat. MurtaughÒs head appears sheepishly from within.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.  Thanks, honey.

On board boat, Murtaugh is working on the engine. Riggs
sitting on driverÒs seat.

               MURTAUGH
     Whaddaya think?

               RIGGS
     You know anything about boats, Roger?

               MURTAUGH
     Know how much they cost.

               RIGGS
     I mean, can you sail this thing?

               MURTAUGH
     WhatÒs wrong with you? This ainÒt a
     sail boat.

               RIGGS
          (smiling)
     ThatÒs what I thought.

               MURTAUGH
     No trick to it. ThatÒs the front.
     ThatÒs the back. Water all around. Why
     you gotta make things so complicated?

               RIGGS
     I donÒt. ThatÒs just how they are.

Murtaugh opens an ice chest, takes a beer for himself and
tosses one to Riggs.

               MURTAUGH
     Oh, yeah. You mean Amanda HunsackerÒs
     murder?

               RIGGS
     Now, did I mention that?

               MURTAUGH
     You donÒt have to. I can read your
     mind.

Riggs makes no reply. He just looks at Murtaugh over the
rim of his beer can.

               MURTAUGH
     I donÒt get you, Riggs.  WhatÒs the
     problem? We got one dead girl and one
     dead guy. Dead guy killed the dead girl
     and we killed the dead guy Ñcause he
     wanted us to be dead guys. Seems pretty
     easy to me.

Riggs has wandered over to the instrument panel.  He in-
spects the switches and gauges.

               MURTAUGH
     Look, her sugar daddy was dealinÒ
     drugs.  She said somethinÒ... or did
     somethinÒ... or saw somethinÒ she
     shouldnÒt have, and he pitched her off
     the balcony into the sweet by-anÒ-by.
          (beat)
     ThatÒs why he came at us today with a
     shotgun.

               RIGGS
     I donÒt  know. Sounds a little too neat
     to me.

               MURTAUGH
     Of course itÒs neat. And whatÒs wrong
     with neat?  I like neat.

Riggs flips a switch and the MOTOR ROARS to life. Murtaugh
leaps up.

               MURTAUGH
     Hey!  Watch  what  youÒre  doinÒ!

Murtaugh fumbles with the switches in a futile effort to
turn off the engine. But Riggs knows exactly which switch
to flip.

               RIGGS
     LookinÒ for this?

He silences the engine. Murtaugh glares at him.

               MURTAUGH
     You asshole.

               RIANNE
     Hi, Dad...

Murtaugh jumps, startled by his daughterÒs arrival. Rianne
and Riggs exchange a glance.

               MURTAUGH
     What is it, Rianne?

               RIANNE
     Mark wants to take me  out  to  a club
     tomorrow night.

               MURTAUGH
     YouÒre grounded -- you know that.

               RIANNE
     Please, Daddy ...

               MURTAUGH
     Which one is Mark, anyway?

               RIANNE
     The blond one.

               MURTAUGH
     Oh, yeah. The one with pits in his
     face.

               RIANNE
     Those are dimples.

               MURTAUGH
     Those are pits. When he smiles, I can
     see through his head.
          (beat)
     The answer is no. End of story.

               RIGGS
     CÒmon, Rog. Have a heart.

Murtaugh looks at Riggs -- not appreciative of his
intervention.

               MURTAUGH
     The girl was smoking pot in the house.
     SheÒs grounded!

               RIANNE
     Next time IÒll just  take a beer
     instead.  Why can I have a beer and not
     a joint?  ItÒs not coke, you  know,
     Dad.

Murtaugh looks down sheepishly at the can of beer in his
hand. Riggs grins to himself.

               MURTAUGH
     ÑCause right now, beerÒs legal and
     grass ainÒt. Right or wrong.

               RIANNE
     Wrong.

               RIGGS
     Right.

She stalks off.  After a moment, Murtaugh looks over to
Riggs.

               MURTAUGH
     IÒve lost track... did we resolve
     anything  here  tonight?

Riggs shakes his head, smiles and starts to climb off the
boat.

               RIGGS
     Yeah. We resolved that your wife takes
     out the garbage. Your daughter smokes
     pot, which is illegal but shouldnÒt be -
     - that you donÒt know from boats, and
     you got one hell of a family, guy.

Walking towards truck together.

               MURTAUGH
     Thanks.

               RIGGS
     Enjoyed the meal.

               MURTAUGH
     Bullshit, but thanks anyway.

A pause.  Riggs stands there. Then:

               RIGGS
     You donÒt trust me at all, do you?

               MURTAUGH
     Tell you what. Make it through tomorrow
     without killing anybody. Especially
     me. Or  yourself. Then IÒll start
     trusting you.

               RIGGS
     Fair enough.

He walks toward his truck.  Stops.

               RIGGS
     I do it real good, you know.

               MURTAUGH
     Do what?

               RIGGS
     Kill people ... Only thing I ever did
     good. When I was nineteen, I did a guy
     in Laos from a thousand yards out.
     Rifle shot in high wind.
          (beat)
     Ten guys in the world coulda made that
     shot. Huh. Only thing I was ever good
     at.
          (pause;  then)
     Well, see you tomorrow.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah. See  you  then.

Riggs drives away. Murtaugh watches him. Turns. On the way
back inside, he flicks on the Christmas lights.

OMITTED

EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

Martin Riggs cruises along in his battered pickup truck
past all-night dives and porno houses.  The streets are
nearly deserted. Except for a young HOOKER on the cor- ner.
Real young, maybe seventeen.  Riggs sees her and pulls over
to the curb. The Hooker approaches.

               HOOKER
     Hi, handsome.  Looking for something?

               RIGGS
     ArenÒt we all?

               HOOKER
          (nods)
     Are you affiliated with any law
     enforcement organization?

               RIGGS
          (pause;  then)
     No. Get in the car.

She does. Closes the door.

               RIGGS
     How old are you?

               HOOKER
     Twenty-two.

               RIGGS
     Bullshit.

               HOOKER
     Why, you like Ñem young?

               RIGGS
     Younger the better.  How old are you?

               HOOKER
          (almost shyly)
     Sixteen.

Riggs nods. Takes out a hundred-dollar bill and sets it in
her lap.

               HOOKER
     Wow.
          (beat)
     So, what do you want?

               RIGGS
     I want you to come home and watch
     television with me.

He drives away from the curb.

INT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

The house is dark and quiet at this hour. Roger Murtaugh
fixes a sandwich in the kitchen. Rickles the CAT PURRS,
rubs against his leg.

               MURTAUGH
     Hey.

He kicks it aside. Notices a package on the counter,
together with a scribbled crayon note:

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SERGEANT MURTAUGH

The gift is a 99c special, right off the rack at Pic NÒ
Save:  The TUFF NÒ READY Police Action Playset; Tiny
plastic gun, made in Taiwan.  Tiny plastic badge. Murtaugh
smiles. Notices another package next to it. Frowns.  Its
label reads:  ROGER MURTAUGH:  POLICE EVIDENCE.

INT. LIVING ROOM

He opens the package. Two  things: a high school year-
book; also a videocassette. Takes it, slides it into a VCR
machine.  Turns on the television.

                                   TIME CUT TO:

INT./EXT. RIGGSÒ TRAILER - NIGHT

The Hooker watches TV -- really enjoying the Three Stooges.
Riggs stands apart from  her. HeÒs  not watch- ing TV; heÒs
watching her watching TV. He wears a melancholy expression.
The world is full of happy families like MurtaughÒs, but he
has to get by like this. His eyes shift to a photo of his
wife.  He picks it up and views it sadly.

               HOOKER
          (turning to him)
     YouÒre not having a very good time,
     are you?

Riggs puts down the photo.

               RIGGS
          (sweetly)
     You donÒt know that. Maybe this is how
     I look when IÒm having a good time.
     Maybe IÒm having the best time of my
     life.

               HOOKER
          (after a beat)
     Are you?

Riggs doesnÒt answer.

               HOOKER
     I know... sing me something.

               RIGGS
     I donÒt sing.

               HOOKER
     Come on. Sing me a song.

               RIGGS
     I donÒt know any songs.

               HOOKER
     Not even a Christmas song? Everybody
     knows a Christmas song.

Riggs shrugs and makes a half-hearted attempt:

               RIGGS
     Something through the snow, in a one-
     horse open sleigh ...

               HOOKER
     Good. ThatÒs good.
          (helps him out)
     Over the hills we go, laughing all the
     way.

               RIGGS
     Something something ring, making
     something bright ...

               HOOKER
     Oh, what fun it is to ride ...

               RIGGS
     To grandmaÒs house tonight!

They know they got it wrong, but  theyÒre pleased with
themselves just the same. The Hooker hugs Riggs impul-
sively. Riggs looks uncomfortable. HeÒd like to show her
some platonic affection, but he knows thatÒs impossible.

He gently unwraps her arms from around his neck.

               RIGGS
     I better take you back now.

SAME PLACE - LITTLE  BIT  LATER

Murtaugh is in front of the TV. On  his  lap  is  a  high
school yearbook. Open to the middle. He glances down, sees -
- a photograph of Amanda Lloyd. Senior picture. Smiling.
Young. The girl most likely to. He looks up up at the
television. On the screen Amanda Lloyd is writhing  in
ecstasy. Smiling. Murtaugh  continues  to watch.
Lights another cigarette. There is a sad, faraway look on
his face.

                               CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Very late now. Murtaugh walks down the  hall to a  bedroom
door. Opens it a fraction. Inside -- His daughter Rianne is
asleep. A shaft of moonlight falls across the bed. She is
more beautiful than weÒve ever seen her. Murtaugh crosses
to the bed, leans down, and kisses  her forehead. She stirs
in her sleep, smiles like a cat, and whispers:

               RIANNIE
     ... Mark ...

Murtaugh recoils. Stands up. We realize that up until this
moment, see, he thought she was maybe a virgin ...

INT. MURTAUGHÒS BEDROOM

He takes off his robe, drapes it on a chair. Gets into bed
silently next to his sleeping wife. Lies awake, staring up
at the ceiling.  The RAIN BEATS on the window, throwing odd
shadows across his face. He drifts  toward sleep.  As he
does, we ever so slowly ...

                                     CROSS FADE TO:

INT. MURTAUGH BEDROOM

Sunlight streams through the windows, Murtaugh stirs
groggily, forces open his eyes. Staring him in the face is
Martin RiggsÒ scruffy, early morning  face. Murtaugh
frowns.

               MURTAUGH
     ... Martin...  ?

               RIGGS
     Good morning, Roger. IÒve been doing a
     little thinking.

Murtaugh just stares at him.

               RIGGS
     About the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

Murtaugh grimaces.

               MURTAUGH
     Do you know what time it is ... ?

               RIGGS
     Day time?

               MURTAUGH
     IÒll get dressed.

                               CUT TO:

INT. MURTAUGH KITCHEN

In the kitchen Trish is singing something bluesy, fixing
coffee. At the table Nick is drinking milk. Murtaugh sits.
Riggs takes off his shoulder holster, and with meticulous
care drapes it delicately over the back of his chair. Sits
opposite Murtaugh.

               RIGGS
     YouÒre seriously using ketchup?

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.

               RIGGS
     On eggs.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.
          (beat)
     Who made the ketchup?

               RIGGS
     Heinz.

               MURTAUGH
     Who made the eggs?

Riggs looks to Trish.

               TRISH
          (across the room)
     You two are so hilarious I could bust.

Riggs leans forward.

               RIGGS
     Roger.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.

               RIGGS
     That hooker who witnessed the jump the
     other night. What was her name?

               MURTAUGH
     Dixie.

               CARRIE
     WhatÒs a hooker?

               MURTAUGH
     Shh, quiet, IÒm combatting crime.

               NICK
     A hooker is a ...

               RIGGS
          (interrupts)
     Right, and sheÒs in Century City
     witnessing Amanda HunsakerÒs suicide

               MURTAUGH
     or murder --

               RIGGS
     right, or murder, and my question is...
     what is she doing there?  I called
     Wilshire Vice, thatÒs not her usual
     turf.

               MURTAUGH
     Wow.
          (beat)
     Wow. ThatÒs really reaching.

               RIGGS
     Cut me a break, itÒs a hunch, Roger.
     IÒm having a hunch.

               MURTAUGH
     You couldnÒt have it at home, you had
     to come here at 7:30 A.M. and have it.

               RIGGS
     7:35, and yes, I thought youÒd be
     excited.

               MURTAUGH
     IÒm thrilled.
          (pause)
     Okay.

               RIGGS
     Okay, what?

               MURTAUGH
     Okay, go for it.  IÒm listening.

                               CUT TO:

INT. OUTDOOR FIRING PANGE - DAY

Riggs and Murtaugh stand on line at the range. Around them
the echoing BOOM of gunshots fills the morning air. They
struggle to be heard over the tumult:

               MURTAUGH
     We know someone was in bed with Amanda
     Lloyd the night she died.

               RIGGS
     Right. ÑTil now we assumed it was a
     man.

               MURTAUGH
     Okay. LetÒs say it was Dixie.

               RIGGS
     Okay. Disgusting, but okay: LetÒs say
     Dixie slipped the drain cleaner into
     the pills.

               MURTAUGH
     Say someone paid her to do it.

               RIGGS
     Sure. She  thinks, terrific, Amanda
     swallows a couple downers and boom,
     sheÒs dead. Then Dixie --

               MURTAUGH
     If it was her --

               RIGGS
     Right, right, then Dixie has plenty of
     time to spritz the place up, get out,
     whatever.

               MURTAUGH
     Except Amanda jumps out the window.

               RIGGS
     Or Dixie pushes her. Either way

               MURTAUGH
     Either way, sheÒs gotta make a fast
     getaway, Ñcause now the bodyÒs public.
     She hauls ass downstairs.

               RIGGS
     People are coming out to see what
     happened.

               MURTAUGH
     Someone spots her. She says Ñshit.Ò

               RIGGS
     Right. She actually stops and says,
     ÑShit.Ò

               MURTAUGH
     Or, ÑDamn.Ò

               RIGGS
     Or ÑGolly, IÒve been spotted.Ò The
     point being --

               MURTAUGH
     The point being, now she has to cover
     her ass.

               RIGGS
     Right. So she says, ÑOfficer, officer,
     I saw the whole thing.Ò

               MURTAUGH
     Right.

               RIGGS
     Right.

               MURTAUGH
          (sighs)
     ThatÒs pretty fucking thin.

               RIGGS
     Very thin.

               MURTAUGH
          (smiles)
     Hell with it. ThinÒs my middle name.

               RIGGS
     Your wifeÒs cooking, IÒm not surprised.

               MURTAUGH
     Would you lay off the cooking?

               RIGGS
     Tell her that.

Riggs steps to the line. Draws the Beretta, fires off a
full clip. Three-shot rhythms, two in the chest, one in the
head, two in the chest, one in the head. Removes the
magazines lovingly snaps in a new one.

               MURTAUGH
     You sleep with that thing under your
     pillow?

               RIGGS
     I would if I slept.

               MURTAUGH
     Here, stand back.

Murtaugh steps to the red line. Stretches. Cracks his neck.
Shifts from foot to foot. Finally steadies him- self. A
moment then: He cross-draws with lightning swiftness. --
BANG -- ! The REPORT is DEAFENING. The target grows a neat
third eye. Perfect shot. Dead center.  Murtaugh grins,
holsters his gun.

               MURTAUGH
     Hey-hey. WouldÒja look at that? Pretty
     good for an old man.

Riggs shrugs. Draws. FIRES. He isnÒt even looking.
Nonetheless. -- He puts a magnum round right through the
hole made by MurtaughÒs .38. The hole gets .60 inches
wider. Murtaugh scowls.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah, yeah.  Eat me. He stalks away,
     pissed off.

OMITTED

75     EXT. WEST L.A. STREET - MORNING                      75

MurtaughÒs car glides up to the curb. In front of a row of
neat frame houses. Old neighborhood. Late model cars. A
LITTLE black KID playing on the sidewalk. The two cops get
out, stride toward a cottage set back from the street. They
pass the Little Kid who is playing with a plastic bucket
and a headless Star Wars figure.

               RIGGS
     Hey, kid. WhatÒcha doing?

The Kid grins, obviously pleased with himself.

               LITTLE KID
     I put this on top and it fall down.

He demonstrates. He puts it on top. It falls down. He grins
happily. Riggs shakes his head.

               RIGGS
     Good thinking.

They keep walking. Toward the cottage.

               MURTAUGH
     Very thin.

               RIGGS
     Probably nothing.

They mount the steps to the walk. As they do -- The HOUSE
suddenly EXPLODES. It BLOWS  APART concussively. There is a
flash of light, a loud, flat BANG --! And the thing tears
to pieces. Glass blows out. Wood sprays. Flying shrapnel. A
wall of flame. Riggs hits the dirt, smothering the Little
black Kid. Murtaugh dives for cover behind a telephone
pole. A piece of shrapnel imbeds  itself; right next to his
head. Carnage. Noise. The tumult slowly begins to fade.
Echoes. Flames rage to the sky. Smoke rolls. Beams
collapse. The cottage is no more.  Murtaugh climbs to his
feet, dazed; stares at the rubble.  Looks over toward
Riggs, who is getting up off the Kid.  The Kid is shaken,
but unhurt.

               MURTAUGH
     Hey.

Riggs turns.

               MURTAUGH
     YouÒre on fire.

Riggs looks. The back of his coat is completely ablaze.

               RIGGS
     Shit.

He takes it off, flings it aside. Goes up to Murtaugh-
Lights a cigarette.

               RIGGS
     Probably nothing.

               MURTAUGH
     Thin.  Very thin.

EXT. BURNED-OUT COTTAGE - LATER

Cops prowl through the gutted remains. Charred and black.
Nothing left. A body goes by on a stretcher. MURTAUGH stops
it.

               MURTAUGH
     Ho.
          (he  looks  under the sheet)
     Jesus.

               ATTENDANT
     WeÒre hoping to find some teeth. in
     there. Otherwise, could be anybody.
     Black, white ... Could be a fuckinÒ
     bowl of soup, for all we --

               MURTAUGH
     Okay, okay.

The stretcher continues toward the waiting truck. Murtaugh
looks off, whispers:

               MURTAUGH
     Bye-bye


ANOTHER ANGLE

Martin Riggs is examining a twisted hunk of metal as
Murtaugh walks up beside  him.

               MURTAUGH
     What’cha got?

               RIGGS
     Part of the  device.
          (beat)
     Holy cow.

               MURTAUGH
     What?

               RIGGS
     Artwork.  This is goddamn artwork.

               MURTAUGH
     Swell.  I’m glad you liked it.

               RIGGS
     You don’t understand. This is real pro
     stuff. Haven’t seen this since ...
     well, since the war.

               MURTAUGH
     Come again?

               RIGGS
     C.I.A. used to hire mercs who used this
     same setup. Mercury switches.

Murtaugh frowns. A PATROL COP taps him on the shoulder.

               PATROL COP
     Sir, I think you’d better come with me.

Riggs-and Murtaugh exchange glances. They move off, across
the street.

EXT. STREET - BACK OF FIRE  TRUCK

Riggs and Murtaugh stand by the rear of the truck.  A
CONSTRUCTION CREW watches from behind, heavy equipment
idling softly. Next to them sits the little black kid from
earlier, coloring with crayons. His mother hovers ...

               COP
     Okay, here it is. The little  kid says
     he saw someone working on the meter
     this morning.

               MURTAUGH
     Where?

               COP
     Across the street at  Dixie’s.  He was
     playin’ some kind of game, hidin’ under
     the stairs. Says he saw the guy pretty
     good.

               MURTAUGH
     Jesus. This could be a break.

               RIGGS
     You kidding? The kid’s six years old.

               COP
     If that.

               MURTAUGH
     You call the gas company?

               COP
     Sure did. No one supposed to check that
     meter for at least another   month.

               MURTAUGH
          (nods)
     Let me handle this.

               COP
     Be my guest.

               RIGGS
     Wanna wear the chicken suit? I got some
     clown makeup.

               MURTAUGH
     Stow it.

He crosses to the boy.

               MURTAUGH
     Hi. I’m Detective Murtaugh. What’s your
     name?

               ALFRED (LITTLE KID)
     Alfred.

He stares at Murtaugh with eyes like saucers.

               MURTAUGH
     How old are you, Alfred?

               ALFRED
     Six.

               MURTAUGH
     Wow.  Six.
          (beat)
     Bet you like the Gobots, huh?

Alfred nods.

               MURTAUGH
     Me, I’m a G.I. Joe man.

               ALFRED
          (points)
     Is that a real gun?

               MURTAUGH
     Yes, it is.

               ALFRED
     Do you kill people?

               MURTAUGH
     No. If a guy is hurting someone, I try
     to shoot him in the arm or something.
     Just to stop him.

               ALFRED
     Momma says policeman shoot black
     people.

Murtaugh grimaces. Alfred’s mother looks away quickly.

               MURTAUGH
     Alfred, this man you saw. The meter man
     ... ?
          (beat)
     You get a good look at him?

               ALFRED
     I saw him.

               MURTAUGH
     Great. Listen, you ever watch ‘Starsky
     and  Hutch’?  ‘Cause  the police,
     sometimes they need help. They need
     police helpers. Detectives.
          (he  takes  out a plastic
           badge, puts it on Alfred’s
           chest)
     If you want, you can be a junior
     detective. If you want.

The kid looks at him. Distrust.

               MURTAUGH
     Keep it, it’s yours. Official
     detective.

Alfred nods, grins.

               MURTAUGH
     The man at the meter. Can you ...
     picture him in  your  head? Think about
     what he looked like. Got it ?

Alfred nods.  Murtaugh picks up Alfred’s box of crayons.
Hands it to the little boy.

               MURTAUGH
     I want you to draw him for me.

               ALFRED
     I’m a good drawer.

               MURTAUGH
     Try to draw the man.

Riggs clears his throat. Rolls his eyes.

               RIGGS
     Oh, brother. This is good. I like this.

               MURTAUGH
     Can it, Martin.

               RIGGS
     We’re gonna put out an A.P.B. on Big
     Bird.

               MURTAUGH
     Very funny.

               RIGGS
          (laughs)
     Attention all units. Large yellow bird.
     Silly voice.

               MURTAUGH
     You’re hilarious. Alfred, draw the man,
     okay?

Alfred nods, takes the crayons, and carefully selects a
bunch of colors. Lays them out like Da Vinci fixing his
palette. Riggs shakes his head.

               RIGGS
     Brilliant police work? I think so.

                                      TIME CUT:

ANOTHER ANGLE

Minutes have passed.

               MURTAUGH
     Martin, have a look at this.

Riggs crosses. Alfred has finished his drawing, and guess
what? It’s hilariously bad. Like a six-year-old drew it or
something. Riggs rubs his eyes.

               RIGGS
     Oh, my ...
          (begins to laugh)
     ... Oh, my...

He laughs even harder now.  Murtaugh scowls, snatches the
picture away.

               MURTAUGH
     Terrific. Very professional.

Riggs is hooting. Murtaugh shows the picture to Alfred.

               ALFRED
     He laugh at my picture.

               MURTAUGH
     Shhh. Don’t mind him. He’s crazy.

               ALFRED
     I’m a good drawer.

               MURTAUGH
     You bet.
          (points)
     Alfred. This is ... the man’s arm,
     right?

               ALFRED
     Yeah.

               MURTAUGH
     Okay. Now this mark. Is this ... What
     is this?

               ALFRED
     He had it on his arm.

Riggs stops laughing. Moves in closer.

               RIGGS
     Whoa. What was on his arm?

               MURTAUGH
     Was it a birthmark?
          (points to his arm)
     Was it like this?

               ALFRED
     No. It was pained.

               MURTAUGH
     Pained.

               RIGGS
     Pained, pained.  What’s he saying?

               MURTAUGH
     Sssshh.
          (beat)
     It was ... painted?

               ALFRED
     Yeah.

               MURTAUGH
     Like a tattoo?
          (beat)
     Do you watch Popeye? Was it a tattoo
     like Popeye has?

Riggs rolls up his sleeve, exposes his Marine tattoo.
You’ve seen the type: A Tweety Bird with a machine gun, or
some such.

               RIGGS
     This is a tattoo.

The boy’s eyes go wide once again. He points at Riggs’ arm.

               ALFRED
     It was that.

The cops stop, puzzled.

               MURTAUGH
     It was that? You mean...just like
     that...?

               ALFRED
     Yeah. Man had the same thing.

               RIGGS
     You’re sure?

Alfred nods. The cops exchange glances:

               RIGGS
     Special Forces tattoo ... ?

               MURTAUGH
     Martin.

               RIGGS
     Yeah.

               MURTAUGH
     What the hell are we into here ... ?

EXT. CLIFFSIDE HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling, expensive villa nestled on the side  of  a
bluff overlooking the ocean. Terraces, verandahs, gazebos.
Architecture that merits three syllables. The ocean looks
cheap by comparison. A memorial service is in progress. A
group of people, mostly young, friends of Amanda Lloyd; all
are dressed in funeral black.

NEARBY --

Martin Riggs is collapsed in a lawn chair, smoking and
looking thoroughly out of place. Seeing the girl, he frowns
... puffs on his cigarette, and rolls a quarter over his
knuckles like a stage magician. Nimble, trained fingers. A
thoroughly unconscious habit.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Dick Lloyd looks worse than ever. He stands, staring out
over the ocean -- as a hand comes out of nowhere ... grabs
his shoulder, and spins him roughly around: Face- to-face
with Roger Murtaugh. Eyes burning like cold fire.

               MURTAUGH
     Hi, guy.

               LLOYD
     Roger...What...What’s up, buddy?

               MURTAUGH
     Not much.
          (beat)
     Wanna tell me about it?

               LLOYD
     Tell you about what?

               MURTAUGH
     Don’t bullshit me. That’s over.
          (beat)
     Your daughter wasn’t killed because of
     something she was into. She was killed
     because of something you’re into.  Stop
     me if I’m wrong.

               LLOYD
     I don’t know what you’re talking about.
     Roger, I ...

               MURTAUGH
     Keep your hands in front.

               LLOYD
          (stops; startled)
     Hey. Take it easy, man.

               MURTAUGH
     Fuck easy.
          (beat)
     When you called me the other day, you
     were gonna blow the whistle, weren’t
     you?

               LLOYD
     Blow the whistle on what?

               MURTAUGH
     You tell me. You were gonna spill your
     guts. So they killed your daughter.
     Tell me I’m wrong.

Lloyd swallows hard, flustered. He can’t meet Murtaugh’s
eyes.

               MURTAUGH
     Talk to me.

               LLOYD
     Can’t ... can’t do that ...

               MURTAUGH
     They killed your daughter.

               LLOYD
     I...

               MURTAUGH
     They paid off a hooker to poison your
     daughter. Talk to me!

Lloyd shoots a desperate glance across the lawn.  At his
other daughter, Amanda’s twin.

               LLOYD
     Dammit, Roger, I’ve... I’ve got another
     daughter!

               MURTAUH
     She’ll be protected.
          (beat)
     It’s over, pal.

               LLOYD
     Protected. That’s a laugh... You don’t
     know these people.

               MURTAUGH
     Acquaint me.

                                      TIME CUT:

INT. LLOYD’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The two men are inside now. The sunlight filters in through
a large picture window from the lawn. Lloyd is pacing back
and forth. He touches his stomach in the classic gesture of
ulcer-carriers everywhere. Opens the fridge, removes a
carton of milk. There must be three cases of the stuff.
Drinks, turns to Murtaugh. A man at the end of his rope:

               LLOYD
     It goes all the way back to the war.

               MURTAUGH
     I’m listening.

               LLOYD
     I ended up working for a group called
     Air America. C.I.A. front, secretly ran
     the entire war out of Laos. I was part
     of a special unit called Shadow
     Company. Mercs. Trained killers. When
     Charley was bringing in heroin to
     finance the V.C. government, Shadow
     Company went in and burned it all down.
     We killed everybody. But we also ...
     formed a plan.

               MURTAUGH
     Keep talking.

               LLOYD
     Couple of years ago, Shadow Company got
     together again. The war was over, but
     we still had a list of sources.  In
     Asia.

               MURTAUGH
     And ... ?

               LLOYD
     And we’ve been bringing it in ever
     since.

               MURTAUGH
     Bringing what in?

               LLOYD
     Think real hard.

               MURTAUGH
     Heroin.

               LLOYD
          (nods)
     Two shipments a year. Run by ex-C.I.A.
     Soldiers, mercs. No one knows.

               MURTAUGH
     You son of a bitch.

Lloyd does not reply. A pause, then:

               MURTAUGH
     If you were getting cold feet, why’d
     they kill Amanda? Why not just kill
     you?

               LLOYD
     They can’t. They need me.

               MURTAUGH
     Why?

               LLOYD
     My bank. It’s the front. Makes
     everything look good on the tax report.

               MURTAUGH
     The tax report ... ?

               LLOYD
     This is big business, Roger.

               MURTAUGH
          (ice cold)
     Not any more. I’m gonna burn it down.

               LLOYD
     You can’t. It’s  too  big. These guys
     are trained killers.

               MURTAUGH
     Tell me about the next shipment.

               LLOYD
     No.  No way.

Murtaugh grabs a framed picture of Amanda, slams it down on
a wooden butcher block. GLASS SHATTERS. Lloyd stares.

               MURTAUGH
     Tell me!!!

Lloyd flinches.  Leans back, a dreamy look in his eyes.
Speaks from very far away ...

               LLOYD
          (softly)
     Nothing ... wrong with the kids, Roger.
     We’re all fucked up. Us old bastards
     ... We’re killing them.

And suddenly there is a gun in his hand.  Aimed at
Murtaugh.

               LLOYD
     Back off.

               MURTAUGH
     Oh, swell. Good move.

               LLOYD
     I’m not kidding. I’m in too far now.

Murtaugh does not budge. Lloyd cocks the hammer.

               LLOYD
     The gun is silenced, Roger.

Murtaugh stares him down. Eyes like fire.

               MURTAUGH
     What’s it gonna be, buddy ...? You
     gonna save my life, just so you can
     snuff me twenty years later...?

               LLOYD
     Things are different now.

               MURTAUGH
     I guess.

A moment. Lloyd stares intently. Finger sweating on the
trigger.

               MURTAUGH
     If you can do it, do it. I don’t
     fucking care anymore.

LLoyd blinks. Swallows. Another  moment. Finally -- He
lowers the gun. Sighs.

               LLOYD
     ... What do you want to know... ?

Murtaugh relaxes visibly. And that’s when two things
happen. The picture WINDOW GLASS suddenly COLLAPSES. Falls
TINKLING into a million shards. And the carton of milk in
Lloyd’s hand pops, spurting milk all over the front of his
black suit. He frowns. Stares at the dribbling milk.
Blinks. And his eyes snap open wide, as blood seeps out of
his shirt, spattering the floor.

               LLOYD
     Roger -- !

With his dying breath, he leaps in front of Murtaugh. Takes
the SECOND BULLET. The one meant for Murtaugh. It blows him
into Roger, takes them both to the floor in a breath-
crushing impact. More BULLETS CHOP thkitchen. China PLATES
BURST into a glassy spray. Food spatters and gushes,
staining the walls. Murtaugh rolls free, then, a man
possessed: Screams out the window:

               MURTAUGH
     Riggs!!!

84     EXT. LAWN                               84

Murtaugh’s voice is far away. Riggs looks up from his lawn
chair. Notices two things: One: Everything  seems normal.
Nobody has heard the  shots. Two: The glass in the kitchen
window... something strange, what the hell is it ... oh,
yeah, it’s  broken, someone broke the glass ... And Riggs
is on his feet in the blink of an eye.

BACK INSIDE

Murtaugh is at the window. Gun pointed.

               MURTAUGH
     Riggs!!!

MURTAUGH’S POV

reveals a crowd of people, milling back and forth, he has
no idea where the sniper is, and suddenly BAM -- ! The wood
blows out not two inches from his head and he ducks, and
meanwhile -- back outside ...

87     MARTIN RIGGS                                     87

He’s on the move. He jogs ... trots ... runs ...  Noticing
a lone man in black, striding quickly across the lawn,
striding into the crowd ... toward the edge of the  bluff
... Things happen fast now, pay attention, as -- The man
turns, sees Riggs ... Riggs sees him... and the man is none
other than Mr. Joshua.  Crew cut.  Sunglasses. Moving fast.

MURTAUGH

diving out the window. Hits. Rolls, comes up. Scream- ing,
waving at Riggs ...

RIGGS

Gun out ... moving fast, shoving  through the crowd,
people screaming now, “Jesus, he’s got a gun -- !” Running
across the lawn, Murtaugh thirty yards behind,  moving,
hard and fast, both guns drawn, pushing/shoving,  knocking
people ass over teacups and meanwhile let us not forget --

JOSHUA

moving at a dead run, now, gun out ... at the edge of the
cliff. People all around  him, confused, I mean Jesus, what
the hell is all this shooting about, and Riggs  can’t get a
clear shot ... He’s sweeping the gun, back and forth,
bodies crossing in front of him...all the wrong bodies,
Goddammit...!  Moving forward, shouting:

               RIGGS
     Lie down!!! Down!!!

Murtaugh, springing hell bent for leather -- and  folks,
grab your hats ... because just then, a BELL COBPA HELI-
COPTER crests the edge of the bluff. An explosion of
sound... As it rises like an avenging angel ... Hovers,
shattering the air with turbo-throb, sandblasting the
hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt, tables, chairs,
everything that’s not nailed down ... Screaming, chaos,
frenzy. Three words that apply to this scene. And in the
midst of all this -- Joshua steps onto the chopper and is
hauled inside. No expression.

The total professional. And then, my friends, it’s bye-bye
time. The CHOPPER ROARS like a behemoth, tilts -- slips
over the side and plummets away ... Slick. Very slick.
Except Martin Riggs it not impressed. He’s still running,
you see ... Dives flat at the edge of the cliff, nearly
flings himself over the damn edge ... GUN extended like
it’s part of his arm... Finger flat on the trigger
...Blowing SHOT after SHOT at the retreating chopper ...
BAM-BAM-BAM His face contorted in a rictus of animal
concentration...And he wings the chopper, even. POP spray
of fiberglass, but nossir, no cigar... cause the damn
chopper flies away. And Riggs dumps his magazine, stuffs in
a new one ... and Jesus Christ he keeps FIRING. As Murtaugh
walks up beside him. Stares down. Gun held loose at his
side. Riggs still FIRES, BAM-BAM-BAM doesn’t know it yet
... Until his MAGAZINE CLICKS empty. He lies flat. Stares.
People screaming, running away.
Murtaugh standing over him, staring down at this animal
with a gun, who even now refuses to look away from the
retreating chopper, whose gun even now continues to follow
its course out over the sea. Hands, clutching the barrel.
Finally, they relax. Riggs shuts his eyes. Murtaugh stares,
and a silent It’s over,  but  he

               MURTAUGH
     You through?

Riggs looks up at him. His eyes look like a demon’s.

               RIGGS
     I haven’t even started.

                               CUT TO:

INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

Joshua and his pilot are cruising over the surf at break-
neck speed, the rotor stirring tiny geysers of water.
Joshua speaks into a radio microphone.

               JOSHUA
     Yes, sir ... Yes, sir, Mr. Lloyd is
     dead. I’m afraid, however, that another
     problem exists.

INTERCUT - THE GENERAL

In his van, speaking on mobile phone.

               GENERAL
     Define.

               JOSHUA
     Lloyd spoke to the cops, sir.

               GENERAL
     Are the cops dead?

               JOSHUA
     No, sir. I missed.

There is a significant pause. Joshua licks his lips. Then:

               GENERAL
     That’s very disappointing. The police
     may know everything. The whole
     operation,  yes?

               JOSHUA
     Yes.  Awaiting orders, sir.

               GENERAL
     Joshua, I think it’s time to turn up
     the heat.

EXT. VIEWSITE - NIGHT

A black Camaro is parked at the side of the road. The city
twinkles beyond.

INT. CAR - SAME

Two teenagers, engaged in a first-rate makeout session. One
of them is Roger Murtaugh’s daughter Rianne. The other is
MARK, he of the hilarious dimples. They are kissing when
Rianne suddenly pulls away:

               RIANNE
     Mark, I gotta get home.

               MARK
     Would you quit worrying? Your mom
     thinks you’re asleep and your dad’s
     busy shooting crooks.

               RIANNE
     He said he’ll shoot you if we have sex.

               MARK
     Some things are worth dying for.

He leans in and kisses her. Passion, horniness. Some-
thing. He runs a hand inside her sweater. She starts to
resist. Gives in.

               RIANNE
     Wait.

She takes out her gum and sticks it to the steering wheel.
* Leans over to kiss  him  again*

94A    FACE                                   94A

comes INTO  FRAME. Right outside the window. Crewcut. *
Shirt and tie. No less than  Mr.  Joshua  himself,  as  we
--  *

                               CUT TO:

EXT. THIRD STREET - NIGHT

Martin Riggs walks slowly down the boulevard. In one hand
he carries a snapshot of Amanda Lloyd. Male prostitutes
take one look at him and flee.
He stops to light a cigarette. As he does -- He notices a
reflection in the silver lighter. Two pinpoints of light.
Moving. He throws away the cigarette. Spins, drawing his
gun.  HEADLIGHTS, as a  car comes barreling out of the
darkness. Bearing down on Riggs at fifty miles an hour.
Riggs  FIRES. The WIND-SHIELD SPLINTERS. No dice. The car
keeps coming. Riggs FIRES again, sprints for cover -- As  a
mercenary leans out of the car window with a pump SHOTGUN.
Triggers THREE BLASTS at Riggs. The first two  blow out
chunks of scenery. The third takes Riggs in the  chest.
Blows him backward through a store window. GLASS SHATTERS.
He hits the ground in a heap. The CAR SHRIEKS off into the
night, LAYING RUBBER. The ECHO of gunfire slowly FADES on
the wind...

INSIDE DARKENED STORE

Riggs lies crumpled in a pool of broken glass. Murtaugh
charges from across the street. He throws himself down
beside the dead Riggs. Rips open Riggs’ shirt revealing --
A bulletproof vest. Riggs opens his eyes.

               RIGGS
     I’m pissed, Roger.  Now I’m pissed.

EXT.  STORE

The cops exit and cross the street toward their car.

               RIGGS
     Roger. Quit looking so damn worried.
     I’m  fine.

               MURTAUGH
     Two inches higher, they would’ve got
     your head.

               RIGGS
     Fuck that. Two inches to the left, they
     would’ve got my smokes.

He takes out a pack, lights one up.

               RIGGS
     Oh, by the way: Guy who shot me?

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah.

               RIGGS
     Same guy who shot Lloyd.

               MURTAUGH
     Jesus ... You sure?

               RIGGS
     I never forget an asshole.

               MURTAUGH
          (sighs)
     So okay, ace: What do we do now?

               RIGGS
     Give up? Flee? Go far away?

               MURTAUGH
     Hilarious.  What do we really do?

               RIGGS
     What else? We bury the fuckers. You
     know, we solve this, we could get
     famous, do shaving ads and shit.

               MURTAUGH
     Do goddamn Forest Lawn ads, we’re not
     careful.

               RIGGS
     Heh. Don’t be a killjoy. It’s Friday
     night. Let’s go kick ass.

               MURTAUGH
     You just got shot, man.

               RIGGS
     Exactly.

               MURTAUGH
     What do you mean, exactly?

               RIGGS
     Gives us the edge, Cochise.
          (smiles)
     They think I’m dead, Roger. I’m a
     corpse. And  aren’t  they  just gonna
     shit when I nail their butts ... ?

They look at each other. Suddenly the police RADIO SQUAWKS.
Murtaugh answers it.

               DISPATCHER   (V.0.)
     Four King sixty, meet four king ninety
     on tach two.

               MURTAUGH
     King sixty, roger.

He adjusts the frequency on the radio.

               PATROL COP (V.0.)
     Four king ninety, four king sixty. Got
     a homicide, Mulholland Drive.

               MURTAUGH
     Four king sixty, negative.
          (beat)
     Give it to Burke.

               PATROL COP (V.0.)
     Sorry, sixty. Captain says give it to
     you. Male Caucasian, age seventeen.

               MURTAUGH
     Swell. Did he have blond hair and big
     dimples?

There is a long pause-.  Then:

               PATROL COP (V.0.)
     How’d you know... ?

Suddenly, Murtaugh goes completely pale. So does Riggs.
Murtaugh hits the gas ...

97     EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT                            97

Murtaugh’s CAR SCREECHES to the curb. Hops the sidewalk,
jolts to a stop. The two cops are out and running in a dead
heat toward the front door. Murtaugh flings open the door.
Stops. On the carpet beneath the mail slot is a tiny
envelope with SEASONS GREETINGS emblazoned across the
front. A note is attached with a paper clip. One side reads
DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH. On the other side is a message in
block capitals.

YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS REALLY PRETTY NAKED

Murtaugh tears open the envelope, afraid to breathe. Inside
is a Polaroid snapshot. The audience may get a glimpse of
it, or they may not. Either way, the effect it has on
Murtaugh is devastating. He drops the snapshot like a live
snake. Backs away, stumbles into the wall. Shakes his head.

               MURTAUGH
     Bastards ... bastards ...

Riggs looks on, stunned.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.  RINGS
again.

               RIGGS
     Roger.

Murtaugh looks up. Snaps out of  it. Down the hall, his
wife Trish moves to answer the phone.

               MURTAUGH
     Don’t answer that!!

He rushes down the hall, scoops up the receiver:

               MURTAUGH
     Murtaugh.

He listens intently, a look of pure dread on his face.
Hangs up slowly, stares straight  ahead. On the table, a
stuffed bear stares back impassively. Trish Murtaugh looks
on, terrified.

               MURTAUGH
     They took my kid... Bastards took my
     kid ...

Beside him, Riggs’ face contorts into a look of sheer,
brutal hatred ... Get ready for World War Three.

INT. MIDTOWN HOMICIDE - NIGHT

McCaskey is seated next to a bank of telephones, smoking
and reading a comic book. Behind him the fat cop we saw
earlier is conducting his choir in a thoroughly hideous
version of “Deck the Halls.” The PHONE RINGS.

               SINGING COPS
     ‘Don we now our gay apparel...’

               MCCASKEY
     McCaskey, Homicide -- just a moment,
     please -- Hey, will you guys for
     Chrissakes shut up?? ... Yes, can I
     help you?

99     INTERCUT - MCCASKEY AND MR. JOSHUA                       99

Joshua is on the other end.  Beside him the General looks
on intently.

               JOSHUA
     Hello, I’m calling from the K.T.L.A.
     News department. We heard that Sergeant
     ... um, Riggs, is it ... ? had some
     trouble tonight, and ...

               MCCASKEY
          (interrupting)
     Yes, Sergeant Riggs has been killed.
     Shot through the chest by unknown
     assailants.

               JOSHUA
     My God. I’m sorry.

               MCCASKEY
     It’s a bad day for all of us. And what
     is your name, sir?

               JOSHUA
     Goodbye.

He hangs up. Turns to the General.

               JOSHUA
     Bingo. Riggs is out of the picture.

               GENERAL
          (nods)
     I want Murtaugh taken alive.

               JOSHUA
     He may not talk.

               GENERAL
     We have his little girl.  He’ll talk.

101    INT. RIANNE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT                      *    101

Trish Murtaugh looks like she could come apart at any
* moment. She walks around the bedroom, slowly. Touching
things. Touching her daughter’s possessions. Murtaugh
enters. They look at each other. He hands her the .22.

               MURTAUGH
     Take this. Until it’s over, I don’t
     want you to let it out of your sight.

His wife nods. Runs a hand through her hair. Shifts from
one foot to the other.

               MURTAUGH
     They’re not going to hurt her. If I do
     exactly what they say... they’ll let
     her go.
          (beat)
     She’s coming home.

A moment. Then:

               TRISH
     What about you  ...  ?

Murtaugh says nothing.

INT.  LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME  TIME

Riggs has his shirt off, and is carefully removing slivers
of glass from his shoulder.  Cigarette dangling from his
lips. He hears a noise And spins, startled.

RIGGS’ POV - SIX-YEAR-OLD CARRIE MURTAUGH

Adorable in a blue nightgown, Rickles the cat cradled
lovingly in her arms. Riggs relaxes. Smiles. Carrie walks
over to him.

               RIGGS
     Hey, Missy.

               CARRIE
     I can’t sleep.

               RIGGS
     Uh-oh.  Not good.

He scoops her up.

               RIGGS
     Who’s your friend?

               CARRIE
     Rickles the cat.

               RIGGS
     Huh. He is a cutie.

Carrie looks at him then. And she does a peculiar thing.
Slowly, she reaches out ... Riggs looking on... And touches
his back.  Runs her tiny hand over the knife scar beneath
his shoulder. Fascinated by it.

               CARRIE
     Ouch.

Riggs looks at her.  Smiles, and whispers softly:

               RIGGS
     Yeah.
          (beat)
     Ouch...

And he suddenly hugs the little girl for all he’s worth.
Closes his eyes tight. In that moment, every single year
catches up to Riggs, and he looks, for a moment, incredibly
old, and so very, very tired ...

INT. LIVING ROOM  -  LATER

Carrie is asleep on the couch, snuggled beneath a knitted
afghan. Riggs and Murtaugh stand across the room, con-
ferring in hushed tones.

               RIGGS
     You know they’re going to kill her.

               MURTAUGH
     Yes.

               RIGGS
     You want her back, you’ve got to take
     her away from them.

               MURTAUGH
     I know.

               RIGGS
     Good. We do this my way.
          (beat)
     You shoot, you shoot to kill. Get as
     many as you can. Don’t miss.

               MURTAUGH
     I won’t miss.

A pause. Riggs studies Murtaugh. Then:

               RIGGS
     We’re gonna get bloody on this one.
          (beat)
     You’re going to have to trust me.

Murtaugh stares at him for a moment. Then, he finally
speaks ...

               MURTAUGH
     ... How... good are you... ?

               RIGGS
     What?

               MURTAUGH
     Are you... only crazy ... or are you...
     as good as you say you are... ?

There is a pause. Then:

               RIGGS
     No one can touch me.

               MURTAUGH
     Good. Kill every fucking one of them.
     Okay ... ?

At which point, my friends, a light flickers on behind
Riggs’ eyes. We see grim determination, sure  ... But we
also sense something else, oddly enough: Anticipation.
Riggs is a machine ... and the machine is, well ... revving
up. He looks at Murtaugh:

               RIGGS
     Get half.  I’ll kill the other half.

A moment passes between them. This will be the most
devastating night of their lives. They will probably die. A
RINGING PHONE shatters the stillness.

               RIGGS
     Here we go.

OMITTED

INT. MARTIN RIGGS’ TRAILER - DAY

The apartment is dark, illuminated only by a tiny lamp.
Riggs crosses to the window, peers out through slatted
blinds. On TELEVISION a group of carolers sings “TIDINGS OF
COMFORT AND JOY.” Riggs looks at the wall calendar:
December 22. The CLOCK TICKS. The REFRIGERATOR HUMS. He
goes to the closet. Opens it. A cloud of dust billows out.
Reaches in, removes a weathered cardboard box. Sits in the
center of the room, takes a shot of bourbon. Opens the box.
Inside is a set of desert fatigues. He takes them out.
Underneath a wicked-looking hunting knife. He takes that,
too. Holds it up near his face, and it positively sparkles
in the dim light ...

                                     TIME  CUT:

ANOTHER ANGLE

Riggs stands, fully dressed. Colt .22 in an ankle holster.
Combat webbing. Desert boots. Beretta .9 millimeter, riding
the right-hand thigh. Scans his appearance in the mirror.
Breathes:  in, out...in, out... Glances at the photograph
of his wife on the wall. Wedding gown. White lace-and-satin
ruffles. Beautiful. His face is craggy. Weathered.
Covered  with  desert paint. Surely he was never married
... not this demon...

               RIGGS
     Forgive me.

There is a KNOCK at the door. Riggs spins. Lightning quick.
Gun in hand.

               VOICE (O’s.)
     Me.  Murtaugh.

               RIGGS
     Come in slow.

The door opens and Roger Murtaugh enters, carrying a
briefcase. He looks briefly at Riggs’ combat get-up.
Shrugs. Sets the briefcase on the bed, opens it. It is
filled with round upon round of ammunition.

               MURTAUGH
     Hollow points.  Armor piercing.

               RIGGS
          (nods)
     You weren’t followed?

               MURTAUGH
     No.

Riggs begins scooping up handfuls of ammo.

INT. RIGGS’ TRAILER - FEW MINUTES LATER

Murtaugh is hooking a wire in place under his collar.

               MURTAUGH
     Testing, one, two, three...

               RIGGS
     Fine.

He straps on his hunting knife.

               RIGGS
     It’s twelve-thirty. Let’s move.

               MURTAUGH
     Don’t get too close. They’ll spot you.

Riggs hoists a long-range sniper rifle. Infra-red scope.

               RIGGS
     Thousand yards okay ... ?

EXT. LOW DESERT - DAY

The desert floor shimmers with stored heat, bathed in
relentless sunlight. A lone car, plowing along toward the
horizon. Looking lost and utterly alone beneath the clear
December sky.

INT. CAR - ROGER MURTAUGH

Driving. Relentlessly onward, his face locked in a mask of
contained fury. Dust billows past the windows. Wind. He
keeps driving, straining his eyes ahead, focusing through
the hundred-degree shimmer... Noticing, finally a series of
shapes...dim mirages... silhouettes maybe, possibly
men...possibly the men...The mirage resolves. Mercs.
Standing next to a black sedan. Murtaugh stiffens. Leans
forward, punches the cigarette lighter, and as he does --
he whispers into his hidden microphone.

               MURTAUGH
     Split.

EXT. CAR - DAY

It happens in the blink of an eye: The trunk pops open, and
out rolls Martin Riggs. Yanks a rope. The trunk slams shut.
Riggs hits. Rolls. Comes up, combat- crouched, hunkers off
at a dead heat. He is clad in his desert fatigues. Magnum
sniper rifle slung over one shoulder.

EXT. MURTAUGH - DESERT

Murtaugh rolls to a halt and steps from his car. Facing
three armed mercs. Murtaugh simply stands there, reading
the odds. Scanning ...

               MERC #1
     Murtaugh?

               MURTAUGH
     Yes.
          (beat)
     I’m alone.

               MERC  #1
     Hands up. Come with us.

               MURTAUGH
     Show me the girl.

               MERC  #1
     She’s not here.

               MURTAUGH
     Bullshit. Let me see her. Then I come
     quietly.

The Merc nods.

VAN

comes AT US from across the desert.

INT. VAN

Inside, Rianne is gagged, helpless. She looks terrified.
Next to her, Mr. Joshua holds a cocked pistol. Merc #1
leans in:

               MERC #1
     He wants to see the girl.

BACK OUTSIDE

Murtaugh waits. Sweating. Hands in pockets. And out comes
Rianne, followed by the vicious Merc. He holds a knife
squarely at her throat. Murtaugh’s eyes fill with tears.
Relief that she’s alive..

               MERC  #1
     Simple exchange. You come with us, the
     girl takes a walk.

               MURTAUGH
     Let her go now.

               MERC  #1
     No. Take your hands out of your
     pockets.

               MURTAUGH
          (shrugs)
     Sure thing, pal...

He slowly raises his hands. In his left hand, he clutches
a shiny metal sphere. A grenade. Murtaugh’s grip is the
only thing keeping it dead. The Merc swears violently.

               MURTAUGH
     This fucker’s alive.
          (beat)
     Let her go or we all die.

And that’s when Mr.Joshua steps out of the car. Deadly
calm. All heads turn.  Crewcut-Mirrored sunglasses.

               MR. JOSHUA
     Take him.

               MERC #1
     But sir ...

               MR. JOSHUA
     He’s bluffing, it’s a dud. He wouldn’t
     risk killing his daughter.

               MURTAUGH
     Don’t push me.

               MR. JOSHUA
     Take him.

EXT. HILLTOP  - MEANWHILE

Far away. The car and the surrounding figures are tiny. A
lone soldier crouches. Riggs. The rifle is on his shoulder.
His eye is glued to the scope.

117    INFRA-RED IMAGE SHOWS RIANNE AND HER CAPTOR              117

Riggs’ concentration is absolutely perfect.  Like a statue.
He licks a finger. Raises it, testing the wind.

               RIGGS
     Come on...Come on...

BACK WITH MURTAUGH

As he and Joshua stare each other down. Tense. Tense. His
hand clutches the grenade. Merc #1 pushes the knife into
Rianne’s throat.

               MERC #1
     Put the pin back in.  Do it.

Murtaugh sweats. Mr. Joshua begins to walk forward, gun
extended. Cool as ice. Another step. Smiling ...

ON  HILLTOP

Riggs sits dead still, focusing through the sniper scope.

               RIGGS
     Come on... Move away from the girl ...

MURTAUGH

Joshua stops in front of Murtaugh. Cocks the gun.

               MR. JOSHUA
     Drop the fucking grenade.

               MURTAUGH
     I do and we die.

               MR. JOSHUA
     No. I don’t think so.

He sights down the gun and pulls the trigger: All hell
breaks loose. Here’s  what  happens: BAM  --  ! The  bullet
catches Murtaugh in the shoulder. He drops the grenade. It
rolls, and Mercs dive for cover. The Merc holding Rianne
takes a step back. Bingo.

ON HILL

Riggs grunts. FIRES.

BELOW

The Merc drops. Joshua’s head snaps around. He stares off
at the distance and hisses:

               JOSHUA
     Riggs ... !

Meanwhile, Murtaugh rolls, comes  up, gun in hand.  FIRES,
BAM

               MURTAUGH
     Rianne, the car!

Rianne bolts.  Meanwhile --

ON HILLTOP

Riggs swivels the barrel, half an inch. Grunts. FIRES.

DOWN BELOW

The black sedan’s WINDSHIELD SPLINTERS.  The car rocks with
the impact as the driver is killed instantly.

GRENADE

chooses that moment to EXPLODE, poof ... into a cloud of
orange smoke. A shower of confetti.

               JOSHUA
     Dud! It’s a dud!

RIANNE

is running for the car as Joshua swivels in her  direction,
lining up the UZI, FIRING a BURST -- Until  a  bullet from
Riggs parts his hair, sends him diving to  the sand, the
Uzi sprouting flame -- As Rianne flings open the car door,
screams -- at the blood-spattered  corpse which rolls off
the steering wheel. BULLETS BLAST  the car. METAL POPS and
BURSTS. She jumps in.

MURTAUGH

is flat on the sand, FIRING like crazy, shot after shot  --
As Rianne floors the gas, the CAR PEELING out in  a’  storm
of flying sand and dirt. Door open. One leg hanging out.
Plows into an armed merc. He flies up onto the hood, spins,
still conscious, and takes aim through  the windshield,
right at her ...

ON HILL

Riggs swivels, lightning quick.

               RIGGS
     No.

Grunts. FIRES.

MERC ON HOOD

is blown off the car.

RIANNE

screams, the dead driver sprawled against one shoulder, her
foot nailed to the gas pedal ... as the car leaps like a
kicked dog and careens off into the desert.

ON  HILLTOP

Riggs lines up for another shot -- And there is a soft
CLICK -- ! He  whirls. The General has arrived. Stand- ing
at the top of the hill. His M-16 is cocked and locked.

               GENERAL
     You’re not that fast, son.
          (beat)
     Drop the rifle.

He speaks into a walkie-talkie.

               GENERAL
     I got Riggs.

ON DESERT FLOOR

Murtaugh makes a break for it, FIRING blind -- Until the
ground before him literally EXPLODES with GUNFIRE. The
earth is chopped to tatters. Dirt flies. He stops. Puffing
for breath. Raises his hands. As the smoke clears, Mr.
Joshua approaches like a demon through fog. He is flanked
by two mercs with Uzis-

               JOSHUA
     A very nice try.
          (speaks into walkie-talkie)
     Kendo. Get the girl.

ON  HILLTOP

Riggs stands, hands over head. The General studies him
thoughtfully.

               GENERAL
     Martin Riggs. Your combat record is the
     stuff of legend.

               RIGGS
     So is yours. General Peter McAllister,
     commander of Shadow Company.

               GENERAL
     I see we’ve heard of each other.

               RIGGS
     Yeah. It’ll almost be a shame when I
     kill you.

               GENERAL
          (laughs)
     I don’t think so, son.

DESERT FLOOR

Mr. Joshua says to Murtaugh:

               MR. JOSHUA
     You’re about to have a fun evening.

               MURTAUGH
     Go spit.

Joshua slams him in the head with a karate blow.  He falls.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

Rianne is driving to save her life. Screaming at the top of
her lungs, the needle touching 90 as she struggles to shove
the merc’s dead body into the corner. Swerving.  Screaming.
At which point the sand explodes in front of her. She
shrieks. A HOWL of noise, a veritable eruption  of sand and
dirt, and it’s one of two things, it’s  either aliens from
space, descending -- or it’s a Bell  Cobra helicopter.
Rianne swerves to a halt to avoid the  DRONING CHOPPER,
which hovers like a behemoth, ROTORS THROBBING, as Rianne
stumbles from the car and collapses in a heap on the sand.
Lost, alone, her tears inaudible  over the HIGH, CHURNING
WHINE as we

                                      FADE OUT.

                              FADE IN:

INT. BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Riggs is naked. He is manacled hand and foot. Chained in a
bathtub full of water. Around him is a dingy concrete
basement. Joshua steps forward. Behind him is KENDO, an
Oriental mercenary. He is working on a mechanical device of
some kind. Connecting wires. Riggs grunts.

               JOSHUA
     Well, well. Look who’s back from the
     dead.

Riggs struggles against the manacles, slopping water.

               JOSHUA
     Please save your strength. I believe
     you’ll need it.

Riggs stops moving. Scowls at Joshua and says nothing.
Joshua smiles.

               JOSHUA
     You’re just in time for a lot of pain.

               RIGGS
     I’m thrilled.

               JOSHUA
     Oh, you will be.  I daresay you’ll be
     ... shocked.

Kendo snickers in the corner.

               RIGGS
     Who’s the chin?

               JOSHUA
     Shhh. Don’t make him mad.

               RIGGS
     My mistake. Who’s the pleasant Oriental
     psychopath?

               JOSHUA
     His name is Kendo, and he has forgotten
     more about dispensing pain than you
     will ever know.

               RIGGS
     Terrific. Listen, guys, can we get some
     Mister Bubble in here ...

               JOSHUA
     Please shut up.
          (studies Riggs)
     My, my, look at all those scars.
          (beat)
     See, Martin, we have a problem. Since
     we have Murtaugh, we really don’t even
     need you.  But I believe in being
     thorough.

Across the room, Kendo throws a switch. A mechanical
HUMMING fills the room.

               JOSHUA
     Our problem -- and yours, too is that
     we have some merchandise to deliver.  A
     rather large shipment, we’re all very
     excited.  It would be unfortunate,
     however, if we showed up with the goods
     and found ourselves surrounded by fifty
     cops.

               RIGGS
     That would be a shame.

               JOSHUA
     Indeed. So you see, Martin, it is
     essential that we find out how much the
     police know.

               RIGGS
     We don’t know shit. You killed Lloyd
     before he could talk.

               JOSHUA
     I wish I could believe you.
     Unfortunately, I don’t. So, if you’ll
     be kind enough to tell us all you know,
     I will kill you quickly.

               RIGGS
     Such a deal, I should  worry.

               JOSHUA
     Oh, indeed you should.  See, Martin,
     you don’t talk to us ...

He gestures to Kendo, who approaches. He is carrying a very
ominous device: a sponge, attached to a portable dry-cell
battery casing ... Joshua frowns at Riggs.

               JOSHUA
     Do you vomit?

               RIGGS
     Sometimes.

Joshua nods. Sighs.

               JOSHUA
     Back before prison reform, the staff at
     Sing Sing invented a rather unusual
     form of punishment. It’s know as the
     hummingbird treatment. Are you
     familiar?

               RIGGS
     Please, no tickling. I hate tickling.

               JOSHUA
     The ‘patient’ is chained naked in a
     bathtub full of water. A bath is then
     administered using a battery powered
     sponge. The pain is said to be so
     excruciating that after twenty minutes
     most men are either insane or dead.

Riggs is silent.

               JOSHUA
     I thought you’d  like it. I can of
     course, kill you now. Simply tell me
     what you know.

               RIGGS
     Guess we’re in for a long night. ‘Cause
     I don’t know scratch.

               JOSHUA
     We’ll find out. Kendo ... ?

The Oriental moves forward. He brandishes the sponge/
battery hookup. Dips it into a bucket of water. Riggs is
sweating.

               JOSHUA
     Feel free to  scream.

               RIGGS
     Haven’t you guys...heard of yuletide
     cheer...?

Kendo hits Riggs with the sponge. Riggs screams. A high,
lunatic scream. Thrashes in the water, splashing Kendo,
whipping from side to side as the room spirals back and
forth out of focus. Kids, don’t try this at home. Kendo
removes the device. Riggs falls backward. Thumps against
the tub. Sucking air. Moaning.

               JOSHUA
     My goodness.  Now that was fun, wasn’t
     it?

Riggs looks at him. Dripping hate.

               RIGGS
     I’m going to kill both of you.

               JOSHUA
          (laughs)
     That’s very funny.
          (beat)
     About the shipment ... ?

               RIGGS
     Fuck yourself.

Kendo dunks the battery..Run it down Riggs’ stomach. He
screams again, as we mercifully ...

INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME

No windows. Hardwood floors. A single chair in the center
of the room. Roger Murtaugh is strapped tightly to the
chair. His face looks like something his wife makes for
dinner. Black eyes. Swollen jaw. His shirt is off, exposing
the gunshot wound in his arm.
The General stands facing him, flanked by three mercs.
They all wear holstered sidearms.

               GENERAL
     The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh?

               MURTAUGH
     Go spit.

               GENERAL
          (sighs)
     I hope you enjoy saying that as much as
     Mr. Larch enjoys punishing you for it.

MR. LARCH, a big redneck with no discernible compassion,
steps forward. Pours a big handful of baking salt from a
container. Packs it into Roger Murtaugh’s gunshot wound.
Murtaugh groans. Shouts. Struggles. The General looks on
without blinking.

               MURTAUGH
     That’s it...if you guys think I’m
     sending you a Christmas card you’re
     nuts.

Larch cuffs him, hard.

               GENERAL
          (shakes his) head)
     This is going nowhere. Mr. Larch...?

Larch grins, leaves the room. A pause. Murtaugh sweats,
glaring out from swollen eyelids. The General nods, smiles.

INT. BASEMENT  -  BACK  WITH  RIGGS

as he groans and collapse back into the tub. Splash. Moans
feebly. Blood drips from his nose. Saliva drools from his
limp mouth. He looks half-dead, probably be- cause he is
just that. Kendo pulls away the battery sponge, says to
Joshua:

               KENDO
     He knows shit. We’re safe.

               JOSHUA
     You’re sure?

               KENDO
     Believe me, he’d have told us.

               JOSHUA
     Fine.
          (clucks in disgust)
     Big, bad soldier ... my ass.
          (beat)
     I’m going upstairs. Deal with him.

               KENDO
     Deal with him?

               JOSHUA
     Yeah.
          (stops at the door)
     Fry his nuts.

He exits.

                               CUT TO:

INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - SAME TIME

The General leans over Murtaugh. Murtaugh sweats.

               GENERAL
     Anytime, Roger. Anytime.
          (beat)
     See, the thing of it is...We know where
     you live.
          (frowns)
     In fact, Mr. Joshua has been known to
     exterminate entire families, when he
     gets in... one of his moods. Oh,
     speaking of that --

Larch re-enters the dingy back room. This time he’s got
Murtaugh’s daughter Rianne. She is clad only in a T-shirt
and bikini briefs.

               RIANNE
     Daddy ... please don’t let them hurt me
     ... !

Murtaugh goes nuts. Struggles, wrenches, bangs the chair up
and down against the floor. No use. He is completely
helpless.  Snarls with rage:

               MURTAUGH
     Bastards ... Untie me and I’ll kill
     every one of you.

               GENERAL
     Precisely why we would never think of
     untying you.

Larch shoves Rianne into the corner. She lands in a heap.
Murtaugh is sweating buckets. Eyes desperate. The General
leans in close:

               GENEPAL
     If you know something, son, you better
     play ball, ‘cause the stakes just went
     up ...

INT. BASEMENT - SAME TIME

Kendo switches on the battery again. In the tub, Riggs’
head lolls back and forth. Listless. Dead. His eyes refuse
to focus. Kendo shows him the sponge.

               RIGGS
          (slurred)
     No ... Please ...

               KENDO
     You die now, Sergeant Riggs. Very slow.

Riggs does not respond. Stares into space. Kendo leans over
the tub, reaches in -- And that’s when we find out Riggs
has been faking. His eyes focus. No longer hazed. He snaps
his hand forward to the end of the chain. Grabs Kendo by
the  hair. In the blink of an eye, he slams the man’s head
down against the porcelain tub. Kendo’s nose shatters. The
Oriental topples over into the tub. The battery drops to
the floor. Riggs is a fucking machine: he flips the chain
around Kendo’s neck and wrenches. Hard. He goes limp. Riggs
is not through yet. He begins to heave and thrash,
thrusting against the chains -- Maneuvering the corpse on
top of him. Shifting it. Moving Kendo’s pants pocket within
reach. He reaches in. Slowly, carefully, brings out a shiny
silver key ...

INT. DINGY BACK ROOM --  SAME TIME

A length of rope is pulled taut. RIANNE’s bound hands are
stretched over her head. Larch hooks the rope around a peg
set into the wall. She is helpless. Murtaugh is out  of his
mind. Struggling to break free.

               GENERAL
     Good Lord. Very wholesome-looking girl.
     Yessirreee.

               MURTAUGH
     Goddammit, I’ve told you everything!!!!

               GENERAL
     We’ll soon know, won’t we?

Larch approaches Rianne. She squirms.

               MURTAUGH
          (beat)
     You touch her, you’re dead.

               GENERAL
     Oh, son, spare me.
          (beat)
     It’s over, Sergeant. No heroes around
     to save you ...

He picks up a baseball bat. Tosses it to Larch.

               GENERAL
     Mr. Larch... She’s yours.

Rianne  screams. Murtaugh  shouts. Strains. The chair
thumps up and down, creating an insane, staccato rhythm.
The General laughs. Rianne shrieks. Harrowing. Terri- ble.
A scene out of Hell. And then the Devil comes in and kicks
the door off its hinges. Okay. Okay. Let’s stop for a
moment. First off, to describe fully the mayhem which Riggs
now creates would not do it justice. Here, however, are a
few pointers: He is not flashy. He is not Chuck Norris.
Rather, he is like a sledge-hammer hitting an egg. He does
not knock people down. He does not injure  them. He simply
kills them. The whole room. Everyone   standing. Except for-
-the General, who ducks out a side door and escapes ...
Riggs’ chain moves like a live thing. Snapping here.
Striking there. Mercs try to draw  their guns -- And
suddenly their hands are shattered wrecks. One merc draws a
bead on Rianne, almost gets off  a shot, because Riggs is
across the room. Without missing a beat -- Riggs throws the
chain. It wraps the guy’s  neck and kills him instantly.
Ouch ... He goes down,  FIRING useless ROUNDS into the
ceiling. Plaster rains.  Riggs spins, dives. Scoops up the
baseball bat. Comes up beside an armed merc -- Swings the
bat with hurricane force. A sickening impact. The bat
breaks in half. Riggs spins, combat-ready. Scans the room.
No one left to kill. Using only the element of surprise, he
has taken out an entire room in hand-to-hand combat. He
steps in front of Murtaugh without missing a beat. Cuts him
loose with  a  borrowed  knife.

               RIGGS
     Work your circulation.

Crosses to Rianne, cuts her free. She collapses sobbing
into his arms.

               RIGGS
     Ssshhh- No time.  Come on.

He scoops up handguns, throws them to Murtaugh. Takes for
himself a pump shotgun, possibly the same one used against
him earlier. Murtaugh stares dumbfounded at the body count.

               RIGGS
     They’re all dead. Let’s get out of
     here.

143    EXT. HALLWAY -  SAME  TIME                           143

The three of them. On the run, moving hard and  fast.  They
scramble down the hallway, Riggs in the lead, as -- a merc
ducks around the corner, sees them. Ducks back.  Riggs
FIRES through the wall, BLAM -- ! A corpse falls into view.
They keep moving. Downstairs. Around another corner.
Moving, moving. The three of them keep moving.  Rushing
headlong toward a sign marked EXIT. They may actually make
it...Or  not. For at that moment, Mr. Joshua looms  up
behind  them and tosses something in their direction. Ducks
back out of sight. It’s a live  grenade. The grenade hits
the floor. Clatters.  Riggs stops instantly. He knows the
sound. Spins. Dives. Scoops up the GRENDADE and chucks it
with all his might. It bounces downstairs and EXPLODES at
the foot of the steps.

EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Joshua skids to a halt next to a sedan. He slams the door
and ROARS off down Hollywood Boulevard. The crowd parts
like the Red Sea. People are screaming. And suddenly, the
doors burst open--As Riggs, Murtaugh and Rianne come
skidding out onto the sidewalk in hot pursuit. Murtaugh
shoves his daughter back as Joshua FIRES out the window of
the car. BULLETS lash the pavement. The crowd shrieks.  The
CAR SCREECHES away.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A beat cop comes running up, and  Murtaugh  shoves  Rianne
in his direction. Flashes his badge.

               MURTAUGH
     Get her out of here.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MURTAUGH AND RIGGS

go running after the car. Side by side. Beaten. Bloody.
Naked from the waist up. Murtaugh FIRING his PISTOL.  Shot
after blazing shot. Riggs unloading with the M-16 on three-
shot mode, the muzzle flash blinding, the noise DEAFENING--
Until pedestrians swarm suddenly into the line of fire.
Blocking them. Except Murtaugh won’t give up.  He runs
after the car, shouting:

               MURTAUGH
     Out of the way.  Move.

His GUN CLICKS empty. He tosses it aside. Pulls another
from his waistband. The car. Far away. FIRES FOUR more
SHOTS. Collapses in the street. Nearly’ unconscious. Crawls
forward after the car, blood streaming  from  his broken
nose...Going on sheer guts. Finally gives out. Slumps in a
heap. Riggs kneels beside him as a police  CAR ROARS up to
them, flashers  spinning. Riggs is a man  possessed. We
PANA-GLIDE with him as he runs forward.  M-16 in one hand.
Badge in the other.

               RIGGS
     Get an ambulance!!

He takes off after the Joshua’s car. On foot. Someone
better tell this guy to lighten up. The car is far ahead,
racing onto a freeway on-ramp. Riggs runs. Sweat pours off
him. Seeing the car on the ramp, he changes direction.
Starts running an intercept course. Leaps out  into the
street--Spins, as a TRUCK BLARES out of  nowhere, BRAKES
SQUEALING, HORN SHRIEKING. Somersaults  over the
hood.Lands. Keeps moving. Barrels across the  street.
Faster now. Even faster than before. Feet pounding. Gun
swinging. Dashing out onto the freeway  overpass. Where,
without stopping, he promptly jumps the  guardrail. Drops
through space ... And lands, thump -- !  Atop the big green
freeway sign. Swings like an acrobat.  Dangles from the
sign, twenty feet above the ground.  Levels the M-16 one-
handed, switches it to full auto.  Waits ...

147    BENEATH HIM                                     147

Joshua’s CAR comes SCREAMING through the underpass,  doing
eighty. Riggs unleashes the GUN. It BLAZES  with  cruel
FIRE. STRAFES the back of the car. Sure enough,  BLOWS out
both TIRES -- Throwing the VEHICLE into a  deadly SKID--
Slewing across the freeway--STRIKING the  GUARDRAIL at
sixty-plus. It slides for a full hundred  yards, sending up
a shower of sparks. The back tires  disintegrate in a trail
of burning rubber.  The CAR GRINDS to a halt. The door
opens  and  Joshua  rolls out. Riggs FIRES. Kicks up a
cloud of cement near  the merc. Joshua RETURNS  FIRE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Big chunks of the.freeway SIGN BLOW OUT next to Riggs’
head. He is showered with wooden debris. Riggs lowers the
gun. Lets go and drops twenty feet to the pavement.  Lands,
rolls, comes up. A CAR swerves around him.  CRASHES into
the guardrail. Riggs doesn’t even look.  Instead, he begins
to walk. He is a fucking juggernaut.

UP AHEAD

Joshua turns, sees Riggs--and stops.

               JOSHUA
     Okay, you bastard, let’s see who’s
     better.

They are separated by perhaps two hundred yards. Joshua
snaps his rifle to his shoulder. Eyes glued to the  scope.
Riggs swings his own rifle into position -- and  we’ve got
the showdown at the O.K. Corral. A battle of  wits. Each
one scanning through the scope. Looking for a clear shot,
as CARS SWERVE around and between them. The crosshairs
sweep the freeway. Perfect concentration.  Riggs. Joshua.
Two soldiers. And suddenly, the shot is there: Joshua
sights in on Riggs’ position. Only problem is, Riggs’ rifle
is pointed  right at the CAMERA. He is sighted in on
Joshua. Simultaneous. They FIRE at the exact same moment.
TWO SHOTS. Two distinct RIFLE CRACKS.  Riggs takes it in
the shoulder. Blown backward. Joshua goes down, winged.
Riggs. Joshua. Each looks like shit.  They struggle to
their feet ... And that’s when a car backs up into Riggs at
thirty miles an hour. Broadsides  him. Sends him flying.

UP AHEAD

Joshua rushes up to a stalled car. Throws open the door.
Yanks out the driver, hops behind the wheel. ROARS away.

                               CUT TO:

EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME

An ambulance shudders to a halt and two ORDERLIES hop out.
Uniformed COPS are struggling to hold back the crowd. One
of the Orderlies rushes up.

               ORDERLY
     Where is he, Officer?

               COP
     Right over there.

He points -- and suddenly frowns: There is no one there.
Murtaugh is gone. Nowhere to be seen.

                               CUT TO:

EXT. BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME

A sleek black VAN careens around the corner.

INT. VAN

A MERC is driving, foot glued to the pedal. THE GENERAL
sits sweating in the back seat.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The headlights flash wildly as the car roars down the
alley. The General stares ahead, and suddenly ------- ...
‘Cause wouldn’t you know it, there’s ROGER MURTAUGH. Fifty
yards away. Standing in the middle of the street.

ANOTHER ANGLE

There is no reason for Murtaugh to be standing. He is a
walking testament to man’s ability to bloody himself. And
he’s pissed... The Merc sees him, snarls-- punches the gas.
Murtaugh holds his ground. He can barely stand. And then he
does a peculiar thing: He examines his hand. No question. A
definite tremble. Scowls. Stretches. Cracks his neck.
Shifts from foot to foot, steadying himself.  He has one
shot. The numbers are falling, it’s all  coming down  --
And he’s ready. The van comes barreling in. Doing fifty.
Now or never...

               MURTAUGH
     No way you live.  No way.

He cross-draws with lightning swiftness. BAM. The REPORT is
DEAFENING. The WINDSHIELD promptly SHATTERS. And the Merc
sprouts a neat third eye. Perfect shot. Dead center.  The
van swerves. Murtaugh steps out of the way. Deadly calm. As
the van careens past -- He salutes the General.  Watches,
expressionless...The CAR SLAMS into a telephone pole and
rolls over. GRINDING METAL. An ERUPTION of GLASS. It
continues to roll like some great beast, crumpling and
folding  like  an  accordion... Comes to rest, upside down
in a sea of glass ...

INT. VAN

The General is pinned beneath a crumpled door-frame,
struggling to break free, as FLAMES lick upward from the
ruptured gas tank... And then the General sees something
which ruins his whole day. The Merc’s corpse, sprawled
over the  steering  column...*with a shiny metal GRENADE
attached to his belt.*Flames dance around the grenade*

153C   ANOTHER ANGLE                                 *    153C

The General squirms, strains, yanks for all he’s worth...
*Fingers reaching out for the grenade....................
*Flames burning his outstretched hand....................
And it is, as they say, all she wrote.*

EXT. ROADWAY

Murtaugh is walking like a zombie. Away from the VAN. Gun
held loosely at his side. Suddenly--It BLOWS sky high. A
tower of fire. Blows Murtaugh flat. Knocks him ass over
teacups. ECHOES down the street. Turns night into day for
one brief instant. And  then--Then something truly
incredible happens. For the first time in nearly a century--
it begins to snow in Hollywood. Murtaugh looks up, a “What
the hell ... ?” expression on his face. Sure enough --

HEROIN

is sifting down on the night air, ten million dollars’
worth... A cloud over the entire’ street. Swirling in the
breeze.

MURTAUGH

gets slowly to his feet, checking for broken bones. If it
wasn’t busted already, apparently it’s okay now. Time
passes. A hand rests on his shoulder.

MARTIN RIGGS

Stands next to him. Cops swarm behind them. The heroin snow
continues to fall. The wreck burns. Riggs looks at
Murtaugh. Murtaugh looks at Riggs. The two most physi-
cally abused men in film history.

               MURTAUGH
     Well, shit.

               RIGGS
     Try not to breathe, you’ll see pink
     elephants.

               MURTAUGH
     Joshua?

               RIGGS
     Got away.

               MURTAUGH
     We ... gotta find him.

               RIGGS
     No dice. First thing we gotta do is get
     you to a hospital.

               MURTAUGH
     Uh-huh First thing we gotta do is check
     on my house.
          (beat)
     I got a bad feeling...

He moves away. Riggs starts to follow. Goes to toss his
cigarette in the gutter, and stops: There is a tiny, red
mark at the tip of the filter: It is the cigarette. The
very last one ... He stares at it, a sudden glimmer in his
eye.

                               CUT TO:

EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

The Christmas lights shed a happy glow.  The lawn is still
littered with toys. Two uniformed COPS are watch- ing over
the house, sitting in a police car across the street. One
of them munches on a sandwich. The other is doing a
crossword puzzle. A car pulls up next to them.  The door
opens--out steps Mr. Joshua.

               POLICE OFFICER
     Excuse me, sir, may I see some
     ID?

Joshua takes an UZI from beneath his coat. No hesi- tation.
BLOWS them apart. Walks forward, gun smoking. Crosses the
lawn to the front door. Kicks it to splinters.

EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME

A police CAR PEELS around the corner. Takes out a Salvation
Army BUCKET, which POPS like a clay duck. Coins shower
every which way.

INT. CAR

Murtaugh is driving like a lunatic. Beside him, Riggs holds
a handkerchief to his gunshot wound.

INT. MURTAUGH HOME’- SAME TIME

Joshua stalks down the hallway of Murtaugh’s house. Stops
in front of the bedroom door. Holy Jesus ...He kicks it
open. SPPAYS the interior with GUNFIRE. Shreds the
mattress, dices the pillows. Trashes everything in sight:
Star Wars posters. Stuffed animals. Stereo. Empties an
entire clip of .9 millimeter slugs. Except the bed is
empty. There is no one there. Joshua snarls. Turns.

SERIES OF SHOTS

Kicks open another door. TRIGGERS DESTRUCTION. Plaster and
wood fill the air in a cloud. Room to room. Search- ing.
Growing more and more enraged--because there is no one here
to kill. He is blowing the shit out of an empty Santa
Monica bungalow. He bursts into the only room he hasn’t
visited. Living room. It too, is empty. There is a note,
however. Taped to the Christmas tree: Big letters.

DEAR BADGUYS

NO ONE HERE BUT US COPS.

SORRY.

-- THE GOODGUYS

Joshua swears. Runs for the  door. And a police CAR drives
through the front of the house. PLOWS into the living room,
shearing boards in half, BURSTING WINDOWS, GRINDING to a
halt in a sea of glass. Joshua  spins, triggering the UZI.-
STRAFES the car. A withering FIRE. Empties an entire clip
at the front WINDSHIELD, dicing it to SMITHEREENS. Waves
the gun like a WAND, STRAFING X patterns, FIRING all the
while, completely EXTINGUISH- ING the car and all life
within. Stops. Silence. Floating debris. Joshua lowers the
gun. Breathing hard. Crosses  the room, his boots crunching
through broken glass.   Yanks on the driver’s door. It
falls loose with a metal  clang.

163    ANOTHER  ANGLE                                      163

A cop’s nightstick has been jammed against the accel-
erator pedal. The car is empty. Joshua spins, startled
Stares across the room At MARTIN RIGGS, who sits calmly  on
the windowsill.

               RIGGS
     Ho, ho, ho.

He raises his gun and fires without blinking. Blows the gun
out of Joshua’s hands. Smiles a big shit-eating grin.
Joshua turns and dives through the hole in the wall, lands
outside, comes up running, but sorry, no dice because there
stands Roger Murtaugh. Drawing a bead on Joshua’s running
figure.

               MURTAUGH
     Freeze, Joshua.

Joshua stops dead. Turns, growling low in his throat. A
fire hydrant, sheared off by the runaway car, sprays water
high into the nighttime air. The wind blows. Martin Riggs
steps out of the house. Pointing the .38 Special like a
finger of doom. Strolls toward Mr. Joshua...
the gun is rock steady. Riggs’ eyes meet Murtaugh’s, and he
speaks with deadly purpose:

               RIGGS
     I’ll handle it.

He steps up to Joshua. Smiles. And then he does some- thing
very strange: he relaxes his  grip on the gun--And throws
it away. Faces Joshua. Raises his arms, and carefully
places them behind his head. When he speaks, his voice
drips menace:

               RIGGS
     Come on, ace.
          (beat)
     Try me.

A moment. Then Joshua calmly plants himself in front of
Riggs. Around them, water showers down in a gentle cloud.
SIRENS APPROACH in the near distance. Joshua and Riggs. Two
soldiers. Their eyes lock. And you better hang onto your
popcorn, boys and girls, because it’s  about  to  get ugly.

               JOSHUA
     Don’t mind if I do.

And so it begins. They start to circle. Riggs and Joshua,
perfect concentration, round and round and never, never
once does their focus break, because, baby, these guys are
pros -- And  here’s something funny: they aren’t looking at
each other’s eyes at all. Rather -- They’re watching each
other’s hands.

RIGGS

His fingers twitch. Flex. Wrist making  slow, laborious-
circles.

JOSHUA

Shifting from leg to leg, floating his balance.

MURTAUGH

looks on, sweating it out. He’s not happy, he wants to end
it ... And yet he waits.

RIGGS AND JOSHUA

All we see is their eyes, straining, focusing, scanning for
an opening.

               JOSHUA
     Concentrate, Martin...Don’t give me an
     opening..Wouldn’t want to do that ...

Riggs shifts. Blinks. And:

JOSHUA

springs ... Foot coming out like a shot, Riggs jerking
back, inches -- meanwhile, Riggs -- countermove, spins,
tries a back kick, no dice ... Joshua no longer there,
where is he ... ? Shit --! Comes up, darts a punch to
Riggs’ neck -- Riggs fields it, snap the left.  It comes
out of nowhere.



CRACK! The sound of Riggs’ rib breaking carries clearly. He
grunts. Thrusts, inviting a countermove ... Joshua counters
-- And Riggs snags his hand, picture-fucking- perfect.
Breaks one of Joshua’s fingers. Ouch. Backs off.  Joshua
backs off. The two of them. Wounded, they circle.  Round
two ...

MURTAUGH

Meanwhile, is raising his gun, pointing it at Joshua.
Riggs’ voice cuts like a knife:

               RIGGS
     No. Roger.
          (beat)
     No way.

Murtaugh lowers the gun. Stares, fascinated, at this
contest between two consummate professionals. In for the
kill. It is a dance of the forces. Riggs is on fire. Leaps,
avoiding a shot to the knee, spins, slams the knuckles of
his hand into Joshua’s nose. Busts it. Joshua snarls, drops
-- Catches Riggs’ arm over one shoulder. And, ladies and
gentlemen... Riggs has just fucked up. CRACK -- ! His arm
breaks. He screams with pain. Screams with anger. Tosses
three shots at Joshua. SNAP. SNAP. SNAP. RIBS, SPLINTERING.
Joshua hissing with pain. Lets go. Back off (Riggs). Back
off (Joshua). In pain, they circle. Round three ...

               JOSHUA
     That’s it, Martin... your body wants to
     go into shock... but you won’t let it,
     will you ... ?

               RIGGS
     ...  Give it up ... Your breathing’s
     shot  ...

               JOSHUA
     so’s your left arm...

               RIGGS
     Life’s tough that way ... Oh, by the
     way: Fuck you.

He launches himself at Joshua. Joshua strikes, scores a
minor point, breaking Riggs’ collarbone, except Riggs
doesn’t care,nosirree Bob... ‘Cause he just hit paydirt:
Joshua’s knee. Boot-strikes, BAM -- ! Shearing the knee,
maybe bursting the cap ... Joshua shrieks, but then again,
so would you. And he promptly jack-knives his fist right
into Riggs’ broken arm. Three times. Riggs bellows.
Refuses to quit. Slams his head into Joshua’s busted nose.
Pop ... Does it again. Joshua, hammering the  broken arm.
Pow.(Scream) Pow.(Scream) ... Until, son of a bitch... The
pain is simply too intense... nothing human can withstand
it, they fall away, staggering, wrenching to a shaky halt,
facing one another, standoff ... Exhausted, limping, hardly
able to speak...

POLICE CARS

Pulling up now, cops stumbling out, guns clearing  their
holsters as Murtaugh waves frantically, screams:

               MURTAUGH
     No guns. Let it go! Goddammit, let it
     go!!

RIGGS

spits, gazes straight at Joshua. Joshua stares back. Two
soldiers. This close to collapsing. Until, breaking the
silence -- comes Murtaugh’s voice:

               MURTAUGH
     Martin.

               RIGGS
     Yeah.

               MURTAUGH
     Kill the motherfucker.

A moment...and then, my friends, Riggs does a peculiar
thing: He smiles then. Damned if he doesn’t. And rises up
... Standing. Standing straight.
There is no way he should be able to do this. And then he
speaks, and it’s like the voice of doom, and all of a
sudden we know that this guy is a fucking legend, we know
why the V.C. en- forcers whispered his name at night in the
foxholes ... He is Riggs. And no one can touch him. No one.

               RIGGS
     Last chance. Walk away.

               JOSHUA
     Fuck yourself.

               RIGGS
     Fine. Die.

He steps forward. Stands. Joshua springs -- thunders his
foot into Riggs’ hip, separating the bone at the joint ...
And Riggs doesn’t blink. His hand comes out. Lightning
quick. There is a sick-sounding CRACK -- And Joshua is dead
before he hits the ground. Riggs hovers over the corpse...
breathing spastic, saliva dripping from his lips... takes a
handkerchief, wipes his hand, and says:

               RIGGS
     You lose.

At which point, he collapses like a sack of grain.

MURTAUGH

is running forward, tears in his eyes by this time, falls
to his knees, cradling Riggs in his arms, while the
assembled cops look on in thoroughly stunned silence, what
they have just seen is beyond their wildest imagining ...

ON GROUND

Riggs looks at Murtaugh. Murtaugh looks at Riggs.

               MURTAUGH
     Take it easy, Martin...

               RIGGS
     ... Right. Easy. You bet ...

               MURTAUGH
     Does it hurt ... ?

Riggs throws him a look.

               RIGGS
     What are you, an idiot?

               MURTAUGH
     Sorry.

               RIGGS
     S’all right.
          (beat)
     I got good news and bad news.

               MURTAUGH
     What’s the good news?

               RIGGS
     ... Good news is, I’m not dead...

               MURTAUGH
     What’s the bad news?

Riggs grimaces in pain-

               RIGGS
     ... Bad news is, I’m still alive ...

He chuckles. Groans. Passes out. The water RAINS steadily
down. The night wears on...

                               CUT TO:

EXT. LONG BEACH BAR - DAY

Christmas carolers sing outside at roadside. A big banner
screams MERRY CHRISTMAS to passing cars. Christmas lights.
Tinsel. Murtaugh and Riggs stand on the sidewalk, huddled
against the chill. Riggs stands, braced on one crutch. Arm
in a sling. Their breath plumes out in front of them.

               MURTAUGH
     So.

               RIGGS
     So.

               MURTAUGH
     There are worse things than a psych
     pension.

               RIGGS
          (shrugs)
     Probably.

               MURTAUGH
     Guess I won’t be seeing you around.

               RIGGS
     Guess not.
          (beat)
     The Department thinks I’m wild. I don’t
     belong anymore. Not here.

               MURTAUGH
     Where do you belong?

               RIGGS
     Who knows ... ? Maybe I can get a job
     on a remake of Cobra.

               MURTAUGH
     My son would come see you.

               RIGGS
     He’d be the only one.

               MURTAUGH
          (a pause; then)
     Riggs.

               RIGGS
     Yeah.

               MURTAUGH
     This ... is a bad old world, isn’t it?

               RIGGS
          (sighs)
     Yeah. Sometimes it really is.

               MURTAUGH
     Hell.
          (beat)
     I’m thinking of quitting.

               RIGGS
     Don’t you dare.

Murtaugh looks at him.

               RIGGS
     You’re too old to change now, Colchise.

               MURTAUGH
     Me? Old...?

               RIGGS
     You just hang in there.

               MURTAUGH
     Yeah. You, too.

               RIGGS
     Guess I’ll say goodbye.

               MURTAUGH
     Sure. Come over for dinner sometime.

               RIGGS
     No, thanks.

               MURTAUGH
     Don’t blame you. I’m thinking of
     arresting my wife for cruelty to bacon.
          (beat)
     Merry Christmas, Martin.

               RIGGS
     Merry Christmas.

He walks off down the street.  Murtaugh watches him go.
Pause. Turns up his collar against the chill, takes a few
steps ... And a man steps in front of him.  The same Punk
who Riggs beat the shit out of at the very beginning of the
film.

               PUNK
     Hey, old man, got any money?

Murtaugh stops. Stares. Blinks. And proceeds to kick the
shit out of him. A kick. A punch. The Punk lies on the
sidewalk, semi-conscious. Murtaugh scowls and says:

               MURTAUGH
     I’m fifty. That’s not old, dickless.

EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK (SAME DAY)

RAIN pours down. Martin Riggs stands over a lone grave.
There are dark hollows under his eyes. The wind tugs at his
hair. The tombstone reads:

VICTORIA LYNN RIGGS

BORN:  1953

DIED:  1984

He reaches beneath his overcoat and removes a bright green
Christmas wreath, which he places atop the grave. Kisses
his fingertips. Presses them to the moist earth.

               RIGGS
     Merry Christmas.
          (beat)
     I love you.

The rains starts to fall. Riggs is oblivious.

EXT. MURTAUGH HOME - NIGHT

Carpenters are at work, patching and repairing.  The
Christmas lights still shine defiantly. A car pulls up.

                               CUT TO:

FRONT  DOOR

As a hand knocks softly: The door opens -- and there stands
young Rianne. Adorable. She looks up at the visitor... It
is Martin Riggs.

               RIANNE
     Hi.

               RIGGS
     Hi.

He hands something to her. She takes it. The bottle of
pills.  It has a red ribbon tied around it.

               RIGGS
     Give that to your dad. It’s a present.
     Tell him I won’t be needing them
     anymore.

Rianne nods.

               RIANNE
     Okay. You wanna come in?  We’re
     building.

Riggs thinks it over. Shakes his head:

               RIGGS
     No, that’s okay.
          (beat)
     You have a Merry Christmas, Missy.

               RIANNE
     Okay.

Riggs turns to go. Rianne stops him:

               RIANNE
     They say you’re the best.

Beat. He stops. Turns and looks at her.

               RIANNE
     Are you?

               RIGGS
          (big smile; wild wink)
     No one can touch me.

Rianne blushes.

Riggs begins to walk away, into the rain... Until Roger
Murtaugh appears from inside the boat on the trailer hitch.
He stands on deck and looks down at Riggs. Riggs stops.
They stand there in the rain for a moment. Then Murtaugh
looks him square in the eye and says:

               MURTAUGH
     Sucker, if you think I’m gonna cut the
     world’s lousiest Christmas turkey all
     by my lonesome, you’re nuts.

Riggs nods. A moment passes. Then:

               RIGGS
     I think your daughter kinda likes me.

               MURTAUGH
     You touch her, I’ll kill you.

               RIGGS
     You’ll try.

He smiles. Murtaugh smiles. The rain falls, as they enter
the house together, and we

                                      FADE OUT:
