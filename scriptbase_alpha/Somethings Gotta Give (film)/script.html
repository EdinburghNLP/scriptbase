<b>             SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE
</b>









                 Nancy Meyers
                June 14, 2002













<b>                                                            1.
</b>







<b>OVER BLACK
</b>
We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...







<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER
</b>
MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.

<b>                       HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
             Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
             satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
             fleeting age when everything just falls
             right into place. It's magic time and it
             can render any man, anywhere --
             absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
             expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
             'cause I've been dating them for over
             forty years...







<b>INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER
</b>
What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:







<b>A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN
</b>
The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

<b>                        HARRY
</b>
                 (to Hostess)
             Langer. ..
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.

<b>                       MAITRE'D
</b>
             Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.

<b>                       HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
             So what does a life of bucking the system
             all add up to?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         2.
</b>










<b>                    HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>
          To never settle down with the right woman
          for a life of leftovers and Christmas
          mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
          mini van parked in the garage. I think
          it's made me what I am today.
              (Harry smiles to someone
               across the room)
          The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
          Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
          should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
          life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
          and came in here once a month with a dame
          my age' for a porterhouse and a side of
I         spinach. I've wondered...







<b> NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION
</b>
Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

<b>IN HER FIFTIES.
</b>

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
          really my age. . .







<b>INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO
</b>
Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          There you have it. The story in a
          nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
              (Harry TRIPS, his wife
               looks disgusted)
          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
          me. I look like I'm about to die. God
          help me. I do not want to die.

<b>                                            SMASH CUT TO:
</b>

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         3.
</b>













<b>A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY
</b>
A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              ( singing)
          To all my thugs that be livin' it
          up, we say, what I do. To all my...
              (stops)
          Oh! This is it. Make a right.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (admiring the
               neighborhood)
          So baby, you're rich... .

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
          really...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          If she lives within a mile of here, she's
          rich.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          I guess a hit play will buy you a house
          in The Hamptons.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I'd like to meet your mother.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
          great. She's totally brilliant, but
          she's not your type.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You're overlooking one of the great
          things about me. I don't have a type.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (very directly)
          She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
          have a slight reputation for...

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         4.
</b>









Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          -- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          For never dating anyone over 30.
          Don't look at me like that.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It's just not true.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
          ass.
               (answers phone)
          Hold on. . .
               (then to Marin)
          It just so happens, my dear, that women
          of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
          think of it that way? No, it's always me.
          You dames are all alike.
               (then into phone)
          Hey...

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (amused, to herself)
          Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

<b>                    BARRY
</b>
              (into phone)
          Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
          else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
          find me. Who?
              (glances at Marin, she's
               not listening)
          I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                          5.
</b>










<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (all business)
          Make a right, left at the second
          fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
          breasts look in this sweater?

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (blushing)
          Yes you have actually.

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
          So it would be too much to mention it
          again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          I know. My mother doesn't know how
          to do things that aren't perfect.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (trying to keep up with
               him)
          Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
                     overnight bags and step out of the car.

<b>                     ARRY
</b>
          So, what are we gonna do out here,
          just the two of us, for two whole
          days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Tell me the truth, are you at all
          glad we waited?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                            6.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
             I'm incredibly glad we're finally
             going to do it.
                 (she's a bit disappointed)
             If that's the same as being glad we
             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
                 (slaps her tush)
             Let's go for a swim, how long will
             it take you to change?

<b>                       MARIN
</b>
             Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.

<b>                         MARIN
</b>
             Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
             Mom doesn't allow it.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
             But she allows you to strip in the
             front yard and bring men you're
             dating here to...

<b>                       MARIN
</b>
             She doesn't know everything I do...Or
             when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.







<b>INT. HOUSE
</b>
It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.

<b>                       MARIN
</b>
                 (TAKING OFF her belt)
             The fabulous living room, perfect for
             entertaining an intimate group of friends
             or that special someone.
                 (DROPS her belt then
                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
             complete with pool and ocean view.

<b>                    MARIN (CONT'D)
</b>
              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
          Your pants, please...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Gourmet kitchen's to your left
          where tonight I will whip you up a
          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (smiling)
          .. O-kay, going quickly now...
          Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

<b>                     M
</b>

<b>                     ARIN
</b>
          And this as they say on 'Cribs',
          your favorite show, is where the
          magic happens. Do we like it? Going
          once, going twice ...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          You know when I first started
          auctioneering someone told me if I was
          nervous to just picture everyone in the
          audience in their underwear. This sort of
          gives that a whole new meaning.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          I'm always a little nervous.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (removing his hands)
          So put on your bathing suit. I brought
          some champagne, I'll put it on ice.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         8.
</b>










<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.







<b>INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.







<b>INT. KITCHEN
</b>
Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

<b>                     E
</b>
out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

<b>                     RICA
</b>
          Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (in control)
          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
          knife.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         9.
</b>










<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (eyeing the knife)
          Do you... live here?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
          hand me the phone.
              (reaches out to Zoe
               without looking at her)

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You don't understand. I'm a friend
          of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
          the city and you what, wandered in
          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
              (looks at phone)
          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
              (redials)

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (calmly starts to move)
          Honestly, if you just...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Back off. She was in the Israeli
          army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (into phone)
          Yes. I have an intruder in my
          house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
          invited me here for the weekend.
          She's in her room right now,
          changing.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
              (GASPS even louder, really
                   scared now)
          You're dating my daughter?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        10.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (amused)
          Now who would've thought that would
          be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.

<b>                      MARIN
</b>
          Oh, fuck.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, God.
              (into phone)
          I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
          sure. No, he's not a burglar
              (with enormous difficulty)
          He's dating my daughter.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
          this weekend, you said you had to write.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Oh, man, this is really....

<b>                      ERICA
</b>
          Awkward.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Totally.. .but....
              (starts laughing)
          You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
          he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
          don't know the man. . .

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (still laughing)
          I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
          I'm an idiot. I should've told you
          I was bringing someone out.

<b>                    E

<b>                      RICA

          No, no, I should've told you we
          were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
          are.

<b>                                                        11.

All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Harry Langer. How are ya?

<b>                     MARIN
</b>
          Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
          Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
          Zoe.
               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
          mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
          totally spur of the moment thought we'd
          get out of the city for a few days.

<b>                    ERICA AND ZOE
</b>
          Of course...Right...Great...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (can't look at him)
          Honey, does Harry have a robe?

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
              (backing out)
          You know what? Actually, I think I should
          just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
          weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
          here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two
          stay. Harry, apologize about the near
          arrest.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>
          No, you were impressive. Very strong,
          very... "macho".

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (a little thrown)
          I don't think I was exactly "macho"

<b>          ...
</b>

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
          his underwear in my refrigerator I
          hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs

<b>                                                        12.

Marin watches. Dying.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
          hit the road.
              (salutes Erica and Zoe)
          Ladies...sensational meeting you.
              (then to Marin)
          Doll, call me.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>
          Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
          dramatic here. What are we four
          teenagers? We're all sophisticated
          people. Why can't we all stay, for the
          weekend? Your mother's got work to do
          I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
          thing, whatever that is and if we want to
          hang together, we'll hang together. If we
          don't, we don't. There's no reason why
          any of us should give up this spectacular
          weekend.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Seriously. I can handle it.

<b>                    ZOE
</b>
          I can totally handle it.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (on the spot)
          I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It can only go up from here.

<b>                                                   CUT TO:

<b>HARRY AND MARIN

          I mean a father substitute.

<b>                    ERICA

<b>                    ZOE

          Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

<b>                    ZOE

          Okay, so she was old enough not to
          feel Dave was walking out on her.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
          on me? Why do people assume when you
          break up after twenty years that the
          guy's the one who wanted out? Just
          because once we broke up he shtupped
          everything that moved...

<b>                    ZOE

          Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
          Just trying to figure out why such a

Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.

<b>                    HARRY

Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

          My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.

</b>
          So, Harry... What do you do?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I'm one of the owners of a record
          company among other things...

          Oh, really? Which record company?

<b>                    HARRY

          Drive by Records.

              (appalled at the name)
          "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
          joke? What is that?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It's a Hip Hop label.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.

          I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
          rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
          and crude for my taste, not to mention
          just a tad misogynistic.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Hey, a lot of people see rapping as

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

</b>
          So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
          happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

<b>                    ERICA

Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.

</b>
          About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
          is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
          about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
          this high strung, over-amped,
          controlling, know it all neurotic. . .

          At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
          the big buyer of the night.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I kept winking at Marin as she was
          conducting the auction and apparently
          every time I did that she misunderstood
          and I ended up buying cases of
          outrageously expensive wine.

          Long time ago. She was just this
          adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
          with the greatest pair of legs I'd

No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Any chance of you stopping here?

<b>          ZOE

Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so

           --forgive me honey for saying this,
           but they want girls that look like
           Marin so the whole over fifty
           dating scene is geared completely
           towards men leaving older women out
           and as a result that makes the
           older women more and more
           productive and more and more
           interesting, which, in turn, makes
           them even less desirable because as
           we all know -- men, especially
           older men, are threatened and
           deathly afraid of interesting and
           accomplished women. It's just so
           clear. Single older women, as a
           demographic, are as fucked a group
           as can ever exist.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his

          Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
          right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.

</b>
          Feel some pressure in my
          chest...it's real tight.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

<b>                    JULIAN

          What were you doing at the onset of
          the pain?

The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Great. Just needed to be sure
          because I put nitroglycerin into
          your-drip and if you had taken
          Viagra, the combo would make your
          heart leap right out of your
          body...







<b>CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED
</b>
As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Let's give him an aspirin and

          Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
          "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
          this works and I have every reason to
          believe it will, it's going to reverse
          what's going on so there will be little
          or no damage to your heart. You with me?
              (Harry nods. Julian places
               his hand on Harry's)
          Okay, here we go.

<b>THE HALLWAY
</b>
Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Oh, man, what if he doesn't make

<b>                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I don't know his family. I've gone

          He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

          He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

<b>                     ARIN
</b>
          This is a nightmare. I go out with
          a guy who's so old, he takes
          Viagra.

<b>                    ERICA

</b>
          All I can say is, thank God it didn't
          happen when he was inside you. That could
          be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Your Dad's gonna be okay.

His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
          mild heart attack. I gave him something
          to break up the clot in his artery and it
          worked beautifully.

          His EKG returned to normal almost
          immediately which means I don't expect
          any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

          Oh, man...
              (realizing it all now)

Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          We're out of the woods. I've given him
          something to sleep, it might make him a
          little loopy at first but then it should
          knock him out.
              (to Erica)
          You're Mrs. Langer?

Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters

          You know, I heard you had a place
          in the Hamptons. I really am a very
          big fan. I honestly think I've seen
          every play you've ever written.

          I think some were written before

          No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them

Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

The second he's gone:

his mouth open.

</b>
          Okay. You take care of it for me,

As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.

<b>                    MARIN

like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Take it easy kids, I just sat up
          too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
          good shape? How were my tests this
          morning?

<b>                    JULIAN

          Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
          got no thin , but good news here.

<b>                    LOWELL
</b>
          I must say, you do look good...
          considering. You have a little
          extra baggage under your eyes, but
          I know how to fix that.

<b>                    HARRY

          Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
              (then)

Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

<b>                    HARRY

          These are for you...

          Maybe not this much but...

<b>                    HARRY

          And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          This is just to thank you for your

more reserved than normal.

Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.

<b>EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

<b>                    NURSE
</b>
          Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
              (she stops)
          Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Look at these faces. Will you tell them
          I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

<b>CLOSE ON JULIAN
</b>
taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
          gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

<b>                    HARRY

          You don't have to but I can't put you in
          a car right now and I can't leave you in
          the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
          nearby for a few days and let me keep an
          eye on you 'til you get your strength
          back.

          Doc, I'm out in the middle of the

Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"







<b>EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

<b> NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

<b>                    HARRY

              (into phone)

          Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...

          Lowell, what was that?

              (looking down at the Tray)
          Your lunch.

Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

          Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
          I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:

</b>

<b>          SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?
</b>

</b>

<b>                                                        38.

Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.







<b>INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

<b>                    DAVE

Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.

 othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.

          Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.







<b>EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

<b>PHONE RING.
</b>







<b>INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES
</b>
Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.







<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
               (into phone)
          Can you hold a see, doll?
               (looks to Erica)
          Hey.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
          Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
          want to play the part of the uptight
          Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
          want to have another heart attack, go
          ahead, it's your life but I have work to
          do and I don't have time to make another
          run to the hospital because you're
          filling your already clogged arteries
          with smoke but more importantly, I'd
          rather not have my house smell like a
          pool hall.

Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
          What? Do I Hhave to say what?

<b>                     ARRY
</b>
          Have you always been like this or
          do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I don't think I've ever had this
          effect on a woman before.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (picking up the

          And what effect do you think you're
          having on me?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
          know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          So you don't sleep?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I only need about four hours a night.

<b>                    HARRY

          Can I ask you one other thing?
              (Erica turns)
          What's with the turtlenecks? It's
          the middle of summer.

<b>                    ERICA

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Just curious.

<b>                    ERICA

          I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
          just a turtleneck kinda gal.

<b>INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.

As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.

<b>ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT
</b>
She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

</b>

<b>HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
</b>
Seeing it all.

<b>ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

<b>HARRY
</b>
flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

<b>                    ERICA (O.S.)

<b>                    HARRY

          This is gonna be murder.







<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
</b>
A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.

<b>                    NURSE
</b>
          Good bye Mrs. Barry.

</b>
          Good bye? You're leaving? That's
          not good.

<b>                    NURSE
</b>
          Been fired.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
          Fired?   You just started.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          What do you mean, not needed? Of
          course we need her. She's gonna
          take care of you and feed you and...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          -- No, no, I'm actually feeling
          pretty perky today. Making quite a
          recovery. . .
              (opening the screen door)
          Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
          Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Listen, about last night.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
              (hands him some pills)
          I was at the drugstore. Your
          prescriptions were ready. They said take
          these two with food and this one without.

<b>                    HARRY

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.

<b>                    HARRY

          Out of breath?

<b>                    HARRY

          Only sometimes.

<b>                    JULIAN

          Erica. . .

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
          work. The woman wears turtlenecks
          in the middle of the summer.

<b>                                                      49.

<b>                    HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>
          She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
          her fun to be around.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
          noticed that.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (with secret glee)
          I actually saw her naked last
          night.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          That doesn't sound so uptight.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It was an accident. She thought I
          was asleep, I thought her room was
          the kitchen.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          You know what Freud said - there
          are no accidents.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
          why would she be walking around naked
          when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Why would you think her bedroom was
          the kitchen?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It was dark, it was two in the
          morning.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          That could explain why she was walking
          around naked. Deep breath...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You know I've never seen a woman
          that age naked before.

<b>                    JULIAN

<b>                    JULIAN

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
          just so you know, I'm told after a heart
          attack, if you can climb a flight of
          stairs, you can have sex.

<b>A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE
</b>
Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.

her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Listen, I've decided to get over the
          whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
          don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
          you all day.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I know. You want to come in?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I don't want to break your rhythm
          or anything.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
          venture out there and go for a
          short walk...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          You up to that?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        53.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          My doctor recommended it. I gotta
          build up to stairs and stuff like
          that. You wouldn't want to join me?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          That means you don't want me to?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          No, I was asking if you wanted to.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, well, I would but...I don't
          usually like to break once I've
          started writing so I probably
          shouldn't, not that a little fresh
          air would hurt but...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It's just a walk Erica, not a
          marriage proposal.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          You know my name.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
          on the internet.







<b>EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY
</b>
Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          -- Did you know there are over eight
          thousand websites that mention you?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          That can't be possible.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          No, it's true. I know everything
          about you now. And not because of
          last night, but...

<b>                    E
</b>

<b>                     RICA
</b>
          Yeah, I understood. I actually
          looked you up too. You grew up in
          L.A., which I thought nobody did.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         54.
</b>










<b>                    ERICA (CONT'D)
</b>
          You were the road manager for a group I
          sorta never heard of, started your own
          record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
          started buying and selling boutique
          companies then invested in a small record
          company which you turned into the 2nd
          largest Hip Hop label in the world.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It's exhausting just hearing about it.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I know, but the truth is, it goes
          fast doesn't it?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I noticed you have bowls of those
          all over your house.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I know, I'm crazy, I just think
          they're so beautiful...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          But why do you only pick up the white
          ones?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I don't only pick up the white ones.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Oh, so you really are crazy.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I pick up only the white ones?
              (looks in her hand)
          Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
          controlling, unadventurous, what?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          So you're as hard on yourself as
          you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Something to remember me by.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        55.
</b>









Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          So can I ask you something Harry? What's
          with all the young girls? I mean, what's
          the story there, really?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I just like to travel light.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          You just like to travel light? Oh,
          please, what the hell does that mean?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Now see a thirty year old gets that.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          You mean falls for that.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I mean, accepts it.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          If that's what you want... a non
          threatening woman, who won't get your
          number, you get to run the show...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I think our relationship is growing
          by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
          out of the house. Now, you may notice,
          interestingly, we're walking back toward
          the house and its getting a little rocky
          again.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Of course it's getting a little
          rocky, we're talking about you.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          See, I'll accept that slight
          hostility because I'm enjoying your
          company so much.

<b>T
</b>
 hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.

<b>                      ERICA
</b>
          You okay?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                           56.
</b>










<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
          watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Big dinner date?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
          With your doctor.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
          too young for you, huh?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          No, he's totally too young for me.
          But we're just having dinner. It's
          not a date.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Does he know that?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
          that he thinks of it that way.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
          may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
          not threatening, won't get your number,
          you get to run the show. You might have a
          hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.







<b>THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN
</b>
And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.

<b>AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
</b>
is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Hey, look who's answering the door.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          And look who's at the door.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Brought you something.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        57.
</b>









Julian hands him a take-out food box.

<b>                     JULIAN
</b>
          A heart healthy dinner from our
          cafeteria.

<b>                       ERICA (O.S.)
</b>
          Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          You look beautiful.

<b>                       ERICA
</b>
          Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (thrown)
          We ready..?

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Let me just see how Harry's doing.
          It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
          seat. .







<b>ANGLE - HARRY
</b>
sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.







<b>WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS
</b>
as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          What? That's not the face you want
          to see your doctor making.

<b>                     JULIAN
</b>
          Your pulse is a little fast but
          maybe you're just excited about
          something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         58.
</b>










<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (quickly)
          I don't think so. I'm not excited
          about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          There it goes again. Racing.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
          Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

<b>OUT THE DOOR.
</b>

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
          rush back for me and don't do anything I
          wouldn't do.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Well that wouldn't leave us too
          many options would it?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          And do we wonder how she writes
          that snappy repartee.
              (whispers to Erica)
          Let him pick up the check. It'll
          make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.







<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS
</b>
Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

<b>                     M
</b>
his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

<b>                     ARIN (O.S.)
</b>
          Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
          a message and I'll call you back.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Hey, it's me...just sitting around
          looking at your baby pictures...
          Thinking about you...

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                          59.

He hangs up, dials another number.

<b>                    ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>
          Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
          Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
          old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.







<b>INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (complimented)
          Top of the heap...

<b>CLOSE ON JULIAN
</b>
Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
          and the house was built in record time and...
              (blushing to death)
          It's like a thousand degrees in here.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          You know, they say doctors fall for
          people who need rescuing, that we have a
          need to take care of someone.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Really? I never heard that one.
              (starts fanning herself
               with the menu)
          Julian, how old are you, like...

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          -- Thirty-three.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                              60.
</b>










<b>          ERICA
</b>
Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.

<b>          JULIAN
</b>
You look fabulous.

<b>            ERICA
</b>
Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure
where you   were headed with that thing you
were just   saying, but in terms of us, you
just want   to be friends, right?

<b>          JULIAN
</b>
Honestly? No.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?

<b>          J
</b>

<b>           ULIAN
</b>
I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.

<b>          JULIAN
</b>
This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?

<b>          JULIAN
</b>
I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...

<b>          JULIAN
</b>
Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                          61.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
          my age, the ones I've met...well,
          I'm not that regular a person and
          they really like regular.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Men your age may be really stupid,
          you ever think of that?
              (takes her hand)

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yes I have. Many times.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
              (looks from her hand to
               her eyes)
          There's something radically wrong with
          the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          I knew you'd smell good.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          It's just...soap...

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          How much is soap that smells like this?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I don't know. I got it at the market.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          No, swear to God, I'm not...







<b>MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED
</b>
Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.







<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        62.

          It was interesting. So... Good night.







<b>INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

          'Night...







<b>INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

<b>W

 e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (to herself)
          How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.

Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.







<b>INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          We are cute...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not
          used to having sleepovers.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
          Me either.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Really? With your social life?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
          Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Okay, good to know.
              (heading for the kitchen)
          So, what are you hungry for?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (joining her)
          What are my choices? I mean I know you
          think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, God, what's the difference what I
          think. I can't imagine what you think of
          me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
          vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
          Pancakes.

          You ever miss being married? I bet you
          were great at it.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
          that much anymore. Was one of us just
          saying something interesting?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You said you can't imagine what I think
          of you.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
          that.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Okay.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
          curious but...'

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          will you tell me first why you only
          miss being married at night?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (cracking eggs)
          Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
          at night and the "alone" thing happens at
          night and sleeping by myself took some
          getting used to. But I got the hang of
          it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
          bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
          a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Okay, now I'm convinced what I
          think of you is right.
              (Erica waits. . . )
          You are a tower of strength.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Try not to rate my answer.

          You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
          mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
          like a great portrait over a fireplace.
          Words have been invented to describe
          women like you.

          Flinty   and...Impervious.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          So you think I'm inhuman.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          No. I think you're formidable.

<b>                    ERICA

          But cold and distant. Like I'm
          frozen in some painting...

          Not at all. I think you're strength

              (sees how sensitive she
               is)
          But it's thrilling when your defenses are
          down arid you're not isolated. That, I
          believe, is your winning combo. A killer
          combo actually.

<b>                    ERICA

          me.

Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (enters, kisses Erica)

<b>          I
</b>
            had this big photography auction
          tonight, then I went out with a
          bunch of people, I checked my
          messages and got this so sad
          message from Harry so bored out
          here. I thought I should come out
          and at least see how he was doing.
              (kisses Harry on the
               cheek)
          Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
          by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          So how are you guys?
              (sets down the Zabar's
               bag)
          Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
          pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
          pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

<b>                    ERICA

          Don't be silly. You know I never
          sleep and this one doesn't sleep
          either. It's... .What's in the
          bag?

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
              (reaches into the bag)
          A quart of matzoh ball soup for
          Harry. I know it's not the remedy
          for heart problems but it is low
          cholesterol.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (hating to correct her)
          But high sodium.

          Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your

          time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          So, Mar, now that you're here, why
          don't you finish the pancakes and

</b>
          Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          So your ex-husband stood me up
          today. We were supposed to have
          lunch at Barneys . He never showed
          up. Was he always like this?

          This is what happens after a couple

              (then to Harry, the flirt
               in her coming back)
          So how are you, how do you feel?
          When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.

Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.

cherries.

          Why? What do you mean?

<b>                    MARIN

          'Cause I met someone else.

<b>                    ERICA

          In the two days you've been gone?

<b>                    MARIN

          You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
          thousand people everyday. Also, let's
          face it, the guy's insanely old for me.

          True, but you know he is....

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          It's unnerving.

          Now, Mom, if you could handle this,

          You're a great woman, Erica.
              (Erica relaxes)
          Is this why my doctor is falling in
          love with you?

<b>THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER
</b>
Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.

<b>BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES
</b>
Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.

<b>A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY
</b>
Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

<b>LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.
</b>

<b>A MATCH IS STRUCK
</b>
and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.

<b>                       ERICA
</b>
          I'm sorry.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (truly confused)
          For what?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I just kissed you.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I know that one was me.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Soft lips...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          And you didn't even take Via-

 he kisses him long and sweet.

<b>ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          This could be world class
          interesting.
              (Erica nods)
          Having any doubts?

<b>                       ERICA
</b>
                 (as they kiss)
          Yes.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
          Me too.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          But so far the kissing is
          spectacular.
              (He looks at her)
          I'm not grading you, just
          mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Can't get past your damn
          turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (breathless)
          Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
              (she opens her eyes)
          Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.

</b>
              (thrilled)
          Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I think we should take your blood
          pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

</b>
          It's irresponsible not to.

<b> ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Nobody but you would. . .

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

hurdles recklessly into the air.

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
          do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I really thought I was sorta closed for
          business. Just never expected this.

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
              (nods)
          Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          This is crazy. I can't remember the last
          time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
              (crying with him)
          Me too. That's the perfect word.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
          attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

          Honey I may not be many things but one -

Harry holds her close.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Erica, Erica, Erica.
              (she turns to him)
          You know I'm not good at being

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Monogamous? Please, I hardly know

He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.

          before and I didn't have enough money for

          how far it was and I'm talking blizzard

second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in

Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:

 arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

messy haired, a little wiped.

for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

<b>                    ERICA

          You are woman to love. What the
          hell does that mean?

<b>AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.

</b>
          Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These

Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

          is an amazing woman. Does whatever
          she can to make me happy. Really.
          Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Very giving.

              (looking away)
          Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
          think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.

          It's very common to become emotional

          Everything takes on a new meaning.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (wiping his tears)
          So it's not crazy for a man to do
          something entirely out of character

<b>                    JULIAN

          I think you can expect just about
          anything right now. People have done some
          wild things after having a heart
          attack...selling businesses, getting
          divorced, moving... Some people say it
          saved their lives.

<b>                    HARRY

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the

</b>
          This is for you, Ace...
              (then, under his breath)

Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

           this evening's sale of Impressionistic
           and Modern Art. Bidders should know that
           the auctioneer may open bidding on any
           lot below the reserve by placing a bid on

           with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And
           $5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is
           bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000
           gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on
           the phone. . .

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

<b>A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30
</b>
We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.

<b>ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

<b>INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.

<b>                     JULIAN
</b>
           Guess I got stood up.

          Why not, I put. on the tie and
          everything. And can you bring me
          another. . .
              (indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

<b>TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT
</b>
and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

<b>IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.                D

          I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
          these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
          Kristen, where'd you go to...

          Bryn Mawr girl.

<b>                     KRISTEN

</b>
          Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
          but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Anyone mind?

<b>          MARIN
</b>
Okay, I'll just..have one.
    (lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.

<b>          DAVE
</b>
Shall we order?

<b>          KRISTEN
</b>
Absolutely.

Erica, do I like duck?

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Yes. It's rabbit you hate.

I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.

<b>          DAVE
</b>
Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.

</b>
    (pointing to herself and
    Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.

    (polishing off her

I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.

</b>
Really? What's that?

<b>             ERICA
</b>
His balls.

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't

Why did you order her a Martini?

          What? It's not true? The man can not
          watch TV or read without the hand down
          the pants-- Here's my advice after 21

          I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

<b>A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES
</b>
and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

<b>M
</b>

<b> OVING IN ON ERICA
</b>
as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.

<b>                    MARIN
</b>
          Mom, you okay?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.

<b>                     RICA
</b>
          You know what? Maybe I need a little
          air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
          Hey.

<b>                    ERICA

<b>EXT. RESTAURANT
</b>
Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (walking quickly)
          Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Harry, I gotta go...

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Erica, she's just a friend.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
          Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
          of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Come on, it's just a dinner...

<b>                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, here's the problem. I

</b>
          I really like you.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Yeah, but I love you like you.
              (that stops him)
          I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I think maybe you should consider
          that you're in love with the idea
          of being in love.

<b>          ERICA
</b>

<b>D
</b>
 o you? Okay. Oh, God...
    (stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
    (tries not to cry in front
     of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.

<b>           ERICA
</b>
-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?

<b>          HARRY
</b>
I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Uh-huh. . .

<b>          HARRY
</b>
I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
What was I thinking?

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Harry, I won't be good at this.

<b>           HARRY
</b>
At what?

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Acting like I don't care.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
    (freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                            96.
</b>










<b>          HARRY
</b>
Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Yeah. Mine too.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Then let's each get our bearings.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Yes I do.
    (she won't open up)
Tell me.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
    (Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
    (realizes)
You know what this is?
    (pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?

<b>          HARRY
</b>
You're killin' me.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Me too.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                      97.
</b>










<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          That's a horrible thing to say.
              (walks off, comes back)
          The life I had before I met you. I
          knew how to do that, could do that
          forever. Now look at me...what do I
          do with all this?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Can we talk tomorrow?

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          What for? I saw your friend you were
          having dinner with, if that's what you
          want, it's never going to work with me.
          Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
          don't let this brown hair fool you, I
          don't have a real brown hair on my head,
          I'm almost all grey...that would freak
          you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
          cholesterol and my back hurts every
          morning and I'm post menopausal and I
          have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
          is just around the corner and I know
          you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
          it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
          lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          And you know what? Everyday, I'm
          gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>
          Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I just... the truth is... I don't
          know how to be a boyfriend.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
          That's what you have to say after all
          this? You don't know how to be a
          boyfriend.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                           98.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Are we done?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (winces)
          Ouch.
He grabs his heart.

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her

<b>                    . DR. MARTINEZ
</b>
          That's good. Not like before is we

<b>                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)
</b>
          Based   on what I see so far, your
          heart   is not in distress but I'm
          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be
          sure.    What were you doing at the
          onset   of the pain?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
          a woman give you chest pain?

<b>                    DR. MARTINEZ
</b>
          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
          heard?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I

               he is)
          All right, well you're battin' a thousand
          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
          like the kind of pain we worry about. I
          think what you experienced was normal
          chest pain associated with stress.

<b>                      HARRY

          Stress?

<b>                    DR. MARTINEZ
</b>
          And incase you haven't heard, that can
          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
          out and about at this hour, but if you
          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
          in bed, recuperating.

<b>INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.

          If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.

at her glasses.

A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.

excited.             J

Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an

He writes: Do I hear French Music?

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's

thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.

Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

Not really. Sometimes. Not right

<b>          MARIN

So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.

this so your feelings won't get

Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's

as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

<b>                    ERICA

          Fine. I understand.

<b>                    HARRY

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
We didn't just have sex either.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
Then what was it? Love to know.

<b>           HARRY
</b>
Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
     (laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?

<b>          ERICA
</b>
You don't want to be friends.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
    (tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
    (realizes)
It almost feels good.

<b>          ERICA
</b>
I think I'm mad at you too.

<b>          HARRY
</b>
Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...

<b>          ERICA
</b>
-- You've worried about me?

<b>          HARRY

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.

          Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.

          You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

<b>                    HARRY

              (the Woman laughs)
          Right? I broke her heart then she married

He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

<b>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I know but I've certainly been thinking
          about you. There's a lot I have to say.
          First thing is... I'm not mad at you
          anymore.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
          anymore either.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          That's a relief...since I did come all
          the way to France and everything. And...
          Happy Birthday.

<b>                     ERICA
</b>
              (afraid of everything he
              could possibly say)
          Thank you.

<b>                     HARRY
</b>
          And congratulations on your amazing
          success...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
          maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
          Where've you been?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          After I saw you in the theater that
          afternoon, I had another "episode...

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          Oh, I'm sorry.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
          dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
          to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
          there and changed my life, sold most of my
          businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
          island in the Caribbean.

          time? In the Caribbean?

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Actually...No.







<b>EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.
</b>
          I was there about ,six hours, when it
          occurred to me that wasting away on an
          island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
          remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

<b>BLACK SCREEN
</b>
A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          So I decided to take another kind of
          pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
          and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.

<b>                                         BACK IN PARIS
</b>

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          -- maybe I could figure out how I
          got so screwed up.

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

<b>SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.
</b>

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          But I was on a mission to save my
          soul.

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.

Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          My losing streak finally ended when
          I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."

<b>                    HARRY (V.O.)
</b>
          Hearing what they had to say was no
          picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.

<b>                     ARRY (V .O.)
</b>
          But I stuck it out and I listened.
          Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

<b>                    HARRY (V. O. )
</b>
          And one of the things I realized
          was, I was actually giving closure
          to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

<b>                    HARRY (V. O. )
</b>
          Although I admit, some refused to
          give, no matter what I did. . .

<b>CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER
</b>
On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.

          When you hear the same story about
          yourself over and over, your life
          begins to make sense and the future
          becomes your only salvation.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          It took me six months to find them
          all. I visited 18 different states
          but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

<b>                    A MAN'S VOICE
</b>
          I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

<b>                       HARRY
</b>
          Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

<b>                    ERICA
</b>
          I should have told you he was coming, but
          I was so engrossed in your story.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          What story..?

<b>                     HARRY

          Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
              (looks from Erica to
               Julian, it all dawns on
               him)
          I guess I should've seen your play, then
          I would've Jknown how this ended.

<b>                     ULIAN

          impossible to buy for... But I
          think I finally found the right
          gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

          No, no, you know what, I'll let you
          two celebrate...

<b>THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.

<b>THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER

Erica lights a cigarette.

<b>                    JULIAN
</b>
          What are you doing, you don't
          smoke?

          She's very brilliant, but the woman
          can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

</b>
          I like that about me.

<b>                    BOTH GUYS

The Guys exchange looks.

          Now, if I were writing this, this
          is where I'd write, 'an awkward

<b>                    HARRY

          Honey, if you were writing this,

Erica laughs.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
          Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

</b>
          No, Harry, please, let us...

<b>                    HARRY

Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

          Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

          New York. What do they do around
          here for fun?







<b>INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.

<b>                    BOTH GUYS
</b>
              (at the same time)
          Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

<b>ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.

Harry is gone.

<b>EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

<b>EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

<b>                    HARRY
</b>
              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

<b>                    HARRY

          Because I realized what I was feeling for

          something I didn't understand, like a
          language I didn't speak...
              (she listens...)
          It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
          away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
          to get over. You were somethin' else.
              (she's starting to melt)
          And when I went to see all those women, I
          found out I was never really present for
          any of them. And something inside me at
          some point, had just...shut off. That's
          when I think my heart gave out and you
          saved me. I finally get what it's all
          about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
          for the first time in my life. And that's
          what I came here to say.

<b>                    ERICA

          I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I

          But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
          this work.

          Okay.

<b>                    HARRY

          Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.

through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
