EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY

A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of 
the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man 
gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE 
NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up 
suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his 
shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He 
wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. 
[Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & 
WHITE.]

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     I get outta the truck in this two-
     bit town. I got no money and no 
     prospects. What I need right now is 
     a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a 
     hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order 
     they come...

EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling 
picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO 
RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- 
     an angle.

He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, 
then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     I was thinking -- if it weren't for 
     bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck 
     at all...

               LANDLADY (O.S.)
     Can I help you?

The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding 
the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, 
small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front 
and clings with sweat to her generous curves.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     Either my luck had just changed, or 
     Fate just bought me another round of 
     trouble.

INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the 
narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third 
story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We 
can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:

               LANDLADY
     ...not very fancy... house needs 
     repairs... We haven't had a man around 
     here for so long...

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     She kept yammerin' the whole time, 
     but her hips were doing all the 
     talking...

The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs 
and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and 
tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous 
body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. 
His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the 
door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying 
with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     It couldn't 'a been any clearer what 
     the set-up was. The next move was up 
     to me...

The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Don't tell me!

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing.

               MUMFORD
          (softer)
     -- That's all the time we have. 
     Sorry...
          (indicates his watch)
     ...next time.

We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a 
therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, 
with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] 
His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer 
in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's 
a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding 
hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his 
fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but 
now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.

               FOLLETT
     I have eighteen more minutes!

               MUMFORD
     I don't want to hear any more today.

               FOLLETT
     Why not?

               MUMFORD
     Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't 
     you?

               FOLLETT
     Well, I don't know... I only been 
     seeing you --

               MUMFORD
     Without trust, there's no point to 
     any of this. You might as well not 
     come.

               FOLLETT
     Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't 
     want to come --

               MUMFORD
     Good, then go.

INT. LILY'S CAFÉ- DAY

Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, 
crossing from the two-story building that houses his office 
on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is 
also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter 
to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around 
forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

               LILY
     You're early... it's not ready. What 
     happened?

               MUMFORD
     My patient had to leave early.

               LILY
     Who was that?

She comes over to the register with an order. Mumford is 
am[...] her, likes her a lot.

               MUMFORD
     Does the phrase "nosy" have any 
     meaning to you, Lily?

               LILY
     I think it's like... inquisitive.

               MUMFORD
     It was Henry Follett.

               LILY
          (reacts)
     Man, you see him a lot. And it's 
     very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll 
     be saying what his problem is.

               MUMFORD
     What do you want to know?

               LILY
     You're terrible. I'm never telling 
     you anything.

A Patron passes on the way out.

               PATRON
     Hey, Doc... how's it going?

               MUMFORD
     Fine, Vincent... how's yourself?

               LILY
     How long you been in this town?

               MUMFORD
     Oh, I don't know...

               LILY
     Four months, two and a half weeks -- 
     that's how long.
          (Mumford gives her a 
               look)
     And you've already got more patients 
     than those other two shrinks combined.

               MUMFORD
     Lily, I don't think even you could 
     know that --

Lily sees something out the window.

               LILY
     Look at that guy...

Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about 
30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the 
street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. 
He zips past the front of the restaurant.

               LILY
     You know who that is, don't you?
          (Mumford does not)
     You really don't? That's Skip 
     Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit 
     by a truck, this whole town shuts 
     down.

               MUMFORD
     Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.

LILY hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up. Back on 
track:

               LILY
     So, what makes you so popular? What's 
     your secret?

               MUMFORD
          (takes his bag to go)
     You like me. How come?

               LILY
     Not sure. Let me think about it.

Mumford is smiling as he goes out. Another Patron, LIONEL 
DILLARD, a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford 
cross the street. Lily can't stand this guy.

               LIONEL
     That's the new psychiatrist?

               LILY
     Psychologist. He's not medical.

               LIONEL
     Probably thinks he's pretty smart.

Lily gives him a look as she takes his money.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on 
Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide 
whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit 
up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps 
taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy 
handbag.

               NESSA
     ...so he already had the tattoo that 
     said, "Naomi Forever"... and now 
     they're broken up, see, and he has 
     to have it removed. But while the 
     scar is still healing, or whatever 
     you call it when you have a tattoo 
     removed, he meets Chandra. And it's 
     serious, immediate love. So in no 
     time, he's gone from the most gorgeous 
     model in the world to the most 
     gorgeous actress in North America.

               MUMFORD
     What do you mean, "in no time"?

               NESSA
     In maybe three or four issues.

               MUMFORD
     Weekly or monthly?

               NESSA
     Monthly! God, how shallow do you 
     think Brad is? Why do I waste my 
     time telling you this stuff?

               MUMFORD
     Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?

               NESSA
     Don't do that thing...
          (Mumford: what?)
     ...that shrink thing.

               MUMFORD
     It's a big part of the show.

She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, 
but is afraid to actually break his rules.

               NESSA
     You really need to let people smoke 
     in here, you know. It's perverse. 
     What are they paying you to see me?

Mumford indicates "nothing".

               NESSA
     The school board doesn't pay you? 
     What kind of deal is that?

               MUMFORD
     It's called pro bono.

               NESSA
     Pro boner?
          (he waits her out)
     Pro bono, huh? For whose good, 
     supposedly?

               MUMFORD
     It's my bit for the community.

               NESSA
     Fuck the community.
          (he won't go for it)
     There was this article my friends 
     and I read. It was "25 Signs He's 
     Great in Bed". It was very 
     fascinating.

               MUMFORD
     Where was this?

               NESSA
     Where?... The New York Times. The 
     first one was -- "he handles produce 
     well." Which we already knew!
          (an expression she 
               uses)
     The point is, you have a lot of the 
     signs.

               MUMFORD
     You been spying on me in the 
     supermarket, Nessa?

               NESSA
     Have women found you attractive?

Mumford laughs.

               NESSA
     I knew you wouldn't answer. I've 
     been thinking about what you said 
     last time. How me trying to lose 
     weight -- and constantly not -- is 
     like a lot of people with addictions. 
     How maybe I can't lose the weight, 
     ever...
          (quietly)
     Which we already knew...

               MUMFORD
     That's not quite what I said --

               NESSA
     It's a really weird thing for a shrink 
     to say... and then you said maybe 
     people'd be happier if they'd accept 
     that some things don't change -- 
     that it'd be some kind of a relief 
     or something...

Mumford waits.

               NESSA
     Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch, 
     but how depressing is that moment -- 
     the moment when you give up?

EXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC

The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees 
as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the 
edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.

WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights 
just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it 
for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp 
from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks 
like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and 
turns his head to watch the beam move about.

WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and 
turns off the light.

INT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT

The place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a 
favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's 
sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.

SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone 
in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons 
greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. 
He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford 
and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting 
for his attention.

               SKIP
     Hi.

Mumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand.

               SKIP
     You're Doc Mumford.
          (Mumford nods)
     Skip Skipperton.

               MUMFORD
     How are you?

               SKIP
     Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been 
     hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot 
     about you.

Mumford waits, friendly. Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, 
glances around.

               SKIP
     Do you think we could...? Can I buy 
     you a drink?

                                   CUT TO:

[...]

LATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while, 
but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice 
down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.

               SKIP
     ..."Find the need and fill it" my 
     dad used to say -- I guess a lot of 
     dads say that -- but I did and it 
     just took off.

               MUMFORD
     No kidding... Panda. Where'd that 
     come from?

               SKIP
     Panda? I've always liked giant 
     pandas... I've been to China and 
     seen them in the wild. That's the 
     kind of thing I can do if I want... 
     now. I can do pretty much anything I 
     want to do these days.

Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought 
depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back --

               SKIP
     So now we make 23% of the modems in 
     the market, which is pretty good.

Skip glances around, leans in, confidential.

               SKIP
     When I was growing up here, the town 
     was about dead. The timber business 
     was played out... Panda changed all 
     that. Now, just about everybody in 
     town either works for the company or 
     depends on it somehow. Which is kinda 
     the problem...

Mumford waits, watches. Skip gets uncomfortable.

               SKIP
     Would you like another beer?

               MUMFORD
     Nah... scotch.

               SKIP
          (brightens, like a 
               kid)
     Far out. Single malt?
          (gets up)
     Can I pick it?

Skip heads off to the bar. Mumford looks around. Everybody 
is watching.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER. The bar crowd has thinned. Both Mumford and Skip have 
had a few. In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them 
each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the 
table.

               MUMFORD
     You want me... to be... your friend.

Skip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential 
way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in 
too. Mumford is almost whispering --

               MUMFORD
     But that's not what's really going 
     on...
          (Skip is excited)
     ...What's really going on is... you 
     have some problems and you want some 
     therapy, but you feel it could be 
     very bad for Panda Modem stock if 
     word got out that you were having 
     head problems.

Skip confirms that's it.

               MUMFORD
     Can I ask you a personal question?

               SKIP
     Of course! That's exactly what I 
     want.

               MUMFORD
     Have you thought about getting a 
     wife?

Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "YES!", 
but also total frustration and failure.

               SKIP
     When Panda started to happen, I was 
     dating women from New York, San 
     Francisco, L.A. They came out of the 
     woodwork. Models, actresses, venture 
     capitalists... These were not the 
     kind of girls who were interested in 
     me before I hit it... And you know 
     what I discovered? I discovered these 
     girls did not love me for myself. 
     The majority of them didn't even 
     like me. But a lot of them would've 
     gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a 
     while. Can you imagine that -- 
     marrying someone just because they've 
     got money?

Mumford considers that.

               SKIP
     I gotta pee.
          (he gets up, a little 
               wobbly)
     Can I ask you something? This town 
     is called Mumford... Been that way 
     since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...
          (finally remembers)
     ...thirteen! Right?
          (Mumford: if you say 
               so)
     Now here's the question -- Your name 
     is Mumford, too.

               MUMFORD
     Is that the question?

               SKIP
     You moved here from back East and 
     your name is the same as this town. 
     Is that right?
          (Mumford shrugs)
     Far out.

Skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes 
back and leans down toward Mumford.

               SKIP
     I hope you don't think I want you to 
     do this for free. Just because we're 
     gonna play it like we're friends, 
     doesn't mean I won't pay you like a 
     doctor.

               MUMFORD
     I understand.

               SKIP
     I have a lot of money. Do you know 
     how much money I've got?

               MUMFORD
     Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going 
     to tell you what I've got.

               SKIP
     I've got three big ones.

               MUMFORD
     I'm impressed. I couldn't make three 
     million dollars if I lived three 
     lifetimes.

               SKIP
     No, no... I have three billion 
     dollars.

Skip stumbles off to take a leak. Mumford takes a moment to 
digest that. It's difficult.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked 
about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch, 
talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority 
complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be 
lasting an eternity.

               LIONEL
     ...so I'm watching Brokaw and they've 
     got some astronomer, this little 
     limey know-it-all, and he's telling 
     how, with this Himball telescope, 
     they've discovered there are maybe 
     400 million more galaxies than they 
     thought there were. And I guess that's 
     supposed to make me feel small? I'm 
     supposed to feel insignificant? Is 
     that the point? Because I can tell 
     you it didn't.

Mumfords eyes dart to look at --

THE CLOCK on the bookshelf: 2:23

               MUMFORD
     Lionel, since this is our first 
     session together, maybe --

Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at 
Mumford.

               MUMFORD
     -- you can sit up and look at me if 
     you'd like --
          (Lionel waves that 
               off and looks away)
     -- maybe it would be helpful if you 
     told me a little about what brought 
     you here.

               LIONEL
     Kind of impatient for a big-time 
     headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout 
     you let me explain it my own way...

As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE 
CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's 
eyes dart toward his desk --

A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur 
stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone.

               LIONEL
     ...and in the dream, it's always the 
     same, I wake up in my room from when 
     I was I kid in Ohio, and I realize 
     this is the day of the big exam at 
     school...

Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's 
going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at 
the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting 
to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --

               LIONEL
     ...which is no problem for me, because 
     I remembered it was coming and I've 
     attended every class, so I'm totally 
     prepared. Then I see myself running 
     down the hall at school...

MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the 
gleaming letter opener.

Mumford closes his eyes. We CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted 
hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE 
TINT.]

               LIONEL (V.O.)
     ...but it's not really my school -- 
     and this is very interesting -- it's 
     the school from the next district --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     -- Go on!

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and 
stares alarmed.

               LIONEL (V.O.)
     And even though I arrive a little 
     bit early, everybody's already there. 
     But the surprising part is --

WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the 
Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an 
exam toward Young Lionel.

               LIONEL (V.O.)
     -- I'm the only one who's prepared!

                                   CUT TO:

INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch 
reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There 
are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, 
woven carry-all.

The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. 
Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who 
is getting up from the couch in some confusion.

               LIONEL
     -- you crazy? You can't do this!

               MUMFORD
     Sure I can, Lionel.

               LIONEL
     I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I 
     like my clients? I can't stand most 
     of them! But I don't kick them out...

               MUMFORD
     See that sign -- We retain the right 
     to refuse service to anyone. I'm not 
     going to charge you for this session, 
     but I don't want to see you back 
     here.

Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot 
Althea watching the show from the couch.

               LIONEL
     Don't you at least have a back door 
     I can use?

               MUMFORD
     Come out this way. There's no shame 
     in getting a little therapy... is 
     there, Althea?

Althea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's 
knees.

               ALTHEA
     Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel.

Lionel steams by them in a black mood.

               LIONEL
     Maybe some of us don't need this 
     crap!

               MUMFORD
     And it's the Hubble Telescope, not 
     the Himball Telescope.

Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside --

               MUMFORD
     Jeez... what an asshole.

Althea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough 
of this guy.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY

Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the 
box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and 
tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, 
patient.

               ALTHEA
     What do they want from me?
          (more sobbing)
     What have I done that's so wrong?
          (pulling it together)
     They act as though they don't have 
     their own peculiar things... They 
     do! Believe me. Everybody's got 
     something...
          (looks at Mumford)
     Even you probably have things.

               MUMFORD
     Me more than most.

               ALTHEA
     Why are they ganging up against me?

               MUMFORD
     I'm not sure. But I think they're 
     worried about you.

               ALTHEA
     It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. 
     He had nothing to do with this -- 
     except pay, of course. He's always 
     willing to pay. He's extremely 
     generous.
          (a long beat)
     I'm so humiliated that my own children 
     would threaten me.

               MUMFORD
     How did they threaten you?

               ALTHEA
     They said if I didn't get help, they 
     wouldn't deal with me any more.
          (a beseeching look)
     What do you think about that?

               MUMFORD
     Good kids.

Althea stares at him a long moment. She knows he's right. 
Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. She grabs 
another Kleenex. In the midst of the torrent she tries to 
talk, but it's undecipherable:

               ALTHEA
     Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.

               MUMFORD
     Hmm?

Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.

               ALTHEA
     I said... you must come out to the 
     house for dinner on Thursday.

               MUMFORD
     Really? You think so?

               ALTHEA
     Yes. Jeremy will be home for the 
     weekend. And you can meet the kids.

Mumford considers, then nods his assent.

EXT. MUMFORD'S STREET - MAGIC

Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags. 
He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty 
street, which rises out of the main business district, seen 
beyond Mumford.

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the 
driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.

The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the 
restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the 
greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees 
Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around 
Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.

               MUMFORD
     How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.

               LILY
     Doc.
          (doesn't look up)
     Ainge...

The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries 
up the stairs.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen 
counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and 
picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the 
channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just 
beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- 
disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack 
hosting.

CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole 
show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the 
show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the 
bags.

INT. COOK'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Mumford is comparing different stepladders. MR. COOK, the 
sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but 
now --

               COOK
     Dr. Mumford.

               MUMFORD
          (doesn't really know 
               him)
     Mr. Cook.

               COOK
     Could you come with me please?

Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the 
back.

BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat 
of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand. 
Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --

               COOK
     I know I shoulda come to your office. 
     I was gonna, actually, but then when 
     you walked in here today...

               MUMFORD
     Uh-huh.

               COOK
     It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta 
     problem.

               MUMFORD
     What's that?

               COOK
     We're not sure. She's been to all 
     kinds of doctors in the city and 
     they've said different things. Some 
     of 'em are callin' it --
          (wants to get this 
               right)
     -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest 
     are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue 
     Symptom...

               MUMFORD
     Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

               COOK
     That's it -- syndrome. So you know 
     all about it?

               MUMFORD
     No... a little. There's a lot of 
     debate about it.

               COOK
     Yeah, I got that. Some people think 
     it's all in their heads.
          (more intense)
     It's been so bad she's had to move 
     back here to Mumford and live with 
     us. And I'm not sure that's the best 
     thing, either...

               MUMFORD
     Why's that?

               COOK
     Oh... a lot of things. Several 
     different factors. Will you see her, 
     Doctor Mumford?

               MUMFORD
     Sure. Why don't you bring her up to 
     my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

Cook nods, but looks worried.

               COOK
     I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a 
     mood. Do you ever go to somebody's 
     house?

               MUMFORD
     Generally that doesn't work out so 
     well. It sends the wrong message to 
     people who need to make a change.

Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But 
he's worried.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-
foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. 
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.

               MUMFORD
     Hello, Lionel.

               LIONEL
     You've got to have the right ladder 
     for the job. You don't know what 
     you're doing, you can get yourself 
     in trouble.

               MUMFORD
     You're right, as usual. See you.

Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who 
watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small 
medical building.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, 
vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her 
thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, 
listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the 
coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet-
unseen visitor --

               LIONEL (O.S.)
     ...completely inappropriate and highly 
     unprofessional. Now I don't want to 
     presume to tell you how to run your 
     businesses --

               SHEELER
     -- practices.

Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case --

               LIONEL
     -- Whatever. Six months ago, you two 
     were the only games in town. The 
     value of your...
          (mocking)
     ..."practices" could be seriously 
     undermined by this bozo. A town this 
     size has only so many headcases to 
     go around.

               DELBANCO
     What exactly would you have us do, 
     Lionel?

               LIONEL
     Protect your turf! Check this guy 
     out. I smell a rat, I tell you.

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel 
distasteful.

               SHEELER
     Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco 
     shares my gratitude for your concern. 
     But I also know he'd agree that you 
     misunderstand the nature of our 
     calling to mental health. We're not 
     in some... widget business, trying 
     to crush our competition.

               LIONEL
     What the hell's a widget?

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the 
stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco 
peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on 
us.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at 
Sheeler.

               DELBANCO
     What an asshole!

               SHEELER
          (agrees)
     Ernest, what do you think?

               DELBANCO
     I think he's got a point.

So does she.

EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY

Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by 
lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and 
Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and 
forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the 
wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally --

               SKIP
     This is great!

SLAP... SLAP.

               SKIP
     This is exactly what I wanted.

SLAP... SLAP.

               MUMFORD
     Skip, you must have lots of people 
     you can throw a ball with.

               SKIP
     You'd be surprised. Most guys have 
     kids or wives or girlfriends. They're 
     busy. It's not as easy as you think.

               MUMFORD
     Skip, you're the head of the whole 
     deal here. Are they busier than you?

               SKIP
     Well, you know... that's the thing. 
     Like I said, just about everybody in 
     town works for me. And it's just not 
     the same asking someone to throw a 
     ball when they work for you. It's 
     like an order or something... And no 
     one -- no one -- asks me.

Mumford considers. SLAP... SLAP... SLAP.

               MUMFORD
     So, would you say we're out here... 
     let me think how to put this... Is 
     your problem really that you're... 
     lonely?

               SKIP
     Don't you like this?

               MUMFORD
     Hell yes, I like it. What's better 
     than this? Most guys would kill just 
     to have someone do this with them 
     whenever they like.

               SKIP
     Okay then.
          (SLAP... SLAP)
     Have you got a lot of friends?

               MUMFORD
          ("nope")
     Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, 
     runs the coffee shop?

               SKIP
     No... I've seen her. Good-looking 
     woman.

               MUMFORD
          (agrees)
     She's probably ten years older than 
     you.

               SKIP
          (SLAP... SLAP)
     Good-looking woman.

               MUMFORD
     Lives downstairs from me. She's got 
     a great dog named for Danny Ainge.

               SKIP
          (sparks to that)
     Really? I'm the only person I know 
     that likes Danny Ainge, outside of 
     Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.

               MUMFORD
     Well, there's Lily.

               SKIP
     Did you know that Danny Ainge was 
     drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you 
     know what kind of athlete you have 
     to be to play in the NBA and in the 
     bigs?

               MUMFORD
     Amazing.

               SKIP
     Unbelievable...
          (SLAP... SLAP)
     ...And Lily named her dog after him? 
     Far out.

               MUMFORD
     What kind of person do you have to 
     be to do this?

Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet 
seen.

               SKIP
     What?

               MUMFORD
     This --

                                   CUT TO:

REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, 
lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a 
brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park. 
Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is 
in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black 
eyes and ears, round body.

Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.

               SKIP
     I would've traded any of it to have 
     made the Mumford High varsity.

Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.

               SKIP
     So I guess Henry Follett is a patient 
     of yours. He's my pharmacist.

               MUMFORD
     Yeah.
          (SLAP... SLAP)
     Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he 
just throws the ball.

               MUMFORD
     Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. 
     Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned 
     ones, from back when people cared 
     about atmosphere and character.

               SKIP
     Uh-huh.

               MUMFORD
     Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot 
     better than his real one. Nothing 
     can live up to it. His wife got sick 
     of it and left him. Took his kids 
     with her.

               SKIP
     I wondered what happened to her...

Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems 
oblivious, unusually talkative --

               MUMFORD
     Of course, it's not that simple. 
     There's something powerful going on 
     there. We've got a lot of work to 
     do.
          (announcer voice)
     It's hit to the warning track!

For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a 
long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running 
and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to 
Mumford.

               MUMFORD
     In these fantasies, Henry Follett is 
     played by a handsome guy with biceps. 
     Can you imagine that? Where your 
     self-esteem has to be?
          (throws him the ball)
     Man, I'd just like to move the guy 
     to the point where he gets to appear 
     in his own fantasies.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit 
cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- 
and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her 
cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands 
up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly 
to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for 
her, and goes out.

Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he 
walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it.

MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we 
see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. 
He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to 
reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter --

SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat 
disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards 
Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of 
the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford.

CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, 
facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any 
moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.

               MUMFORD
     Feel free to lie down. Most people 
     do.

               SOFIE
     I'd better not, I'll fall right to 
     sleep. I think it's too soon for me 
     to be sleeping with you.

A joke. Mumford smiles.

               MUMFORD
     What can you tell me about this?

               SOFIE
     Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting 
     to tell you...
          (tiny smile, to herself)
     ...about my exhaustion. I didn't 
     really want to come. I'm not hopeful 
     right now. But I couldn't take the 
     look on my dad's face. He's a truly 
     kind person, which is pretty 
     extraordinary if you knew the story. 
     He's the opposite of me, I guess -- 
     all stamina and resolve.

It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a 
bit into the couch.

               MUMFORD
     When did you start to feel this way?

               SOFIE
     About six months ago, I guess it is 
     now. God, it seems like years. What 
     a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before 
     this happened -- when I'd hear people 
     talk about this kind of thing -- I 
     thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a 
weak but magical sound.

               MUMFORD
     What?

               SOFIE
     You think that now! You think it's a 
     bunch of hooey, don't you?

               MUMFORD
          (unconvincing)
     No.

               SOFIE
     I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him 
clearly.

               SOFIE
     That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother 
     always says -- "Everything that's 
     wrong with you is in your head." I 
     suppose that's true.

               MUMFORD
     Back when this started, was there 
     anything unusual happening in your 
     life? A change of job, of living 
     situation... a loss of some kind?

               SOFIE
     No... but it started one year to the 
     day after my divorce became final. 
     That's not too suspicious, is it?... 
     But it wasn't like I was feeling bad 
     about the divorce. Just the opposite.

               MUMFORD
     Hmm.

               SOFIE
     Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?

               MUMFORD
     Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. 
     Sometimes, with enough clues, it's 
     possible to figure these things out.

               SOFIE
     Even if you don't think it's real?

               MUMFORD
     I don't know what's real and what 
     isn't. That's never been my strong 
     suit. But if you're tired all the 
     time and you've had to give up the 
     life you were having and come back 
     home when you didn't want to... that's 
     worth trying to fix. Maybe I can 
     help you do that.

               SOFIE
     What would you do?

               MUMFORD
     We... we would try several things. 
     But I need to see you a lot.

               SOFIE
     I don't know. I barely made it today.

               MUMFORD
     I'll come to you. We'll try a little 
     walking.

Sofie suddenly looks defeated.

               MUMFORD
     We'll take it slow. You'll never 
     feel you can't handle it.

               SOFIE
     I don't think I can afford it. I 
     don't want my dad paying.

               MUMFORD
     We'll work it out.

Sofie gives him a long look.

               SOFIE
     You have the best answer for 
     everything.
          (Mumford shrugs)
     You seem so... hopeful. Are you always 
     this sunny?

               MUMFORD
     No one ever thought so. You must 
     bring it out.

               SOFIE
     Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone 
     agrees my immune system's way down.

               MUMFORD
     Maybe you'll catch it.

               SOFIE
     Can I ask you something?
          (Mumford: of course)
     Didn't you tell my dad you didn't 
     think it was a good idea to come to 
     the patient?
          (he admits it)
     So what changed?

Mumford just smiles. He doesn't want to tell her the truth -- 
everything.

EXT. BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and 
beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the 
outskirts of town.

INT. HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed 
house. The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, 
is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked 
everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling 
their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some 
hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered 
housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If 
it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything 
can), it is here. Althea sounds very nervous, cheery.

               ALTHEA
     -- sorry everything's in such an 
     uproar. Lots of big occasions coming 
     up, and of course Christmas is only 
     eight months away --
          (giggles uncontrollably)
     -- I don't know what's keeping Jeremy. 
     You know he stays in the city three 
     nights a week -- I guess I explained 
     that...
          (Mumford nods)
     ...I know Katie's here, but I'm not 
     so sure about Martin... I'm making 
     dinner myself tonight, so I'll have 
     to leave you, I'm afraid...

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a 
spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an 
elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford 
toward.

               ALTHEA
     I'm awful I know, but will you please 
     help yourself. I just got a new copper 
     sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and 
     I'm afraid it'll be the death of us 
     all if I don't get back in there...

She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford 
gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees 
something out there.

MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods 
and down toward the house is a teenage boy.

               KATIE (O.S.)
     You're the doctor, aren't you?

Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter 
KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt 
are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.

               MUMFORD
     You must be Katie. People call me 
     Doc.

               KATIE
          (motioning urgently)
     C'mere. Quick... c'mon!

Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the 
porch.

INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance. 
Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one 
of two facing doors and waits for him.

When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for 
safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in 
closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is 
packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons 
that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless 
move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing 
door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was 
once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of 
cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.

Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks 
in a hypnotic WHISPER --

               KATIE
     Cuddledown... Linen & Lace... Scully 
     & Scully... Smith & Hawken... Plow & 
     Hearth... Museum of Modern Art... 
     Smithsonian Museum... J. Crew... 
     Wolferman's... Hold Everything... 
     Nieman Marcus... Coldwater Creek... 
     Garnett Hill... Norm Thompson... 
     Victoria's Secret... Sharper Image... 
     Hammacher Schlemmer...

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN, 
Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up 
onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket 
with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-
Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but 
properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.

               MARTIN
     Is this him?

               KATIE
          (nods)
     I showed him.

               MARTIN
          (to Mumford)
     Do you get it now? This is no joke.

Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly, 
their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that 
Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has 
come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late 
arrival.

               JEREMY
     Hey, kids. Oh, hi.

Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his 
hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his 
Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --

               JEREMY
     You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. 
     Jeremy Brockett.

               MUMFORD
     Doc. Nice to meet you.

               JEREMY
     Sorry I'm late... traffic was a 
     motherfucker. Have another drink, 
     I'll be back in five.

Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with 
each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT

LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda 
carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish 
and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, 
who immediately gets up.

               ALTHEA
     I'll be back.

She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy 
makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --

               JEREMY
     I think you'll like this. Know much 
     about Cuban cigars?

               MUMFORD
     Nope.

Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere 
pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of 
smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.

               JEREMY
     Makes the whole thing that much 
     better.

Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He 
gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to 
light up --

               JEREMY
     Just hold the flame a little bit 
     below the end... that's it... now 
     just turn it slowly as you draw...

Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.

               JEREMY
     Are you a man who likes to treat 
     himself right?

               MUMFORD
     I've had my moments.

               JEREMY
     I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. 
     Nobody ever said on their death bed -- 
     "I treated myself too well."

               MUMFORD
     I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, 
     "I should have spent more time at 
     the office."

               JEREMY
     Fill in the blank. I don't mind the 
     office. The point is, you only go 
     'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be 
     here now.

               MUMFORD
     What do you do?

               JEREMY
     Althea hasn't told you?

               MUMFORD
          (no)
     We've been talking about her, mostly.

               JEREMY
     Well, in '85 four of us left our 
     firms and formed an investment banking 
     venture. We've got twenty-three people 
     working there now.

               MUMFORD
     You've done well.

The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-
satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight 
mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate 
surroundings--

               JEREMY
     We've done... very well. You know 
     anything about addiction, Doc?

               MUMFORD
     A little.

               JEREMY
     Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say 
     when you're in the red zone, you 
     gotta score.
          (watches Mumford smoke)
     So what do you think?

               MUMFORD
     Tastes good.

               JEREMY
     No... I mean about Althea. About 
     her...
          (makes a face)
     ...behavior. Do you think you can 
     fix her up?

               MUMFORD
     What do you think's wrong with her?

               JEREMY
     She's gone weird is what's wrong 
     with her. Out of control. Probably 
     from living out here in Mayberry.

Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a 
mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, 
fascinated by this guy.

               JEREMY
     You're the doctor, what do you think?

               MUMFORD
     She seems very unhappy.

Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."

               JEREMY
     I think we all knew that, professor. 
     The question... the real --
          (drawn out, stoned)
     -- quest-tio-nee... is... why?

Mumford looks at him a long time.

EXT. ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT

Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve.

INT. BROCKETT'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Martin is driving Mumford back to town.

               MARTIN
     But you know how to drive?

               MUMFORD
     Sure.

               MARTIN
     Got a license?
          (yes)
     But no car?

               MUMFORD
     Don't need it.

               MARTIN
     I just got my license two weeks ago.

               MUMFORD
     You're good.

               MARTIN
     I been drivin' since I was twelve.

               MUMFORD
     That would explain it.

               MARTIN
     Can you help Mom?

               MUMFORD
     I'm trying.

               MARTIN
          (intense)
     Got to.

They drive in silence for a bit. Then --

               MARTIN
     Nessa Watkins... She comes to you, 
     doesn't she? You're treating her, 
     right?

Mumford gives him a surprised look, then acknowledges it.

               MARTIN
     What's wrong with her?

               MUMFORD
     Is she a friend of yours?

               MARTIN
     No... sort of. Man, she could be 
     cool, but all she does is get wrecked 
     and do all the guys. She's blowin' 
     them in the parking lot.

Mumford knew that.

               MARTIN
     A person's got to hate themselves to 
     act like that.

Mumford regards Martin with respect, then turns to look out 
front. After a few moments --

               MARTIN
     Have you ever met a bigger shithead 
     than my stepfather?

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford 
gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his 
paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the 
clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs 
the dog's head.

               LILY
     Ainge!

               MARTIN
     That's okay. Jeremy won't mind. Good 
     dog.

               LILY
     Ainge!

The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily. 
Mumford waves as Martin pulls away.

               LILY
          (to Ainge)
     Do we run into the street? No, I 
     didn't think so.
          (looks after Martin)
     Nice car. How's that place?

               MUMFORD
     It's a pretty piece of land.

They walk up the block with the dog.

               LILY
     And the Brocketts?

               MUMFORD
     Horror show. What'd you do tonight?

               LILY
     It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call 
     in the National Guard.
          (he nods)
     Then I did my laundry... watched 
     20/20.

               MUMFORD
     ...And?

               LILY
     Shocking. Did you know the government 
     is wasteful?
          (Mumford reacts)
     You heard it here first. Oh, and 
     being a supermodel... it's no walk 
     in the park.

               MUMFORD
     Why do you watch?

               LILY
     No gentleman caller, Doc.
          (they turn back)
     Not that I care. I've had it with 
     men. They're so fascinated by their 
     own crap. Took me four years to get 
     the last one out. Almost turned me 
     into a dyke... These days my idea of 
     a hot date is a long shower by myself 
     before bed. Now that feels good. And 
     you don't have to do all that... 
     listening.

Mumford laughs.

               LILY
     Oops... sorry. I guess that's the 
     story of your life.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN. A health information "library" 
website has been called up on Mumford's office computer. 
Right now it's beginning to spew information about "CHRONIC 
FATIGUE SYNDROME" -- Definitions, Signs and Symptoms, 
Diagnostic Measures, etc.

Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His 
printer is churning out hard copies.

EXT. FRONT PORCH, COOK HOUSE - DAY

Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie. 
He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively.

               SOFIE
     I'm not making any promises.

               MUMFORD
     We'll turn back anytime you want.

               SOFIE
          (seeing something)
     Oh boy... this should be interesting.

Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties 
is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling, 
as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK.

               SOFIE
     Hello, Mother. I want you to meet 
     Dr. Mumford.

               MRS. COOK
     Mumford... like the town?

               MUMFORD
          (offering his hand)
     Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. 
     Cook.

She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly.

               MRS. COOK
     What's happening here?

               SOFIE
     We're going for a walk.

               MRS. COOK
     Do you think that's a good idea?

               SOFIE
     Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself 
     completely in his hands. For today, 
     anyway.

               MRS. COOK
     What kind of doctor are you?

               MUMFORD
     Ph.D., psychologist.

               MRS. COOK
     Oh... not a real doctor.

               MUMFORD
     That's right, the fake kind.

Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford.

               SOFIE
     We'd better go or I'm liable to bail 
     on the whole thing.

Mrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk.

EXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY

Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In 
the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going 
inside.

               SOFIE
     Mom's such a cutie.

               MUMFORD
     People usually have to get to know 
     me before they hate me.

               SOFIE
     She's not in a bad mood. She's like 
     that all the time.
          (a beat)
     It doesn't bother me anymore. It's 
     my dad and my brother I worry about.

               MUMFORD
     Maybe... but you're the one whose 
     ass is dragging.

               SOFIE
          (laughs)
     Is that the technical description of 
     what I've got?

               MUMFORD
     Is she against you getting help?

               SOFIE
     We don't discuss it.

               MUMFORD
     Something's bothering her.

               SOFIE
     Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, 
     especially, but Dad, of course. She 
     thinks my brother's all right, but 
     she didn't expect much. It's what 
     happens when you "marry beneath 
     yourself"...

Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.

               MUMFORD
     Please... forgive me.

               SOFIE
     What?

               MUMFORD
     Negative thinking makes everything 
     more difficult. If you're going to 
     have enough strength to do this, we 
     have to talk only about positive 
     things. All right?

She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny. 
But she agrees.

               MUMFORD
     Okay then... Are you positive your 
     mother's a bitch?
          (she laughs, surprised)
     Just kidding.

               SOFIE
     You've got a funny idea of funny.

               MUMFORD
          (seems worried)
     I've offended you!

               SOFIE
     No.

               MUMFORD
     Really? What would it take?

She laughs again; surprised again. He's got her off balance 
makes a "rim shot" sound.

               SOFIE
     Is this the treatment?

               MUMFORD
     Sorry... I'm done.

               SOFIE
     'Cause I'll tell you, none of the 
     others have tried this approach.

They've come to the corner. He gestures to ask -- "shall we 
cross?" She considers for quite a while, gauging her strength, 
then, still on his arm, steps off the curb --

               SOFIE
          (absurdly unconvincing)
     Hey, 'Just do it!'

THEY CROSS OUT OF FRAME as we HEAR:

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     I want you to tell me all your 
     symptoms.

EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems more 
vigorous.

               SOFIE
     I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.

               MUMFORD
     Be specific.

               SOFIE
     Well... I'm tired all the time, 
     obviously. I always feel like taking 
     a nap. But when I try to sleep, I 
     have trouble.
          (Mumford nods)
     My muscles ache. And my joints. I 
     feel like an old person, or like I 
     did back when I used to work out too 
     hard... What else?...

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. Under the list of Signs and 
Symptoms: "Sore throat."

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Sore throat?

               SOFIE (V.O.)
     Uh-huh.

ON THE SCREEN: "Low grade fever... Painful lymph glands... 
Irritability..."

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Low grade fever?

EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

Sofie nods.

               MUMFORD
     Painful lymph glands?
          (yes)
     Forget fulness... irritability... 
     depression?

               SOFIE
     Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... 
     I get confused.

               MUMFORD
     Yeah, most people have that. It's 
     confusing here.

               SOFIE
     Where?

               MUMFORD
     Life.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest 
set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist 
bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's 
got.

               SOFIE
     I don't know if I mentioned the 
     headaches.

               MUMFORD
     Did you get headaches before this?
          (Sofie: yes)
     But you get more now? Or more severe?

               SOFIE
     No, not really. They're about the 
     same. My marriage was one long 
     headache.

               MUMFORD
     So the headaches may not even be a 
     part of this?

She considers that, reluctantly agrees.

               MUMFORD
     I can give myself a headache 
     instantly.

               SOFIE
     Is that like a party trick?

               MUMFORD
     All I have to do is have two 
     conflicting thoughts at the same 
     time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking 
     these walks is going to help Sofie 
     get better.' But then I'll also think -- 
     'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these 
     walks and you're kidding yourself 
     about the benefits.'

Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.

               MUMFORD
     There... I've given myself a real 
     whopper.

               SOFIE
     You actually address yourself by 
     name in your thoughts?
          (Mumford laughs)
     So you really think having two 
     opposing ideas in your head does 
     some kind of damage?

               MUMFORD
     Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two 
     different directions at once. It 
     makes tiny little tears in our fabric.

               SOFIE
     Well then, my life has been some 
     kind of huge rip.

INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY

The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the 
steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel 
thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the 
second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's 
fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.]

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     The town was a rube's heaven, but I 
     found work my first day out down at 
     Old Man Sutter's gas station and 
     diner. I knew his stacked young wife 
     was going to be a problem, but, hey, 
     life is full of problems. Back at 
     the boarding house, I was washing up 
     when I heard a load of yellin' and --

IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 
17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up 
the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down 
at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey:

               LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER
     ...get off my case! You don't like 
     any of my friends...

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     ...I got my first look at the 
     landlady's daughter.

The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer 
watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives 
him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and 
goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her 
door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The 
Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a 
view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. 
In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off 
the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     Lucky for me, she was plenty upset 
     but not too careful.

Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's 
Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip 
begins to curl.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     Or maybe it wasn't an accident at 
     all --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Mr. Follett.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     -- 'cause in that instant I saw the 
     beginning of a vixen's smile and I 
     knew --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Henry!

Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, 
cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into 
his mirror -- it suddenly shatters.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward 
Mumford, agitated.

               FOLLETT
     What?

               MUMFORD
     Stop now.

               FOLLETT
     Why? I'm paying for this.

               MUMFORD
     Not for this. Not me, you're not.

               FOLLETT
          (challenging)
     You find it distasteful, don't you?

               MUMFORD
     It doesn't matter how I feel about 
     it. It's how you feel about it that 
     matters.

               FOLLETT
     I enjoy it. Does that make me some 
     kind of pervert? Just because a man 
     has a rich imaginative life --

               MUMFORD
     You didn't come to me because you 
     have a rich imagination.

               FOLLETT
     No?

               MUMFORD
     You came because it's taking over. 
     You're in its grip.

               FOLLETT
     I never said that.

Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel.

               MUMFORD
     Where's your wife, Henry?

Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking.

               MUMFORD
     Where's your wife, Henry?

               FOLLETT
     Go to hell.

               MUMFORD
          (softer)
     I didn't hear you.

Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until --

               FOLLETT
     We got divorced.
          (petulant)
     I had to get rid of her. She couldn't 
     satisfy me.

               MUMFORD
          (shouts, Follett jumps)
     What?!

Follett seems to shrink in size. They've been here before 
and he doesn't like it.

               FOLLETT
          (softly)
     I was... never satisfied.

               MUMFORD
          (normal again)
     Now we're back on track.

Again, Follett says something under his breath.

               MUMFORD
     What's that?

               FOLLETT
          (long beat)
     You are so mean.

EXT. HIKING TRAIL - MAGIC

Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He 
comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting 
for him, looking serious.

               MUMFORD
     Hey, Skip.

               SKIP
     Doc. I know we're not supposed to 
     get together till Wednesday...

               MUMFORD
     That's all right. What's on your 
     mind?

Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail.

               SKIP
     How many sessions have we had now, 
     Doc?
          (Mumford tries to 
               remember)
     Six. And it's been good... like we 
     were two buddies hanging out. Just 
     shootin' the shit.

               MUMFORD
     Yep.

They walk in silence for a while.

               SKIP
     This is really hard. Everything I 
     want to say is hard...

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big 
rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of 
Mumford.

               SKIP
     ...We're like friends, almost... who 
     trust each other.

He checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water, 
who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig.

               SKIP
     I want to tell you something, Doc, 
     but before I do, I need to ask you a 
     question... Because, for me to tell 
     you this thing -- well, I haven't 
     told anybody about this. It's the 
     biggest secret I've got.

               MUMFORD
     Sometimes it's best to keep a few 
     things just for ourselves.

               SKIP
     You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I 
     supposed to be able to tell you 
     everything?

               MUMFORD
     It's just a thought.

Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.

               SKIP
     That really relates to the thing I 
     want to ask you... I've noticed that 
     sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, 
     when we're hanging out, throwin' the 
     ball... or that time we went 
     bowling... sometimes you'll like --
          (gets it out fast --)
     -- tell me things about your other 
     patients.

Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it 
silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.

               SKIP
     Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't 
     know all that much about psychology 
     or therapy or... ethics, so maybe 
     there's something I missed... or 
     something...

               MUMFORD
     You're concerned that maybe I can't 
     be trusted with a secret.

               SKIP
     I trust you. Definitely. No question. 
     But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I 
     mean, you're not supposed to tell 
     anyone about your patients' 
     problems... are you?

Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment.

               MUMFORD
     That is correct, Skip. I'm going to 
     have to take a long look at that.

The conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where 
to go next. Finally --

               SKIP
     Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell 
     you --

               MUMFORD
     -- Skip. Knowing what you do about 
     me --

               SKIP
     Doc, I trust you! You've listened to 
     me better than anybody... maybe ever.
          (leans in, intense)
     And this secret I've got, I can't 
     stand it anymore. I don't know if 
     I'm some kind of --

Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly 
there's no one around.

               SKIP
     -- I don't know if I'm a pervert or 
     what. It's taken me this long to get 
     where I can come out and say it... I 
     can't back away now. I can't spend 
     another day not knowing if I'm nuts.

Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.

               SKIP
     All right, I'm just gonna tell you, 
     as simple and direct as I can.
          (one last spasm of 
               doubt)
     And you understand that this is a 
     big secret? Just between us?
          (Mumford does)
     Okay. You know I've got this gift 
     for certain kinds of... machines.

               MUMFORD
     You are Panda, monarch of modems.

               SKIP
     That's right. And you also know that 
     even though I make 23% of the modems 
     in the world... I cannot make one 
     simple connection with any woman who 
     could truly love me.

               MUMFORD
     Okay... let's say that, for now.

               SKIP
     It's true, believe me. So... do you 
     know what I've been doing, all alone, 
     in my workshop, for almost two 
     years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill-
     It. How I spend my every solitary 
     hour?

Mumford shakes his head, "no."

               SKIP
     Guess.
          (Mumford demurs)
     Go ahead, guess!

               MUMFORD
          (if he must)
     Jerking off?

               SKIP
     No!... Although that's a good guess. 
     No, what I've been working on, what 
     the world really needs and no one 
     has been able to create --
          (leans in, whispering)
     -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, 
     gender-specific, anatomically 
     functional... sexual surrogate slash 
     companion.

Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally --

               MUMFORD
     Slash what?

               SKIP
     Sexual surrogate... slash... 
     companion.

               MUMFORD
     A doll?

               SKIP
     No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm 
     talking about much, much more than a 
     doll. The world has never seen what 
     I'm talking about... except maybe in 
     the movies.

Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun 
finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip.

               MUMFORD
     How's it coming?

               SKIP
     You don't think I'm insane?

               MUMFORD
          ("no")
     And that's your secret?
          (Skip: "yes")
     You meant -- like a trade secret?

               SKIP
     No, Doc, a private secret! It's 
     perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- 
     Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?

               MUMFORD
     Sounds like kind of a good idea.

               SKIP
          (nonplussed)
     Really?

               MUMFORD
     Definitely.

It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and 
takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps 
carefully over his head.

               MUMFORD
     Skip, that's not much of a secret.

               SKIP
          (hurt)
     It's not?

               MUMFORD
     Oh, it's okay. It's just not something 
     to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't 
     want people knowing -- and believe 
     me, it's safe with me -- but on the 
     scale of dirty little secrets, I'd 
     give it, say... a two.

Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the 
dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.

               MUMFORD
     You want to know a secret? I'll tell 
     you a secret. Since it's just between 
     us and all...

Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.

               MUMFORD
     The secret, Skip, is this -- I am 
     not now, nor have I ever been... a 
     psychologist.

At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the 
huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard 
right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets 
up.

               MUMFORD
     We'd better get going. Just follow 
     my light. And, Skip, watch your step.

EXT. MUMFORD'S PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

This porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip 
sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's 
legs are propped up on the porch railing

               SKIP
     Who else knows?

               MUMFORD
     Just you.

               SKIP
     It's time you did some talkin', Dr. 
     Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your 
     name, isn't it?

Mumford takes a drink of beer.

               SKIP
     Damn! What is your name?

               MUMFORD
     Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.

               SKIP
     It matters to me.

Mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do."

               SKIP
     I've told you a lot of private stuff.

               MUMFORD
     I can tell you anything else.

               SKIP
     What about everything? How did this 
     happen?

Mumford looks at Skip, considering. He takes a long pull 
from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle.

               MUMFORD
     Did you know that every species of 
     mammal has found some way to drug, 
     inebriate, or anestnetize itself? 
     Even if it's just banging its head 
     against a rock. Seems to be some 
     natural urge... to get away for a 
     while.
          (one more look at 
               Skip)
     I've had it for as long as I can 
     remember. The first place I wanted 
     out of was home...

AS MUMFORD TALKS we SEE IMAGES FROM HIS PAST, all FROM 
MUMFORD'S POV. We do not see him in the scenes. Instead, 
everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD, 
even if they're just ignoring him.

EXT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME, BALD KNOB, WEST VIRGINIA - 
MAGIC

MOVING FAST (MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD POV) toward the back door 
of a rundown, little house in a poor mining community. We 
reach the back door and bang inside --

INT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME - MAGIC

The cramped interior is grimy and depressing. MUMFORD'S MOTHER 
worse for wear, has just put a glass of liquor on the sink 
and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop. She 
glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly 
drunk. Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE 
FRONT DOOR which is opened roughly by MUMFORD'S FATHER, a 
coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work. But 
it's his scary scowl that impresses. His eyes take in his 
wife (and her drink) but he says nothing. He barely gives 
Mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and 
disappears into another room.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I thought I had the best parents in 
     Bald Knob, West Virginia... till I 
     was seven years old and got a look 
     at some others. They weren't bad 
     folks...

AT THE DINNER TABLE. Across the table, MUMFORD'S OLDER SISTER 
eats with her head down. On the right, Mumford's Mother is 
picking at her food. Mumford's POV shifts to his Father, who 
is yelling something at his wife.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...but they were real unhappy about 
     being who they were...

Now, his Father looks suddenly at Mumford; his hand shoots 
out to slap Mumford's face, and the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then 
immediately FADES UP AGAIN on --

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

TIGHT ON A TEST PAPER being laid on an old-fashioned student 
desk. Scrawled in red pencil at the top: "A -- Outstanding!"

TILT UP to the old classroom, full of kids getting their 
tests back. ACROSS THE AISLE, looking at camera with disgust, 
is a sixteen year old boy, MUMFORD'S CLASSMATE.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     It made no sense that school came 
     easy for me... I didn't do much work, 
     and there was a proud tradition in 
     my family of being really dumb. My 
     friends didn't like it much. It made 
     them distrust me...

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

FROM INSIDE A HELMET: the brutal chaos of crashing bodies in 
a Friday night high school football game. Mumford is violently 
hit. Our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that 
again the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then quickly FADES UP AGAIN on --

INT./EXT. LOVER'S LANE, WOODS - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A CAN OF "IRON CITY" BEER in MUMFORD'S POV as he 
puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into 
the back seat. In the shadows is a teen-age girl, MUMFORD'S 
DATE. As Mumford moves toward her, she flames a Bic lighter 
and gleefully lights a fat joint; her blouse is unbuttoned 
and gaping.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     On the other hand, it made some of 
     my classmates like me better... I 
     don't know what it was in me, maybe 
     some genes from my mom, maybe some 
     discomfort with myself, but early on 
     I was drawn to any substance that 
     made me numb...

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Graduation Ceremonies. MUMFORD'S POV moving across a platform 
toward the diploma being proffered by the PRINCIPAL. PAN TO 
Mumford's Parents, dressed up and proud, in the audience.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     When I got a scholarship to go out 
     of state to college, I was the first 
     one in my extended family who'd gone 
     beyond high school. At graduation, 
     my folks looked like a normal, happy 
     couple, which I guess they were about 
     10% of the time... out in public.

INT. UNIVERSITY DORMITORY HALLWAY - DAY

TIGHT ON A DORM ROOM DOOR as it is pushed open. MUMFORD'S 
NEW ROOMMATE, a crazed, middle-class doper, has his stuff 
spread around and is settled in the midst of the chaos. He 
looks up at the arriving Mumford with a maniacal, stoned 
smile.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     My roommate was from a planet I had 
     never heard of called Scarsdale, 
     where everything was the opposite of 
     West Virginia...

INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A BONG filling with white smoke. We FOLLOW IT UP 
THE TUBE to a PRETTY COED, who inhales deeply, then blows a 
seductive cloud directly at Mumford. The room is full of 
partying students.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     All the other kids, in fact, seemed 
     to know things I didn't. They were 
     friendly enough, but in four years, 
     I never got over feeling that I had 
     sneaked in... and was about to be 
     exposed as the hillbilly and imposter 
     I actually was.

INT. BEDROOM, STUDENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Funky decor, red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow. 
MUMFORD'S POV moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a 
sheet on the bed. He reaches out and lifts the edge to REVEAL 
the Pretty Coed, now naked, giggling, her extended hand 
offering a tab of acid right up to camera.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     The thing that always made those 
     feelings go away was... fun. Fun was 
     drugs, fun was sex, fun was 
     aggressively doing nothing. The only 
     problem I had with degenerate, self-
     destructive behavior was... I couldn't 
     get enough of it.

INT. UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - DAY

A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination 
on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford 
is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination 
paper keeps changing shape.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     All that fun eventually had an impact 
     on the work I was doing. I figured, 
     what the hell, it was only college, 
     after all. I'd straighten up when I 
     went out in the real world...

INT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into 
Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward 
camera as we dip down toward the stream of water.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I didn't want to jump into my career 
     right out of college. And since I 
     had no career, that turned out to be 
     not much of a problem...

MUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the 
endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin 
TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A 
Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I had a series of challenging jobs 
     over the next few years...

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage 
containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM.

INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

TIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP 
AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off 
the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON 
is waiting impatiently out by the pumps.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently.

               MUMFORD
     ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, 
     pest control... lots of jobs that 
     started with the letter "p". For 
     some reason, I kept losing these 
     jobs.
          (takes a swig of beer)
     The only mind-altering substance I 
     never had a problem with was alcohol. 
     I never got drunk. I didn't like the 
     feeling. But really, when you're as 
     fucked up as I was... big deal.

Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing 
facing Skip.

               MUMFORD
     Eventually, doing all these different 
     jobs, I noticed something. For some 
     reason, probably because I was too 
     stoned to talk, everywhere I went --

INT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS

We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The 
environments are radically different, but the activity is 
always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his 
heart out to camera.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     -- people would talk to me, tell me 
     everything... their stories, their 
     problems, their innermost thoughts. 
     Sometimes they'd pretend they needed 
     advice, but mostly people just wanted 
     someone to listen.

INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY

MUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an 
insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Anyway, one day I was spraying for 
     termites when I had a vision --

The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders 
comes rushing out toward camera.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     -- it was time to put my college 
     degree to work and get a job with a 
     desk.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY

FROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I took the civil service exam and 
     found myself working at the Internal 
     Revenue Service, District 14, Central 
     Administrative Office. I started off 
     as a general records clerk...

SERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper 
files being pulled, documents being routed.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I guess the standards weren't too 
     high there, because my superiors got 
     excited and pushed me to take the 
     advancement tests...

INT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT

An intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera 
(Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the 
basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     One guy in particular thought I should 
     be a Revenue Officer. There was more 
     money to be made as your 
     classification went up. Which had a 
     lot of appeal to me...

INT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT

A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut 
in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across 
the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...since, even though I was certain 
     I could stop anytime I wanted, I had 
     developed a real affection for 
     cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I 
     had ever had.

INT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking 
at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE 
OFFICER, who remains unruffled --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue 
     Officer, where you were face to face 
     abusing -- and getting abused -- all 
     day long...

His POV PANS with a couple of intense COLLECTION AGENTS who 
pass behind the first scene on their way out of the offices.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...And being a Collection Agent was 
     definitely not in my genetic make-
     up...

His POV STOPS, letting the Collection Agents go, on another 
fellow, with the disreputable, cocksure demeanor of a private 
dick, who is lolling near the water cooler, watching the 
altercation with amusement. He is GREGORY, an IRS 
INVESTIGATOR.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     But there was one job that looked 
     like it might be fun -- Investigator.

               SKIP (V.O.)
     Are you telling me your last job 
     before becoming a psychologist was --

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

BACK TO PRESENT. Skip is leaning intensely toward Mumford.

               SKIP
     -- an investigator for the Internal 
     Revenue Service?

               MUMFORD
     Everybody has a story, Skip.

               SKIP
     Sounds like you have several.

               MUMFORD
     What it felt like was... a series of 
     separate, unconnected lives -- 
     hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, 
     garbage man, civil service guy...
          (Yul Brynner accent)
     ...et cetera... et cetera. Every 
     time I'd leave a life, it felt good. 
     Whatever problems I was having were 
     suddenly gone. I had no friends and 
     I didn't talk to my family. The only 
     constant, stabilizing force in my 
     life was... drugs.

               SKIP
     An IRS investigator with a drug 
     problem?

               MUMFORD
     It wasn't the best situation.

               SKIP
     Did you carry a gun?

               MUMFORD
     Didn't need one. We didn't even need 
     a warrant for most of the shit we 
     did. Man, the IRS... we could go in 
     your bank account, your credit 
     cards... hell, we used to go into 
     doctors' files and get all the juicy 
     details. Nobody wants to argue with 
     the IRS.

EXT. ALLEY, REAR OF DRY CLEANING FACILITY - MAGIC

MOVING POV as Mumford follows GREGORY down the gloomy alley 
to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     I got teamed with one of the top 
     guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He 
     always got his man, whether they 
     deserved it or not. He was a "closer" 
     and everybody admired that...

WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow, 
is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian 
employees in cash as they leave.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     He'd make the case and the Collection 
     guys would come in and clean up. Our 
     specialty was... sleazy skulking...

Gregory turns to look at camera (Mumford) with a devilish 
grin.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     We were a good team. I was a dope 
     addict and Gregory was insane.

INT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUMFORD'S POV as he supports a drunken Gregory as they stagger 
down the sidewalk to a row house. Holding Gregory up on the 
other side, is CANDY, Gregory's pretty wife. They wrangle 
Gregory up the front steps. Gregory stumbles inside and 
Mumford retreats down the steps, his eyes still on the front 
door. Candy appears there and stares down at Mumford, who 
stops where he is.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Of course, him being insane didn't 
     make it all right that I fell in 
     love with his wife.

               SKIP (V.O.)
     Holy shit!

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head, 
astounded.

               MUMFORD
          (announcer-like)
     "Get to know your therapist."

               SKIP
     You were messed up, man.

               MUMFORD
          (dry)
     But look at me now...

               SKIP
     Hey, you've done good. Look at 
     yourself... you've cleaned up, you've 
     got a career --

Skip stops, remembers the truth, realizes. Mumford smiles.

               SKIP
     At least you pulled yourself out...

               MUMFORD
     Things got a lot worse.

               SKIP
     You and Candy...?

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV from his bed. Candy finishes dressing across 
the room. She looks at camera, her face full of the pain of 
leaving.

EXT. FIRESCAPE/ROOF, BUILDING IN CITY - DAY

MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto 
the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial 
neighborhood.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     The way the District Managers got 
     ahead and won their bonuses was by 
     generating maximum payments. That 
     meant the revenue officers had to 
     use all their "collection tools" -- 
     seizures, liens, levies -- even if a 
     more reasonable compromise could 
     have been worked out. The best way 
     to reduce resistance from the 
     taxpayers was to build a convincing 
     case -- whether there'd actually 
     been a violation or not...

Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof 
and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small 
furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the 
loading dock.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     That's where we came in. Our DM was 
     a particular sonuvabitch, and he 
     knew just how to get Gregory crazy.

INT. ETHNIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT

MUMFORD'S POV takes in his ATTRACTIVE DATE next to him, then 
PANS TO Candy and Gregory across the table. Everybody's 
laughing. Candy flashes Mumford a momentary special look. 
MUMFORD'S POV guiltily PANS TO Gregory. Did he see it?

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     So several things were working on 
     Gregory when we started building a 
     case against a furniture maker named 
     Edmond Worrell...

EXT. PARKING LOT, FURNITURE FACTORY - MAGIC

BINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they 
get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...and his family.

INT. BUSINESS OFFICE, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT

Lit by powerful flashlights, Gregory and Mumford attack the 
files of the company, both in cabinets and on computer.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Gregory was acting more and more 
     irrational. We started doing things 
     that were over the line even for the 
     IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm 
     sure Gregory must have known about 
     Candy and me. On our team, I had 
     become...

INT. MEN'S ROOM, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet 
tank as it is sucked out of sight.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...the responsible one.

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV IS A BLURRY SHAPE until Candy moves up and 
away, her face sweaty and aroused, torso naked. She's on top 
of Mumford.

INT. GOVERNMENT CAR - DAY

Mumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is 
already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a 
long time.

INT. CORRIDOR, SHABBY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Mumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down 
the hall. They reach a door with the painted sign: "SAMUEL 
GORBECK, C.P.A."

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Sometimes when a case didn't work 
     out right, Gregory and this Revenue 
     Officer named McLure would put the 
     squeeze on the subject's accountant...

As they start to enter, SOFT CUT TO:

INT. GORBECK'S INNER OFFICE - DAY

GORBECK listens, intimidated by McLure, who sits on the 
accountant's desk, and Gregory, who is moving around the 
office -- snooping.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     There aren't many accountants who 
     don't have something to worry about 
     with the Service...

INT. IRS OFFICES - DAY

Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, 
WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are 
ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some 
other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford. 
Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford 
to join them.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     The parties met repeatedly over a 
     period of months. The IRS offered to 
     settle for a sizable but, they said, 
     fair amount. Worrell said he'd done 
     nothing wrong and threatened to fight 
     it all the way to Washington. He 
     seemed pretty strong. I was secretly 
     pulling for him. McLure and the 
     District Manager stepped up the 
     pressure.

EXT. PARKING LOT, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY

MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as 
it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing 
Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's 
car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     What none of us down at the Service 
     knew was that Edmond Worrell had a 
     story too... Worrell's was that he'd 
     been fighting chronic depression for 
     thirty years. Under the heat of the 
     investigation, he fell off his 
     medication. One Tuesday morning, he 
     went down to the factory early, wrote 
     his family a letter, then used the 
     9mm automatic they kept there to 
     kill himself... The DM dropped the 
     case that day and started proceedings 
     to get rid of Gregory...

The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO:

EXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT

Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens 
before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, 
comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Gregory went home drunk, beat up 
     Candy and went out to drink some 
     more. Candy told me she didn't want 
     to see me again. She hated us both 
     and she was leaving us both... It 
     made perfect sense to me. I felt the 
     same way...

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined 
drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the 
clothes out of a drawer.

INT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mumford looks desperately through the pill bottles and 
detritus in his squalid medicine cabinet.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...In fact, I was jealous of Candy. 
     I wanted to leave too, just like 
     her... get as far away from --

Giving up, Mumford slams the medicine cabinet shut and FOR 
THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS STORY BEGAN, WE SEE MUMFORD in his 
previous incarnation. And this is probably as bad as he ever 
looked. He stares at his image in the mirror.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     -- me... as possible.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Skip is staring at Mumford. Empty beer bottles are lined up 
on the porch railing.

               SKIP
     And so you did...

Mumford nods.

               SKIP
     And the drugs?

               MUMFORD
     Harder than I thought. Took me three 
     tries. But I was highly motivated -- 
     figured there was no point in leaving 
     me and taking that along. After two 
     bomb-outs, I found a place in the 
     desert...

INT. DESERT DRUG REHAB CENTER - SUNRISE

A venetian blind is raised, revealing sunrise over a desert 
landscape.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run 
     by an order of monks -- but it worked. 
     When I got out of there, I was just 
     about broke...

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door.

               MUMFORD
     ...which seemed perfect for starting 
     something new. Be back.

Mumford goes inside. Skip sits listening to the night. From 
downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he HEARS A SHOWER GO ON. 
Mumford comes back out.

               SKIP
     Somebody's taking a shower down there.

               MUMFORD
     That'd be Lily.

               SKIP
     I wish I could live in the shower. 
     I'd take five a day if I had the 
     time. I went to this spa in Germany, 
     a sanitarium practically, up on this 
     mountain. And the great thing -- 
     they just kept you wet all day.

               MUMFORD
     Who'd you go with?
          (Skip: "alone")
     That's not good.

               SKIP
     How'd you do it?
          (Mumford is confused)
     The new you.

               MUMFORD
     You know how easy it is. A kid can 
     manage it if he wants a fake I.D. 
     You can do practically the whole 
     deal at your local Kinko's. The only 
     variable is how much pride you take 
     in the product.

               SKIP
     I know it starts with a birth 
     certificate...

               MUMFORD
     All new people start with that...

INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating 
the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already 
bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State 
of West Virginia".

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     With desktop publishing, you don't 
     have to deal with printers, supply 
     houses, or pesky government agencies. 
     Eventually you do have to get your 
     hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one 
     of those, Skip?

As the border is completed, we PUSH IN and DISSOLVE THROUGH 
TO:

SURFACE OF A DESK, with an electric Smith-Corona typewriter 
(late '50's vintage). EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the keys hammering 
out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending 
physician.

               SKIP (V.O.)
          (playing along)
     Is that like a mimeograph?... What 
     about the name?

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford looks at Skip.

               MUMFORD
     What about it?

               SKIP
     "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the 
     name of the town you were going to?

               MUMFORD
     Oh. You got it backwards. I already 
     had the name when I started looking 
     for somewhere to settle. When I saw 
     this town on a map, I thought maybe 
     it was a sign. See...

INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

The typewriter is just pounding out: MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O-
R-D.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's 
     kindergarten class with me. He was 
     killed with his parents in a wreck 
     on their way back from a Steelers 
     game. He was only six years old, 
     which is a real plus, so there's a 
     birth certificate if anyone checks -- 
     but not much else. They died in 
     Pennsylvania, so there's no death 
     certificate in West Virginia... that's 
     also good.

ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled 
out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow 
bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). The paper has 
taken on an aged, sepia look. CUT TO:

A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom 
book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been 
folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then 
refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's 
starting to look old.

               SKIP (V.O.)
     And a birth certificate is enough?

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Everything flows from that, and what 
     doesn't... can be easily purchased.

SERIES OF SHOTS of Mumford's DOCUMENTATION PILING UP. A post 
office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is 
opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security 
card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas, 
license and accreditation to operate as a therapist.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     Of course, my IRS training made it 
     easier. Once you've done that, there's 
     not much data you can't access and 
     use any way you want.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

               MUMFORD
     In a free society, you are who you 
     say you are.
          (smiling)
     People should remember that before 
     they go around knocking this country.
          (he gets up)
     Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy.

Skip looks upset.

               SKIP
     But you studied psychology, right? 
     You did the training and just never 
     got the degree?

               MUMFORD
     No... no training.

               SKIP
          (hopeful)
     Psych major?

               MUMFORD
     English Lit.

               SKIP
     Jeez, man. But you're good at it!

               MUMFORD
     I understand what it's like to want 
     to leave a problem behind. That's 
     all most people are looking to do.
          (shrugs)
     Mainly, I listen.

He heads inside.

               SKIP
     Where ya going? I've got a million 
     questions.

               MUMFORD
     See you Thursday... regular time.

Mumford goes inside. Skip nods, head spinning.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE

Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first 
light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around 
his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, 
then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with 
varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is 
tiring for her, but she's committed.

               SOFIE
     ...so we get on this incredible steam 
     engine train that runs up into the 
     mountains...
          (she tosses a paper, 
               grunting)
     ...and this trip is everything it's 
     cracked up to be... an open car, 
     great views, the mountain air blowing 
     through. We're sitting there, married 
     for six years, and he says how he 
     likes it better when I put my hair 
     back...

Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all 
her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, 
who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.

               SOFIE
     That wasn't so good.

Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips 
the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue --

               MUMFORD
     You're doing great.

               SOFIE
     I don't know if I'm going to make it 
     the whole way.

               MUMFORD
     It doesn't matter. Go on.

               SOFIE
     Oh... this makes me sound irrational, 
     which is probably right, but there 
     was something about him saying this -- 
     it was maybe the millionth time he'd 
     told me about some preference of 
     his. Well, I was so... tired of it.
          (memories)
     Seems like my whole life someone's 
     been telling me... I'm just not 
     getting it right. Can we rest for a 
     second?

She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, 
breathing hard.

               SOFIE
     You're purposely making me talk while 
     we do this...
          (Mumford nods)
     ...because you think this is good 
     for me...
          (nods again)
     ...and you're a sadistic bastard...

               MUMFORD
     Yes.

               SOFIE
     ...who thinks there's nothing really 
     wrong with me.

               MUMFORD
     Oh, there's something wrong with 
     you, all right. Especially after 
     hearing that dream of yours, about 
     the Roto-Rooter.

She laughs. They're playing with each other.

               SOFIE
     That was really bad, wasn't it?

               MUMFORD
     Disgusting.

               SOFIE
     And I'll bet you can interpret the 
     whole thing

               MUMFORD
     It's pretty obvious to a trained 
     professional.

Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from 
his sack. He points to the next house.

               SOFIE
     I hate those dreams where everything 
     means something.

Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to 
him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, 
she glances away, uncomfortable.

               MUMFORD
     Is that when you split up?

               SOFIE
     No, that'd be a good story, but that 
     was just the beginning of the end. 
     We went on for another year or so.

Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house.

               SOFIE
     So whose route is this?

               MUMFORD
     Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. 
     Lives next door.

               SOFIE
     And he's where?

               MUMFORD
     In the capitol for Boy's Nation. 
     Five days. Why?

               SOFIE
          (heaves another paper)
     I'm thinking a gal could make a good 
     living doing this. How hard could it 
     be squeezing out some fourteen year 
     old?

               MUMFORD
     You like it?

               SOFIE
     It's all right.

               MUMFORD
     Then you can expect me at 5:30 
     tomorrow morning.

               SOFIE
     And this is legitimate therapy?

               MUMFORD
     Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want 
     to do it alone.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine 
pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED 
SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE 
to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- 
from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity 
Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or 
fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- 
jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff 
or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. The PAGE TURNING 
starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. 
Finally --

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     What is it, Nessa?

The IMAGES CONTINUE.

               NESSA (V.O.)
     Isn't she amazing? That is such a 
     wicked look.

               MUMFORD (V.O.)
     What do you want me to see?

               NESSA (V.O.)
     Just chill for a second. Look at 
     this guy, it appears he's actually 
     dead... but gorgeous.

Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch. At their feet 
is a mess of magazines. Nessa discards one and immediately 
starts flipping through a new one beneath it. She is very 
agitated. Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair.

               NESSA
     What are you doing? We're not done. 
     I just need to find the thing...

               MUMFORD
     If you don't want to have a session 
     today, it's okay.

               NESSA
     I want to have the session. I thought 
     it would be cool if I could show you 
     some of the things that interest me. 
     But I guess you're not into it... 
     which we already knew.

               MUMFORD
     What happened today?

               NESSA
     What are you talking about?

               MUMFORD
     Was it something that happened at 
     school?

               NESSA
          (petulant)
     These appointments were not my idea, 
     remember.

               MUMFORD
     True. Should we stop them?

A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides 
it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't 
use. Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed 
magazine on her chest.

               NESSA
     I don't think you know what you're 
     talking about.

               MUMFORD
     Uh-huh.

               NESSA
     This shrink school you went to... 
     did you hear about it on an 
     infomercial?

Mumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.

               NESSA
     I want to live in the world these 
     people are in. No one ever says 
     anything in there, have you noticed? 
     So they're very cool. Like they're 
     all really deep. It's when people 
     start talking that everything goes 
     to shit.

Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.

               NESSA
     There's this kid at school... Martin 
     Brockett. He has some gigantic idea 
     of himself that no one else shares. 
     You wouldn't believe the crap he 
     lays on me... Who appointed him my 
     spiritual leader? If he has everything 
     so figured out how come his best 
     friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he 
     spend all his time chasing after me? 
     Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a 
     hummer...

               MUMFORD
     Do you think that's what he wants?

               NESSA
          (after a beat)
     No. I don't know what he wants. But 
     I know I don't like being watched. 
     Nobody's ever paid any attention to 
     what I did, and I liked it just fine. 
     Where does he get off telling me I 
     disrespect myself?
          (a beat)
     Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.

EXT. LILY'S CAFÉ, MAIN STREET - DAY

Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with 
"APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, 
a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file 
neatly into Lily's Café. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside 
greeting them merrily.

               MUMFORD
     What's the deal?

Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered 
sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you 
tomorrow."

               LILY
     They come through a few times each 
     year.
          (greeting one cheerily)
     Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you 
     again!
          (back to Mumford)
     It's a tour.

               MUMFORD
     Where am I supposed to eat?

               LILY
     You're on your own today, honey.

Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across 
the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, 
then back out there.

WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on 
his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed 
Mumford.

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     Hey, Skip!

Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, 
barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily 
skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-
flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. 
Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.

               SKIP
     Doc.

Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately 
distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited 
to meet the local celebrity.

               MUMFORD
     Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, 
     Lily.

               LILY
     It's a pleasure to meet you.

               SKIP
          (flustered)
     Yeah... me you, too... I was at your 
     house...

               LILY
     Oh?

               SKIP
     Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's 
     very nice... I heard your shower.

Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other 
two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but 
he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has 
charmed her. Something's happening here.

               LILY
     I've seen you going by on your board, 
     but I didn't realize -- you're so 
     young... to be so...

               SKIP
     What?

               MUMFORD
     ...so rich?

               LILY
          (gives him a look)
     ...so accomplished.

               SKIP
     I may be young, but Doc can tell 
     you, I'm very immature.

He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're 
all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches 
the last of the tour enter the restaurant.

               SKIP
     So, is this like a Japanese 
     restaurant?

               LILY
     I'd better get in there.

               SKIP
     That's a lot of people all at once.

               LILY
     It's okay. They pre-order. There's a 
     choice of three entrees.

               SKIP
     What are they?

Lily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested? 
There's something about him...

               LILY
     Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or 
     salad nicoise.

               SKIP
     Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.

               LILY
          (giggling)
     You do?

               SKIP
     Yeah.

               LILY
     Well, come on in.

She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a 
"what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the 
sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.

               DELBANCO (O.S.)
     Dr. Mumford.

Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the 
shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes 
a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking 
hands --

               MUMFORD
     Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you 
     again.

               DELBANCO
     I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. 
     She's the other therapist here in 
     town.

               MUMFORD
          (shaking her hand)
     Of course... I've heard great things 
     about you.

               SHEELER
     Thank you.

               DELBANCO
     You never got back to me.
          (Mumford doesn't 
               understand)
     ...I called to say we'd like to take 
     you out for a meal?... Kind of a 
     professional welcome.

Mumford makes a show of remembering.

               MUMFORD
     Forgive me, please. What a gracious 
     thought. We must do that.

               SHEELER
     When?

               MUMFORD
     Why don't I call you when I've got 
     my calendar in front of me?

               DELBANCO
     What are you doing for lunch?

               MUMFORD
     Right now?

The other two nod in unison. Mumford considers, trapped.

INT. THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY

The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler 
are in a red leather booth. Sheeler listens with rapt, 
admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --

               DELBANCO
     ...annihilation anxieties engendered 
     by bad experiences with a depriving 
     mother... but no one can escape the 
     fear of death. It is, as Henry James 
     put it, "the worm at the core." Try 
     as we may to forget or ignore our 
     mortality, James said --
          (theatrically)
     -- "the skull will grin in at the 
     banquet."

Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary 
listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's 
adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --

               DELBANCO
     I've run on. Forgive me. We're here 
     to talk about you.

               MUMFORD
     Are we?

               SHEELER
          (covering)
     What Ernest means, I think, is we're 
     very interested in other 
     methodology... different kinds of 
     training. We're great believers in 
     learning from each other. I've learned 
     so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...

               DELBANCO
     ...And I from Phyllis.

               SHEELER
          (back to a previous 
               thread)
     So... the University of Kentucky. 
     Who runs the program down there?

               MUMFORD
     My mentor was an amazing teacher 
     named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite 
     tragically in the collapse of a 
     gazebo.

               DELBANCO
     I think I've heard of him... a 
     disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?

Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.

               MUMFORD
     It's possible. I don't know about 
     that.

               SHEELER
     I suppose your extended training was 
     at an institution in that area?

               MUMFORD
     Lots of institutions. My graduate 
     advisor believed we should experience 
     as many environments as possible -- 
     prisons, clinics, half-way houses. 
     For a while I was chief therapist in 
     a shopping mall. Had a little spot 
     next to the yogurt place.

               DELBANCO
     Interesting approach. What was his 
     name?

               MUMFORD
     Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She 
     passed last year in a train wreck. 
     Damned Amtrak.

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look. Sheeler adopts a 
"casual" tone --

               SHEELER
     I trained in the east, myself -- 
     Cornell -- and I don't care what 
     anyone says, there really are regional 
     differences. I found the state 
     certification exams out here quite 
     harrowing... Did you?

               MUMFORD
     Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess 
     that's good... to keep out the quacks.

               SHEELER
     Which examiner did you have? I 
     probably know him.

               MUMFORD
     Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.

A dark look comes over Sheeler's face for a moment.

               SHEELER
     That was a terrible thing.

               MUMFORD
          (agrees)
     I don't even know why hang-gliding 
     is considered a legitimate sport.

               DELBANCO
          (back on track)
     We're interested in any new therapies. 
     How would you characterize your 
     approach?

               MUMFORD
     My approach?

               SHEELER
     Yes... your particular approach.

               MUMFORD
     I don't have one really. Most of the 
     time I'm faking it. See, I think 
     there's not much that can be done 
     about most problems... they're too 
     complicated, too deep-rooted by the 
     time I hear about them. The most I 
     can do, usually, is look and listen 
     real closely, try to catch some 
     glimpse of the secret life everybody's 
     got. If I can get a sense of that, 
     well then, maybe... just maybe, I 
     can help them out a little.

Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. 
His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become 
uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally --

               DELBANCO
     I see.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON Althea Brockett.

               ALTHEA
     -- The argument had nothing to do 
     with it.

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     I understand. I just want to know 
     what the argument was about.

               ALTHEA
          (hates to say)
     I had ordered some books. "The 100 
     Greatest Books Ever Written."

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     Uh-huh. What are they?

               ALTHEA
     Oh, all the great writers -- 
     Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby 
     Dick... those people. Each is bound 
     in genuine premium leather with 22 
     carat gold accents. It's a magnificent 
     set -- and only $33.50 per volume. 
     Right away you get Great Expectations 
     for just $6.99.

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     One hundred books?

               ALTHEA
     It's irrelevant. It had nothing to 
     do with what happened.

               MUMFORD (O.S.)
     What happened?

Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a 
bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the 
only sign that she's not completely calm.

               ALTHEA
     We argued on Sunday. He went to work 
     on Monday and stayed in the city 
     during the week, like always. But on 
     Thursday, when he normally comes 
     home, he didn't. Didn't call either. 
     Not till Saturday afternoon.

               MUMFORD
     You must have been concerned.

               ALTHEA
     It's happened before.
          (a beat)
     I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. 
     I can't understand it.
          (a real question --)
     I'll probably have a complete 
     depressoid collapse soon, won't I?

               MUMFORD
     Doubtful. What did he say?

               ALTHEA
     He said he wasn't coming back. He 
     said it wasn't working for him any 
     more. That it hadn't "worked for 
     him" for quite a while... You know 
     what I regret the most? I'm sorry I 
     let him make the kids take his name. 
     He was an acquirer.
          (off Mumford's look)
     He liked to acquire things.

Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking.

               ALTHEA
     You think that has something to do 
     with my problem? Ordering all those 
     things?...

It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting 
thought.

               ALTHEA
     ...Like I was on some kind of campaign 
     to out-acquire him...
          (excited now, playing 
               it out)
     ...If I was just an acquisition to 
     him, and he lost interest once he 
     had me --

She stops, shakes her head.

               ALTHEA
     That can't be it. It's too simple. 
     And besides, I still like it. This 
     morning I ordered a marble turtle 
     cheese board from The Horchow 
     Collection.
          (an odd look)
     Can I tell you something just awful? 
     You know how people who are just 
     assholes will sometimes look at a 
     woman who's got problems and say, 
     "What she needs is a good shtupping!"?

Mumford nods.

               ALTHEA
     Well, there may be something to that. 
     Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, 
     what difference does it make?
          (suddenly)
     Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial? 
     You know what it feels like?...

She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast --

               ALTHEA
     I know my time's up, but I've got to 
     get this out while I've got hold of 
     it --

               MUMFORD
     Take your time.

               ALTHEA
          (no slowing down)
     -- When I was in high school, the 
     thing I wanted most, when I was stuck 
     in class, the thing I was always 
     desperately in pursuit of -- was a 
     hall pass. That's all I wanted. I 
     loved moving freely around the school 
     while everybody else was trapped in 
     there... And that's how I feel right 
     now... Like I have some giant, all-
     day hall pass.

She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She 
stands up abruptly, flushed.

               ALTHEA
     My god, did it just get hot in here 
     or what?

She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her 
purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up 
the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what 
all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, 
voluptuous figure.

               ALTHEA
     See you next time. I'll probably be 
     a basket case by then.

She heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford 
indicates the back door.

               MUMFORD
     You can go out there if you like...

               ALTHEA
          (quoting Mumford)
     "There's no shame in getting a little 
     therapy", right, Doc?

She opens the door to the waiting room, startling Henry 
Follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still 
in hand.

INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here. But that's 
secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy 
body framed in the doorway -- is having on him. She's been a 
customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the 
first time. All his libidinous buttons are being pushed. 
Althea breezes by, oblivious to his reaction.

               ALTHEA
     Hello, Mr. Follett. Have a good 
     session. Bye, Doc.

She goes out.

               MUMFORD
     Henry...

But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has 
gone.

INT. LOBBY ATRIUM, PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a 
PANDA SECURITY AIDE. Her informal uniform, and all the other 
details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif. 
As they head down the main corridor --

               SKIP (O.S.)
     Hey, Doc!

Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending 
from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of 
ramps designed for that purpose alone. None of the hustling 
Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of 
the sight.

Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp 
with a spectacular stop.

               SKIP
     Thanks, Jennifer, I'll take him from 
     here.

The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside) 
leads Mumford into a side corridor.

INT. BOWELS OF THE BUILDING, PANDA MODEM HEADQUARTERS - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS. Skip and Mumford move through a maze of 
hallways with progressively less foot traffic.

               SKIP
     I've never brought anyone down here 
     before.

               MUMFORD
     I'm honored.

               SKIP
     Doc, there's something about what 
     you told me the other night I can't 
     get out of my head. It's driving me 
     batty --
          (Mumford nods, waits)
     Why me? How did you know you could 
     trust me?

               MUMFORD
     You're completely reliable.

Skip is pleased. They approach a heavy steel door, the 
entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits 
at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area. 
Skip shouts down there --

               SKIP
     It's just me, Dino!

The old man nods, barely awake.

               MUMFORD
     Skip, I've got a problem and I need 
     some advice.

               SKIP
     You want my advice? Far out!

Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some 
lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. 
Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He 
hesitates, suddenly concerned --

               SKIP
     I hope nothing you're about to see 
     will shake your faith in me.

Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open 
far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind 
them.

INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY

Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What 
at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. 
Many different disciplines interface here:

THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some 
incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, 
sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect 
them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends 
from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a 
huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.

THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens, 
some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated 
motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer 
generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.

THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, 
limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber 
vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.

THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make 
rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer 
designed.

All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high-
tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, 
picking up the odd item.

               SKIP
     Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally 
     disgusted?

               MUMFORD
          ("no")
     Skip, you're a visionary. That can 
     be a burden.

               SKIP
     This doesn't seem a little... 
     perverse?

               MUMFORD
     There are a lot of lonely people in 
     the world. Somebody's gonna figure 
     this out someday.

               SKIP
     It's not going to be me. I'm giving 
     it up.

               MUMFORD
     Really?

               SKIP
     It's all your fault. In the last 48 
     hours, I've completely lost interest.

               MUMFORD
     What'd I do?

Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face.

               SKIP
     Lily.

               MUMFORD
     Lily...
          (gets it)
     ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

               SKIP
     Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. 
     Right now, of the two of us, I'm the 
     only one in love. But I'm very stoked.

Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by 
an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic 
section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.

               SKIP
     Doc, how I can be of help to you?

Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a 
button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and 
sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes 
a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.

               SKIP
     Sorry...

               MUMFORD
     Wow.

Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford.

               SKIP
     I'm here for you, Doc.

               MUMFORD
     Skip, you know that it's improper -- 
     completely unethical -- for a licensed 
     psychologist to carry on a romantic 
     relationship with one of his patients?

               SKIP
     I guess that makes sense.

               MUMFORD
     Yes, yes it does...

Mumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room.

               SKIP
     You've fallen in love with one of 
     your patients?

Mumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful. 
Suddenly, he has an alarming thought.

               SKIP
     Doc!... It's not me, is it?

               MUMFORD
     What?

Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh.

               MUMFORD
     No, Skip, it's not you. But I like 
     you a lot.

Skip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens.

               SKIP
     Doc, what about this? You're not 
     really a licensed psychologist!

Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the 
ramifications of what he's just said.

               SKIP
     Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I 
     see where you're going here. It's a 
     mess.

               MUMFORD
     Yep.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco 
is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa.

               LIONEL
     Don't you find it incredibly 
     convenient that everyone who could 
     possibly corroborate his story has 
     recently died some exotic death?

               DELBANCO
     They're neither all recent nor exotic.

               SHEELER
     But they're certainly dead. And yes, 
     personally, I find it a bit odd.

               DELBANCO
     It could happen. What about his state 
     certification exams? The records 
     seem to be in order.

Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

               LIONEL
     What's easier than hacking your way 
     into a state computer and inserting 
     some numbers? For all you know he 
     never even took the exams!

               SHEELER
     That's true.

               DELBANCO
     I don't know that it's all that 
     easy...

               LIONEL
     Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but 
     it sounds to me like you've gone for 
     this guy's story hook, line and bull-
     twaddle.

               SHEELER
     You do seem much more disposed toward 
     him than I understand, Ernest. Did I 
     miss something?

               DELBANCO
          (sharply)
     Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we 
     have no reason to doubt the man! Are 
     we listening to Lionel now?

Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so 
humiliated for Lionel to witness it. Fighting tears and trying 
to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks 
to the door. Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.

               DELBANCO
     Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 
     shout...

               SHEELER
     No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am 
     sorry. Sorry to have wasted your 
     time with such...

She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco 
is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the 
doctor least wants to see.

INT. LILY'S CAFÉ - DAY

Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily 
busily working the midday rush. She sees him grinning at 
her, but doesn't say anything for a while. Finally, blushing --

               LILY
     Stop it! He's a kid. I'm old enough 
     to be his... older sister.

Mumford smiles, eats.

INT. ENTRY HALL, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Mr. Cook opens the front door to Mumford.

               COOK
     Dr. Mumford. Please, come in.

Mumford comes in, reluctantly.

               MUMFORD
     Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if 
     Sofie was around?

               COOK
     Were you supposed to have a session?

               MUMFORD
     No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

INT. LIVING ROOM, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's 
thirtyish brother, BEN, are in there, watching television. 
Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand, 
muting the TV with a remote.

               COOK
     Look who's here. Have you met Sofie's 
     moth--

               MRS. COOK
     -- We've met.

               COOK
     And our son, Ben...

               BEN
          (vigorously shakes 
               hands)
     This is a real honor, Doctor. Have a 
     seat, will ya?

Mumford continues to stand.

               MUMFORD
     Well, actually, I can't really... Do 
     you think I could see Sofie?

               BEN
     I insist! I've been wanting to meet 
     you.

Mumford sits.

               MRS. COOK
          (icy)
     Sofie's not here.

Mumford's surprised. Mr. Cook speaks with some pleasure.

               COOK
     Her friend from the city came and 
     took her out to dinner. First time 
     in a long time she's been willing.

               MUMFORD
     A friend?

               BEN
     We owe that to you. She's perked up 
     a lot since you started treating 
     her.

Mrs. Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting.

               MRS. COOK
     What'd you want?

               MUMFORD
     There's something I think we need to 
     talk about.

               MRS. COOK
     What?

               MR. COOK
     Elizabeth...

               MRS. COOK
     I think we have a right.

               BEN
     We certainly do not.

               MRS. COOK
     Keep it zipped, Ben.

Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue.

               MR. COOK
     Is there something we need to know, 
     Dr. Mumford?

Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them.

               MUMFORD
     Well... yes, I guess I should tell 
     you. I don't think I'm going to be 
     able to treat Sofie anymore.

Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook 
actually cheers up.

               MRS. COOK
     Finally, some common sense...

               MUMFORD
     What do you mean?

               MRS. COOK
     I think you know what I mean.

               MUMFORD
     No, I really don't.

               MRS. COOK
     I think you do.

               MUMFORD
     Why don't you tell me?

               MRS. COOK
          (very calm)
     Why don't you go to hell? It's all a 
     bunch of nonsense and you know it.

               MR. COOK
     Elizabeth, I'm tellin' you, stop 
     this...

               MRS. COOK
          (dismissive)
     You're telling me? That's rich...

               MUMFORD
          (standing up)
     I'd better go.

               BEN
     Why can't you see Sofie? I know the 
     treatment's working.

Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement.

               MUMFORD
     Well... you see, the problem is --

               MRS. COOK
     -- the problem is you're a big fake. 
     You haven't got a clue what's wrong 
     with that girl.

Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.

               MUMFORD
     Wow. You're something.

               MRS. COOK
     Take a hike, Dr. Quack!

               MR. COOK
          (ignoring her now)
     What is the problem, Doctor?

Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks 
to Mr. Cook.

               MUMFORD
     Problem? I guess there is no 
     problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, 
     where'd he take her?

               BEN
     It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with 
     her. I think they went over to The 
     Lantern.

               MUMFORD
          (delighted)
     Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy.

Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other 
two have not.

EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY

Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and 
into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two 
adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.

MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking 
intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa 
and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. 
Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the 
view is interrupted by a wall.

Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.

EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY

There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to 
the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. 
When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on 
the metal screen.

INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett's private space is above and at the back of his 
drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as 
Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the 
store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.

The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.

               FOLLETT
     What is it?

               MUMFORD
     It's a thought I had.

               FOLLETT
     Should I open it now?

Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto 
knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go 
on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.

               MUMFORD
     Let me just say something here... I 
     have no idea if this is going to 
     help.

               FOLLETT
     What exactly is it supposed to do?

               MUMFORD
     You remember when I asked you about 
     pornography --

               FOLLETT
     -- I find it degrading. Maximum 
     gynecology and minimum turn-on --

               MUMFORD
     -- and you told me that. Still, 
     there's some kind of imagery that's 
     haunting you and, I think, getting 
     in your way --

               FOLLETT
     -- Which I don't necessarily agree.

               MUMFORD
     But you did come to me.

Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.

               MUMFORD
     My guess is these images were burned 
     into your brain when you were young. 
     Maybe if we could nail down the exact 
     fantasies that are haunting you -- 
     maybe you could get past them... 
     Anyway, I thought we could try an 
     experiment.

               FOLLETT
          (indicating the box)
     And the experiment is in here?

Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.

               MUMFORD
     You know what? I think this was a 
     dumb idea...

He starts to take hold of the box.

               MUMFORD
     ...I just heard myself talking and I 
     realize I'm completely unqualified 
     to be doing this. Let's forget the 
     whole thing.

Follett grabs the box back.

               FOLLETT
     Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I 
     want to know what's in here.

               MUMFORD
          (pulling on the box)
     There's absolutely no reason to think 
     this is going to have any impact on 
     you. I'm embarrassed to have --

Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. 
Loud --

               FOLLETT
     Hey! I agree with you that you don't 
     know what you're talking about. That's 
     what I've been saying all along. And 
     I can guarantee you that looking at 
     the Lost Ark or whatever you got in 
     here is not going to mean diddly to 
     me...
          (quieting down)
     ...but if you think I'm going to let 
     you walk out of here without seeing 
     what's in this box, you don't know 
     much about Henry A. Follett.

Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe 
to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with 
much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett 
carefully cuts open the package.

THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the 
flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which 
has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- 
Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts away 
the wrapping --

There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties 
and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, 
Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag 
Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative 
illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors 
Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video 
tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW 
CABIN.

We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands 
shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very 
soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: 
voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out 
of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous 
businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, 
and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the 
erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.

SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized, 
galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a 
tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes 
from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing 
that could wreck his mood now, is --

               YOUNG PHARMACIST (O.S.)
     Mr. Follett --

Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young 
Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams 
everything back into the box as best he can and tries to 
cover it.

               FOLLETT
     What?! What the hell is so important 
     I can't have five minutes --?

The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the 
room.

               YOUNG PHARMACIST
     It's her, sir. You told me to get 
     you when she came to pick up her 
     prescription.

It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, 
his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist 
with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to 
Mumford.

               FOLLETT
     Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...
          (indicates box)
     ...I really appreciate what you're 
     trying to... uh, I can't thank you 
     enough for...

               MUMFORD
     My pleasure.

Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to 
check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.

               FOLLETT
     I'll see you on... whatever...

He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks 
down through the one-way mirror.

WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription 
counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she 
looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and 
begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett 
motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He 
comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea 
something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back 
against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in 
Follett's first fantasy.

Mumford reacts, bemused.

EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite 
her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous 
progress since we first saw her.

               SOFIE
     When I was in high school we used to 
     come up here and make out. I liked 
     to sit on the rock and watch the sun 
     go down.

               MUMFORD
     That's what I like.

               SOFIE
     Which thing?

               MUMFORD
     Either one.

               SOFIE
     Why'd you come to the house the other 
     night?

               MUMFORD
     I thought I had something to tell 
     you. But it turned out I didn't.

               SOFIE
     My brother said you were about to 
     fire me.

               MUMFORD
     That's one way to put it.

               SOFIE
     I bet I know what changed your mind...
          (Mumford looks at her)
     ...My mother. She was so horrible, 
     you decided you couldn't desert me.

               MUMFORD
     I thought only action movies had 
     villains like that.

Sofie gestures ahead.

               SOFIE
     That's the cut-off, isn't it?
          (Mumford nods)
     I know why you were going to quit 
     seeing me.

Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the 
woods.

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she 
steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of 
her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle 
herself.

               SOFIE
     You feel like a fake, an imposter...

Mumford looks up, sharply.

               SOFIE
     ...as if maybe you don't know what 
     you're doing.

She puts a hand on his arm.

               SOFIE
     Everybody feels that way sometimes... 
     like we're not who we're supposed to 
     be. But I have to tell you, Dr. 
     Mumford --

He winces at her formality.

               SOFIE
     -- you've been a tremendous help to 
     me.

               MUMFORD
     Yeah?

               SOFIE
     I can't tell you how much I admire 
     you. You have a wonderful way with 
     people. And you're very insightful. 
     I feel like you've seen me clearly... 
     I never used to admit what a horrible 
     person my mother was. You've made 
     that possible for me.

               MUMFORD
     That's... good?

               SOFIE
     Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never 
     accepted me for who I was, just like 
     Mother. The things you've said have 
     helped me understand what a dick he 
     is.

               MUMFORD
     I don't know if --

               SOFIE
     You're shockingly honest, that's 
     what makes you great. I've never had 
     a man treat me this way. With you, I 
     feel really... listened to.
          (gives him a look)
     Can I tell you something? It's a 
     little embarrassing, but I feel very 
     unguarded with you.

               MUMFORD
     Of course.

               SOFIE
     Thanks to this therapy, I now know 
     what I'm looking for. I need to find 
     a man like you.
          (laughs)
     Not one who's treating me, of course.
          (full of resolve)
     And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've 
     given me the confidence.

Mumford is in agony.

               MUMFORD
     Sofie... that makes me very happy.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette. 
There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her.

               NESSA
     ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously 
     deluded. I said that to him, I said, 
     "If you think I'm gonna do all that 
     shit for you, man, you are seriously 
     deluded."

               MUMFORD
     What'd he say?

               NESSA
          (can't hide her 
               pleasure)
     He said -- "Which we already knew!"

Mumford laughs, delighted.

               MUMFORD
     What did he want you to do?

               NESSA
     First off, he tells me to stop smoking 
     cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'-
     lutely no. As you can see --

She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle 
finger, flipping the bird.

               NESSA
     Then he says stop smoking dope. No 
     again. So then he says he doesn't 
     want me getting together with any 
     other guys...

Mumford doesn't have to see her face to know how much pleasure 
this gives her, despite her hard-ass cover.

               NESSA
     ...What balls on this guy? What're 
     we...
          (too geeky for her)
     ...going steady? Jesus.

               MUMFORD
     No again?

               NESSA
          (long pause)
     I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns 
     me. And the last thing was insane. I 
     don't know what's wrong with him... 
     No magazines.

               MUMFORD
     Really?

               NESSA
     I don't know if I can quit. We're 
     gonna try it together, like, you 
     know, AA or something. And I made 
     him give up his .22. No more sneaking 
     around the hills with his fucking 
     nut gun like some loony tune.

               MUMFORD
     He agreed?

               NESSA
          (yes)
     He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I 
     don't know how much longer I can put 
     up with it. I already got two arms 
     and legs, I don't need another 
     appendage.

She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her 
cigarette as she stands up --

               NESSA
     Oops... gotta go!

She heads toward the waiting room. Mumford gestures to 
indicate the back door. She waves him off. He shakes his 
head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.

Nessa opens the door to the waiting room. Martin Brockett is 
sitting there. He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the 
fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying 
around, then stands up. She goes into his arms like maybe 
she's the puppy. He beams and looks at Mumford.

               MARTIN
     Hiya, Doc.

               MUMFORD
     Martin.

               MARTIN
          (pulling Nessa tighter)
     Did you straighten her out?

Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows 
smoke in his face.

               MUMFORD
     How are you?

               MARTIN
     Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family 
     got five hundred times better.
          (turning Nessa)
     Let's go, Vanessa.

Nessa gives Mumford an embarrassed, "ain't he corny?" look, 
but as they go out the door, she's never looked happier.

               GILROY (O.S.)
     Doctor Mumford?

Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, GILROY, rising 
from the chair behind the door. He's got a briefcase and a 
document in his hand.

               MUMFORD
     I didn't see you there. Can I help 
     you?

               GILROY
     My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State 
     Certification Board.

He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't 
take it.

               GILROY
     It's all right, it won't bite you. 
     Under civil code 1294.67b you are 
     entitled to be notified that your 
     status and certification are being 
     reviewed. This is the notice.

               MUMFORD
          (takes the paper)
     Do you want to come in?

               GILROY
          (already leaving)
     No thanks. Plenty of time for that 
     when we're a little further along.

               MUMFORD
     Mr. Gilroy --

Gilroy stops, outside door already open.

               MUMFORD
     What brought this on?

               GILROY
     I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes 
     it's just routine, sometimes there's 
     been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

He goes out. Mumford considers the paper in his hands, 
thoughts elsewhere.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A PACKING CARTON half full of books. PULLING BACK 
and FLOATING OVER other boxes, half-packed with Mumford's 
personal belongings -- he doesn't have a lot. On the bed, an 
open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in. We're STILL MOVING 
across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in 
his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.

Mumford HEARS THE SHOWER GO ON downstairs at Lily's. Then 
the MURMUR AND GIGGLE of a wet couple.

               SKIP (O.S.)
     Far out!

Mumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door 
behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to 
the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them 
back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he 
is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying 
on Mumford's couch -- a patient.

               DELBANCO
     ...and when you said at lunch about 
     everybody having "a secret life", 
     something just snapped inside me. I 
     knew I could no longer continue my 
     relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It 
     was tearing me up inside. And I know 
     Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed 
     from it. What had started as a genuine 
     respect, I think, for each other's 
     professional abilities, and became, 
     over time, a personal attraction had 
     somehow... migrated into a rather 
     torrid sexual relationship...

Across the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no 
reaction.

               DELBANCO
     ...I won't go into that today. Though, 
     if we should continue these sessions, 
     as I certainly hope we will, there 
     are some aspects of that I would 
     like to look at. God knows, I've 
     listened to enough people giving me 
     the juicy --
          (catches himself)
     ...At any rate, I just wanted to 
     acknowledge the catalyzing effect 
     your comment had on me. I just hope 
     that it doesn't come roiling back 
     upon you like some dreadful undertow.

               MUMFORD
     How do you mean?

This next is painful for Delbanco.

               DELBANCO
     Well... you see, when I broke it off 
     with Phyllis, she was naturally upset 
     and she became more determined than 
     ever to pursue certain -- how to put 
     it -- doubts she's been harboring...

               MUMFORD
     What kind of doubts?

               DELBANCO
     About you... your background and 
     your qualifications. I'm afraid 
     Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in 
     her fury with me, and actually took 
     the whole issue to the state board.

Mumford digests this.

               MUMFORD
     I see.

               DELBANCO
     And please, for whatever small way I 
     may have encouraged this, accept my 
     apologies.
          (brightens)
     There is good news, though.

               MUMFORD
     What's that?

               DELBANCO
     Phyllis has decided to leave town 
     and pursue her practice in the city. 
     Which leaves you the only psychologist 
     in town.

               MUMFORD
     Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm 
     sorry to hear that.

               DELBANCO
     As you can imagine, my own feelings 
     about this are mixed... Unlike, I 
     must say, those of my wife.

Mumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married.

EXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - 
DAY

We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS 
behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's 
fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man 
Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the 
backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     Old Man Sutter's young bride had got 
     me in hot water all right, and now I 
     was bein' dealt the beating of my 
     life. If there'd just been two of 
     those bastards it would have been a 
     little closer...

One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. 
CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:

INT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage 
foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen 
Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half-
open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing 
on her thumb.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     The Landlady was good at quite a few 
     things, but doctoring wasn't one of 
     them...

CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually 
played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for 
the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the 
manner of a fifties movie.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     ...Lucky for me, one of the other 
     boarders, the broad who lived 
     downstairs in the front room...

BACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and 
steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now 
in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     ...was a nurse...

As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, 
Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages 
and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern 
on her face.

               FOLLETT (V.O.)
     ...and she had ways to make you feel 
     better they didn't teach in nursing 
     school.

Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, 
BLACKING OUT THE SCENE.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's 
glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the 
end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets 
up.

               MUMFORD
     I'm very happy for you, Henry.

Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it 
vigorously.

               MUMFORD
     I feel like we're making real progress 
     here.

               FOLLETT
     Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you 
     what that package meant to me --

Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Follett 
accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone 
still wants to use that door.

Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers 
when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not 
expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office 
door and opens it.

Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. 
She peers past him to see if he's alone.

               SOFIE
     I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can 
     I come in?

               MUMFORD
     Of course.

Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing 
her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.

               SOFIE
     We haven't met in this office since 
     that first time. This is how a real 
     professional and his client are 
     supposed to see each other.

Mumford waits.

               SOFIE
     It might've been more appropriate if 
     we had followed a traditional approach 
     to the doctor-patient relationship.

               MUMFORD
     Is something wrong, Sofie?

               SOFIE
     Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. 
     Mumford.

               MUMFORD
     You're upset.

               SOFIE
     How intuitive! That must take years 
     of training right there. Maybe you 
     can guess what has upset me.

Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing 
through his mind. Finally, carefully --

               MUMFORD
     Is it something you've heard about 
     me?

               SOFIE
     No, it is not something I've heard 
     about you! It is someth--
          (stops suddenly)
     Why? Is there something I should 
     have heard about you?

               MUMFORD
     Why don't you tell me what's on your 
     mind?

Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she 
looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the 
couch --

               SOFIE
     May I?

Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up and 
lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's 
face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) 
This seems to help Sofie a bit.

               SOFIE
     All right... I'm going to come right 
     out and say this, because that's 
     what your shrink is for, right, so 
     you can tell him what's bothering 
     you?

               MUMFORD
     Um-huh.

               SOFIE
          (tone still rough)
     First of all, I have been feeling 
     much better lately. I don't know if 
     the syndrome is over -- if it's just 
     run its course or something -- but I 
     feel a hundred per cent better than 
     when I first came to you.

               MUMFORD
     I'm glad.

               SOFIE
     Given that, I'm obviously not going 
     to be judging things in the most 
     realistic way.

               MUMFORD
     I don't follow you.

               SOFIE
          (sharply)
     I'm saying that since I'm doing so 
     much better -- which I attribute to 
     you -- I'm liable to misinterpret 
     some of my feelings.

               MUMFORD
          (tentative)
     Okay...

               SOFIE
     The point is this -- I am not a blank 
     page. I did not just fall off the 
     turnip truck. Do you know what I 
     mean?

               MUMFORD
     I think so.

               SOFIE
     I know a little about psychology. I 
     took three different courses in 
     college. It's true, none of them 
     were above the two hundred level, 
     but I took them... And there was one 
     concept I remember very well.

               MUMFORD
     What was that?

               SOFIE
     Transference!

               MUMFORD
     Transference.

               SOFIE
     Yes, and that is what I have got 
     right now. I have taken my feelings 
     of gratitude... and relief... and 
     transferred them onto... you. I have 
     taken all those warm, grateful 
     emotions and confused them with 
     feelings for you... So that now I am 
     under the delusion...
          (a deep breath)
     ...that I am in love with you.

Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence 
in the room. Sofie does not look back there.

               SOFIE
     Hello?

               MUMFORD
     Hello.

               SOFIE
     I think you can understand why I 
     have some serious questions about 
     your methods. I mean, obviously it 
     becomes much more likely that I'm 
     going to have confusion about this 
     when your idea of treatment is to go 
     walking in the woods and up to make-
     outs-ville and do all these highly 
     romantic activities --

Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but 
refuses to acknowledge it.

               SOFIE
     -- We had a paper route together, 
     for godssake! Do you understand how 
     I might be a little resentful? Knowing 
     that this so-called "love" I'm feeling 
     is totally bogus, and just a pathetic 
     case of... transference?

Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --

               MUMFORD
     Yes.

Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back 
of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, 
but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.

               SOFIE
     Maybe you ought to think about how 
     you're going to fix this. And when 
     you do...
          (suddenly losing her 
               will)
     ...please get back to me.

Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a 
step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into 
the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front 
yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.

               MUMFORD
     Hey, Ainge.

Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the 
garden.

               LILY
     Doc...

               MUMFORD
          (keeps walking)
     Lily.

               LILY
     Doc.

Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence.

               LILY
     I don't want you to be mad at Skip...

               MUMFORD
     He told you.

               LILY
          (yes)
     Skip and I wouldn't have got together 
     if it weren't for you. That's a big 
     deal.

               MUMFORD
          (dismisses it)
     You would have met in some shower 
     eventually...

               LILY
     I want to give you something. Will 
     you let me?

               MUMFORD
     Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

               LILY
     Yes, you do, you damn well do.

               MUMFORD
          (can't fight)
     Okay.

               LILY
     Here it is, some advice -- do the 
     hard thing.

               MUMFORD
     That's it? That's what you're giving 
     me?

               LILY
     Clean up the mess. No matter what it 
     takes.

Mumford leans down to pet Ainge.

               MUMFORD
     What it might take is... doing time.

               LILY
     Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. 
     I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says 
     you're in love.

Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.

               LILY
     Then it's worth it.

Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the 
fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over 
to her side.

               MUMFORD
     I'll tell her tonight.

Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange 
juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. 
Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter 
and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares 
inside.

UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a 
story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from 
Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near 
Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented 
delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied 
by appropriate footage:

               ROBERT STACK
     ...A drug rehabilitation center in 
     the lonely southwestern desert... 
     run by reclusive monks... becomes 
     the point of departure in a mysterious 
     vanishing...

A CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture 
of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. 
His name is not visible.

               ROBERT STACK
     ...as an intrepid government 
     investigator disappears -- without a 
     trace.

In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:

LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters, 
etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from 
Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like 
Mumford playing him.

IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly, 
it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently, 
lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. 
When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the 
hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa 
cushion.

ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's 
version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -- 
are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.

               ROBERT STACK
     ...despite brilliant promise as a 
     fearless investigator... found himself 
     on a downward spiral of drug abuse 
     and dissolution...

MUMFORD'S SISTER, the real thing, a plain, middle-aged West 
Virginia woman, appears in a "dramatic", badly-lit interview. 
(As with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered 
title.)

               MUMFORD'S SISTER
     ...we didn't talk much after our 
     folks died, but I know he felt his 
     life had taken a wrong turn...

A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for 
a flash. Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his 
neck encircled by Gregory's arm. Candy is on the other side 
of Gregory.

A shot of the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a State Police Cruiser 
zips by.

               ROBERT STACK
     His former undercover partner at the 
     IRS... is now a trooper with the 
     Pennsylvania State Police...

GREGORY, in State Police uniform, with a sadistic glint in 
his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by.

               GREGORY
     The guy was obsessed... didn't always 
     know where to draw the line... but I 
     would have trusted him with my wife -- 
     er, my life --
          (looks off camera, 
               laughing)
     -- What'd I say? Both, actually...
          (gets serious again)
     ...I can't say I was surprised, 
     though, when he disappeared.

Ragged telephoto shots of the Drug Rehab Center in the desert, 
low, innocuous adobe buildings.

               ROBERT STACK
     Who was this enigma... a courageous 
     public servant or a debauched 
     addict?... Either way, his last known 
     stop was here... isolated in the 
     Arizona desert... taken in by an 
     order of devoted monks...

IN AN ARIZONA TOWN, a monk with a clerical collar, BROTHER 
TIMOTHY, is loading groceries into the back of a pick-up. 
He's being ambush interviewed. He's polite, but not 
cooperative.

               BROTHER TIMOTHY
     We don't talk about the people who've 
     been our guests... but I can tell 
     you this about our order -- we believe 
     everybody has the right to start 
     over... everybody deserves a second 
     chance.

Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway.

               ROBERT STACK
     And perhaps... that is exactly the 
     chance the now-sober pilgrim took... 
     on a blustery November day... walking 
     away from the rehab center... never 
     to be heard from again...

MUMFORD'S SISTER AGAIN:

               MUMFORD'S SISTER
     I'd like to know if he's alive. If 
     he is, I just hope he's happy and 
     his new life is...
          (not sure how to put 
               it)
     ...well, I hope he's found what he 
     was looking for...

Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion.

His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, 
dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on 
the show comes up. A 1-800 telephone number appears across 
the bottom of the frame.

               ROBERT STACK
     If you have any information about 
     this man or know anything about his 
     whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's 
     Department in Cochise County, Arizona, 
     or call this number...

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of 
Mumford.

WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, 
one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV 
light.

EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In 
fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of 
breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the 
doorbell, and waits.

Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially 
sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.

               MRS. COOK
     Well, look who's here...

               MUMFORD
     Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

               MRS. COOK
     Just who is here, can you tell me?

               MUMFORD
     Could I see Sofie, please?

               MRS. COOK
     No, you can not. I wouldn't know who 
     to say is calling.

               SOFIE (O.S.)
     Mother...

Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then 
hisses at Mumford --

               MRS. COOK
     I could see right through you from 
     the start, you imposter. I know what 
     you're after. I knew it then and I 
     know it now!

Sofie appears behind her mother.

               SOFIE
     Mother...

               MUMFORD
     What do you think I'm after, Mrs. 
     Cook?

               MRS. COOK
     Sofie. It's so obvious... you're 
     after my daughter.

               MUMFORD
     Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're 
     right about that.

Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs. 
Cook recovers fastest --

               MRS. COOK
     It'll never happen! You're in big 
     trouble, mister.

               SOFIE
          (scary strong)
     Mother... go away!

Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and 
makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks 
at him through the screen.

               MUMFORD
     I guess you saw the show...?

               SOFIE
     Which show was that?

               MUMFORD
     Sofie...

               SOFIE
     Part of it. We were watching "ER" 
     until someone called.

               MUMFORD
     You probably got the idea.

Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at 
him as she walks to the other end of the porch.

               SOFIE
     Do you know what a betrayal this 
     is?...

Mumford knows.

               SOFIE
     ...How violated I feel?

               MUMFORD
     You're not the only one...

Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.

               SOFIE
     You feel violated?

               MUMFORD
     Not me... all my other my patients. 
     I smelled tar and feathers on the 
     way over here.

               SOFIE
     You deserve it.

Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.

               SOFIE
     I should be irate.

Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --

               SOFIE
     I am irate!

               MUMFORD
          (grabbing at the thread)
     But...

               SOFIE
     But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This 
     is a terrible thing you've done.

               MUMFORD
     I know it! Please believe me, I know 
     that...

Mumford steps closer to her.

               MUMFORD
     But, there is one... mitigating factor 
     I want you to consider before you 
     write me off.

               SOFIE
     What?

               MUMFORD
     Will you think about it?

               SOFIE
     I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad 
     mood.

               MUMFORD
     I love you. More than I've ever loved 
     anyone or anything in my life.

She looks into his eyes.

               SOFIE
     Oh.

               MUMFORD
     I want to spend the rest of my life 
     with you... but I'm not sure you 
     feel the same way.

She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.

               SOFIE
     I sort of do...

Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.

               SOFIE
     ...but first, you have to tell me 
     something...

               MUMFORD
     Anything... just ask.

               SOFIE
     What is your name?

As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Mumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie, 
Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail.

               JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
     The defendant will rise.

Mumford and Lionel stand up.

               JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
     Sit down, Lionel.

Lionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the 
first time, a tough guy in his sixties.

               JUDGE OTTO
     Clarence Norman White, do you 
     understand how serious are the crimes 
     with which you have been charged?

               MUMFORD
     I do.

               JUDGE OTTO
     Do you realize how insidious it is 
     to invade the most private thoughts 
     and secret lives of unsuspecting 
     people?...

WE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. 
Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting 
together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and 
MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, 
sits with the PROSECUTOR.

               JUDGE OTTO
     ...People who have come to you with 
     the faith that you know what you're 
     doing... and that you are who you 
     say you are?

               MUMFORD
     Yes, your honor.

               JUDGE OTTO
     It means absolutely nothing to me 
     that so many of your patients have 
     come forward with praise for you and 
     your therapeutic skills. You 
     understand that?

               MUMFORD
     Yes.

Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. 
But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the 
end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size 
too small.

She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs 
provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting 
is working really well for both of them.

               JUDGE OTTO
     Mr. White, I am frustrated that the 
     criminal code in this state allows a 
     maximum sentence of only six months 
     and a maximum fine of only $2000.

               MUMFORD
     I'm sorry, your honor.

               JUDGE OTTO
     What?

               MUMFORD
     I'm sorry you're frustrated.

               JUDGE OTTO
     Are you disrespecting this court, 
     Mr. White?

               MUMFORD
     No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

               JUDGE OTTO
     Maybe you can empathize with this -- 
     Maximum fine. Three months in jail, 
     three months house arrest. Sentence 
     to begin immediately at the Orchard 
     Valley Correctional Facility. Case 
     closed. This court is adjourned.

The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A 
DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up 
and leans in --

               LIONEL
     It's a country club. Don't worry 
     about it.

               MUMFORD
     Thanks for your help, Lionel.

Mumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his 
hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all 
with his usual self-satisfaction --

               LIONEL
     I'll have him out in half the time.

WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.

               SOFIE
     You got off easy.

               MUMFORD
     Will you wait for me?

               SOFIE
     We're only talking about six weeks.

               MUMFORD
     Will you be here?

               SOFIE
     Of course... I haven't got the energy 
     to get out of town that fast.

They kiss. The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we --

                                   CUT TO:

INT. STATE CORRECTIONAL SEDAN - DAY

Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal 
restraint. A lone COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER is up front, 
driving. There's a heavy security screen divider between 
front and back.

               CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
     Better make yourself comfortable. We 
     got a three hour drive here.

               MUMFORD
     I'm fine.

               CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
     You're the shrink, aren't you?

               MUMFORD
     No, not really.

               CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
     But you do therapy?

               MUMFORD
     Not any more.

They ride along in silence. At peace, Mumford watches the 
town go by. Finally --

               CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
     I'll tell you, Doc, the wife and I, 
     we got a little bit of a problem. 
     Would you mind if I just ran it by 
     you?

The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view 
mirror, waiting hopefully. Mumford ponders the question a 
long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug.

               MUMFORD
     Go ahead.

EXT. MAIN STREET, EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business 
district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford 
behind.

FADE OUT.

                         THE END
