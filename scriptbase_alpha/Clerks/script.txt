     INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS

     A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

     A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

     A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
     Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
     Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
     askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
     corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
     atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
     resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
     swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
     rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
     it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
     back to the camera, phone in hand.

                    FIGURE
               (groggily)
          Hello...What?...No, I don't work
          today...I'm playing hockey at two.

     THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

                    FIGURE (O.C.)
          Why don't you call Randal?...
          Because I'm fucking tired....I just
          closed last night....
               (deep sigh)
          Jesus...What time are you going to
          come in?...Twelve...Be there be
          twelve?...Swear...

     A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
     decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

                    FIGURE (O.C.)
          Swear you'll be in by twelve and
          I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
          walk.

     THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
     slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
     and stands.

     THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
     Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
     is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
     Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

                    DANTE
          Next time, I get the bed.

                                                  2.


     He releases the dog and sits up.

                    DANTE
               (exhausted)
          Shit.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER

     A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
     the toilet.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER

     A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
     grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER

     Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
     scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER

     DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
     for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
     THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER

     DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
     atop a VCR.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER

     A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

                              CUT TO:

                                                  3.


     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
     from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

                              CUT TO:

     DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
     it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
     store.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
     lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
     convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
     camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
     knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
     remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
     Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
     the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
     to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
     PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
     papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
     his eyes as it occurs to him.

                    DANTE
          Shit.

     The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE

     Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
     approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
     the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
     reaches toward the camera.

     DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
     vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
     as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
     the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
     him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

                              CUT TO:

                                                  4.


     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
     flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
     looks down at it.

                    DANTE
          Shit!

     The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
     obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
     DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
     trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
     folded white sheet.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
     his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
     the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
     sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I
     ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to
     OPEN.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

     The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
     morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
     drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
     morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

                              CUT TO:

                                                  5.


     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

                    DANTE
          Thanks. Have a good one.

                    ACTIVIST
          Do you mind if I drink this here?

                    DANTE
          Sure. Go ahead.

     The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
     Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

                    CUSTOMER
          Are you open?

                    DANTE
          Yeah.

                    CUSTOMER
          Pack of cigarettes.

                    ACTIVIST
          Are you sure?

                    CUSTOMER
          Am I sure?

                    ACTIVIST
          Are you sure?

                    CUSTOMER
          Am I sure about what?

                    ACTIVIST
          Do you really want to buy those
          cigarettes?

                    CUSTOMER
          Are you serious?

                    ACTIVIST
          How long have you been smoking?

                    CUSTOMER
               (to DANTE)
          What is this, a poll?

                    DANTE
          Beats me.

                                                  6.


                    ACTIVIST
          How long have you been a smoker?

                    CUSTOMER
          Since I was thirteen.

     The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
     it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

                    ACTIVIST
          I'd say you're about nineteen,
          twenty, am I right?

                    CUSTOMER
          What the hell is that?

                    ACTIVIST
          That's your lung. By this time,
          your lung looks like this.

                    CUSTOMER
          You're shittin' me.

                    ACTIVIST
          You think I'm shitting you...

     The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

                    CUSTOMER
          What's this?

                    ACTIVIST
          It's a trach ring. It's what they
          install in your throat when throat
          cancer takes your voice box. This
          one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

                    CUSTOMER
               (drops ring)
          Unnhh!

                    ACTIVIST
               (picks up the ring)
          He smoked until the day he died.
          Used to put the cigarette in this
          thing and smoke it that way.

                    DANTE
          Excuse me, but...

                                                  7.


                    ACTIVIST
          This is where you're heading. A
          cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
          in your throat. Do you really want
          that?

                    CUSTOMER
          Well, if it's already too late...

                    ACTIVIST
          It's never too late. Give those
          cigarettes back now, and buy some
          gum instead.
               (grabs nearby pack, reads)
          Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

                    CUSTOMER
          It's not the same.

                    ACTIVIST
          It's cheaper than cigarettes. And
          it certainly beats this.

     Hands him a picture.

                    CUSTOMER
          Jesus!

                    ACTIVIST
          It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
          lung. Keep it.

                    CUSTOMER
               (to DANTE)
          I'll just take the gum.

                    DANTE
          Fifty-five.

                    ACTIVIST
          You've made a wise choice. Keep up
          the good work.

     The CUSTOMER exits.

                    DANTE
          Maybe you should take that coffee
          outside.

                    ACTIVIST
          No, I think I'll drink it in here,
          thanks.

                                                  8.


                    DANTE
          If you're going to drink it in
          here, I'd appreciate it if you'd
          not bother the customers.

                    ACTIVIST
          Okay. I'm sorry about that.

     Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

                    CUSTOMER
          Pack of cigarettes.
               (looks at model)
          What's that?

                    ACTIVIST
          This? How long have you been smoking?

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
     BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
     SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
     dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

                    JAY
          WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!

     SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

                    JAY
          I feel good today, Silent Bob.
          We're gonna make some money! And
          then you know what we're going to
          do? We're going to go to that party
          and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck
          this bitch, that bitch...
               (Blue Velvet Hopper)
          I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!

     SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.

                    JAY
               (to O.C.)
          What you looking at?! I'll kick
          your fucking ass!
               (to SILENT BOB)
          Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
          me ten bucks?

     SILENT BOB nods.

                                                  9.


                    JAY
          Tonight, you and me are going off
          that fucker's head, and take out
          his fucking soul! Remind me if he
          tries to buy something from us, to
          cut it with leafs and twigs...or
          fucking shit in the motherfucker's
          bag!

     Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.

                    JAY
          Wa sup sluts?
               (to SILENT BOB)
          Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
          motherfucker! But you're cute as
          hell.
               (slowly drops to knees)
          I wanna go down on you, and suckle
          you.

          And then, I wanna line up three
          more guys, and make like a circus
          seal...

     JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
     looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
     humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

                    JAY
          Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I
          fucking hate guys!
               (yelling)
          I LOVE WOMEN!

          Neh.

     A GUY comes up to them.

                    GUY
          You selling?

     A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
     has become something of a rally.

                                             10.


                    ACTIVIST
          You're spending what? Twenty,
          thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.

                    LISTENER 1
          Forty.

                    LISTENER 2
          Fifty-three.

                    ACTIVIST
          Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
          someone that much money every week
          to kill you? Because that's what
          you're doing now, by paying for the
          so-called privilege to smoke!

                    LISTENER 3
          We all gotta go sometime...

                    ACTIVIST
          It's that kind of mentality that
          allows this cancer-producing
          industry to thrive. Of course we're
          all going to die someday, but do we
          have to pay for it? Do we have to
          actually throw hard-earned dollars
          on a counter and say, "Please,
          please, Mister Merchant of Death,
          sir; please sell me something that
          will give me bad breath, stink up
          my clothes, and fry my lungs."

                    LISTENER 1
          It's not that easy to quit.

                    ACTIVIST
          Of course it's not; not when you
          have people like this mindless
          cretin so happy and willing to sell
          you nails for your coffin!

                    DANTE
          Hey, now wait a sec...

                    ACTIVIST
          Now he's going to launch into his
          rap about how he's just doing his
          job; following orders.

                    ACTIVIST (CONT'D)
          Friends, let me tell you about
          another bunch of hate mongers that
          were just following orders: they
          were called Nazis, and they
          practically wiped a nation of
          people from the Earth...just like
          cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
          smoking is the new Holocaust, and
          those that partake in the practice
          of smoking or sell the wares that
          promote it are the Nazis of the
          nineties! He doesn't care how many
          people die from it! He smiles as
          you pay for your cancer sticks and
          says, "Have a nice day."

                    DANTE
          I think you'd better leave now.

                    ACTIVIST
          You want me to leave? Why? Because
          somebody is telling it like it is?
          Somebody's giving these fine people
          a wake-up call?!

                    DANTE
          You're loitering in here, and
          causing a disturbance.

                    ACTIVIST
          You're the disturbance, pal! And
          here...
               (slaps a dollar on
               the counter)
          I'm buying some...what's
          this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
          no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
          a customer engaged in a discussion
          with other customers.

                    LISTENER 2
               (to DANTE)
          Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!

                    ACTIVIST
          Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
          threat we present! He smells the
          changes coming, and the loss of
          sales when the nonsmokers finally
          demand satisfaction. We demand the
          right to breathe cleaner air!

                                             12.


                    LISTENER 3
          Yeah!

                    ACTIVIST
          We'd rather chew our gum than
          embrace slow death! Let's abolish
          this heinous practice of sucking
          poison, and if it means ruffling
          the feathers of a convenience store
          idiot, then so be it!

                    DANTE
          That's it, everybody out.

                    ACTIVIST
          We're not moving! We have a right,
          a constitutional right, to assemble
          and be heard!

                    DANTE
          Yeah, but not in here.

                    ACTIVIST
          What better place than this? To
          stamp it out, you gotta start at
          the source!

                    DANTE
          Like I'm responsible for all the
          smokers!

                    ACTIVIST
          The ones in this town, yes! You
          encourage their growth, their habit.
          You're the source in this area, and
          we're going to shut you down for
          good! For good, cancer-merchant!

     The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

                    CROWD
          Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
          Cancer merchant!

     VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
     cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
     loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
     throng. Everyone turns to face...

     VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
     a fire extinguisher.

                    VERONICA
          Who's leading this mob?

                                             13.


     The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

                    SOMEONE
          That guy.

     The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
     the door.

                    VERONICA (O.C.)
          Freeze.

     VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
     the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

                    VERONICA
          Let's see some credentials.

     He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
     nozzle at him, warningly.

                    VERONICA
          Slowly...

     He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
     it.

                    VERONICA
          You're a Chewlie's Gum
          representative?

     He nods.

                    VERONICA
          And you're stirring up all this
          antismoking sentiment
          to...what?...sell more gum?

     He nods again.

                    VERONICA
               (through gritted teeth)
          Get out of here.

     He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
     exits.

                    VERONICA
               (to the crowd)
          And you people: Don't you have jobs
          to go to? Get out of here and go
          commute.

     The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
     glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

                                             14.


     VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

                    VERONICA
          You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
          Easily led automatons. Try thinking
          for yourself before you pelt and
          innocent man with cigarettes.

     The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
     extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
     floor, head in his folded arms.

                    VERONICA
          It looked like Tiananmen Square in
          here for a second.

     DANTE is silent.

                    VERONICA
          "Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
          from an extremely ugly mob scene."

     DANTE remains silent.

                    VERONICA
               (sits beside him)
          Okay, champ. What's wrong?

     DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

                    VERONICA
          All right, stupid question. But
          don't you think you're taking this
          a bit too hard?

                    DANTE
          Too hard?! I don't have enough
          indignities in my life-people start
          throwing cigarettes at me!

                    VERONICA
          At least they weren't lit.

                    DANTE
          I hate this fucking place.

                    VERONICA
          Then quit. You should be going to
          school anyway...

                    DANTE
          Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
          is a lecture at this point.

                                             15.


                    VERONICA
          All I'm saying is that if you're
          unhappy you should leave.

                    DANTE
          I'm not even supposed to be here
          today!

                    VERONICA
          I know. I stopped by your house and
          your mom said you left at like six
          or something.

                    DANTE
          The guy got sick and couldn't come
          in.

                    VERONICA
          Don't you have a hockey game at two?

                    DANTE
          Yes! And I'm going to play like
          shit because I didn't get a good
          night's sleep!

                    VERONICA
          Why did you agree to come in then?

                    DANTE
          I'm only here until twelve, then
          I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

                    VERONICA
          Why don't you open the shutters and
          get some sunlight in here?

                    DANTE
          Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

                    VERONICA
          You're kidding.

                    DANTE
          Bunch of savages in this town.

                    VERONICA
          You look bushed. What time did you
          get to bed?

                    DANTE
          I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

                    VERONICA
          What were you doing up so late?

                                             16.


                    DANTE
               (skirting)
          Hunhh? Nothing.

                    VERONICA
               (persistent)
          What were you doing?

                    DANTE
          Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
          you now?

                    VERONICA
          Who's fighting? Why are you so
          defensive?

                    DANTE
          Who's defensive? Just...Would you
          just hug me?! All right? Your
          boyfriend was accosted by an angry
          mob, and he needs to be hugged.

     She stares at him.

                    DANTE
          What? What is that?

                    VERONICA
          She called you, didn't she?

                    DANTE
          Oh, be real! Would you...Would you
          please hug me? I just went through
          a very traumatic experience and I
          haven't been having the best day so
          far. Now come on.

     VERONICA stares at him.

                    DANTE
          What? What's with that look?! I
          wasn't talking to anyone, especially
          her! Look at you, being all sort
          of...I don't know...stand-offish.

     VERONICA looks away.

                    DANTE
          Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
          me. I see how it is. All right
          Pissy-pants, you just go on being
          suspicious and quiet. I don't even
          want to hug you at this point.

                                             17.


     VERONICA looks back at him.

                    DANTE
               (pleadingly)
          Give you a dollar?

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

     PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN
     APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.

     DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
     counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
     chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

                    DANTE
               (to O.C. customer)
          Thanks.

     The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.

                    VERONICA
          How much money did you leave up
          there?

                    DANTE
          Like three dollars in mixed change
          and a couple of singles. People
          only get the paper of coffee this
          time of morning.

                    VERONICA
          You're trusting.

                    DANTE
          Why do you say that?

                    VERONICA
          How do you know they're taking the
          right amount of change? Or even
          paying for what they take?

                    DANTE
          Theoretically, people see money on
          the counter and nobody around, they
          think they're being watched.

                    VERONICA
          Honesty through paranoia. Why do
          you smell like shoe polish?

                                             18.


                    DANTE
          I had to use shoe polish to make
          that sign. The smell won't come off.

                    VERONICA
          Do you think anyone can see us down
          here?

                    DANTE
          Why? You wanna have sex or something?

                    VERONICA
               (sarcastic)
          Ooh! Can we?!

                    DANTE
          Really?

                    VERONICA
          I was kidding.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, right. You can't get enough
          of me.

                    VERONICA
          Typically male point of view.

                    DANTE
          How do you figure?

                    VERONICA
          You show some bedroom proficiency,
          and you think you're gods. What
          about what we do for you?

                    DANTE
          Women? Women, as lovers, are all
          basically the same: they just have
          to be there.

                    VERONICA
          "Be there?"

                    DANTE
          Making a male climax is not all
          that challenging: insert somewhere
          close and preferably moist; thrust;
          repeat.

                    VERONICA
          How flattering.

                                             19.


                    DANTE
          Now, making a woman cum...therein
          lies a challenge.

                    VERONICA
          Oh, you think so?

                    DANTE
          A girl makes a guy cum, it's
          standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
          it's talent.

                    VERONICA
          And I actually date you?

                    DANTE
          Something wrong?

                    VERONICA
          I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
          it takes more than that to get a
          guy off. Just "being there"-as you
          put it-is not enough.

                    DANTE
          I touched a nerve.

                    VERONICA
          I'm astonished to hear you
          trivialize my role in our sex life.

                    DANTE
          It wasn't directed at you. I was
          making a broad generalization.

                    VERONICA
          You were making a generalization
          about "broads!"

                    DANTE
          These are my opinions based on my
          experiences with the few women who
          were good enough to sleep with me.

                    VERONICA
          How many?

                    DANTE
          How many what?

                    VERONICA
          How many girls have you slept with?

                                             20.


                    DANTE
          How many different girls? Didn't we
          already have this discussion once?

                    VERONICA
          We might have; I don't remember.
          How many?

                    DANTE
          Including you?

                    VERONICA
          It better be up to and including me.

                    DANTE
               (pause to count)
          Twelve.

                    VERONICA
          You've slept with twelve different
          girls?

                    DANTE
          Including you; yes.

     Pause. She slaps him.

                    DANTE
          What the hell was that for?

                    VERONICA
          You're a pig.

                    DANTE
          Why'd you hit me?

                    VERONICA
          Do you know how many different men
          I've had sex with?

                    DANTE
          Do I get to hit you after you tell
          me?

                    VERONICA
          Three.

                    DANTE
          Three?

                    VERONICA
          Three including you.

                                             21.


                    DANTE
          You've only had sex with three
          different people?

                    VERONICA
          I'm not the pig you are.

                    DANTE
          Who?

                    VERONICA
          You!

                    DANTE
          No; who were the three, besides me?

                    VERONICA
          John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

                    DANTE
               (with true admiration)
          Wow. That's great. That's something
          to be proud of.

                    VERONICA
          I am. And that's why you should
          feel like a pig. You men make me
          sick. You'll sleep with anything
          that says yes.

                    DANTE
          Animal, vegetable, or mineral.

                    VERONICA
          Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

                    DANTE
          They put up the least amount of
          struggle.

                    VERONICA
          After dropping a bombshell like
          that, you owe me. Big.

                    DANTE
          All right. Name it.

                    VERONICA
          I want you to come with me on Monday.

                    DANTE
          Where?

                                             22.


                    VERONICA
          To school. There's a seminar about
          getting back into a scholastic
          program after a lapse in enrollment.

                    DANTE
          Can't we ever have a discussion
          without that coming up?

                    VERONICA
          It's important to me, Dante. You
          have so much potential that just
          goes to waste in this pit. I wish
          you'd go back to school.

                    DANTE
          Jesus, would you stop? You make my
          head hurt when you talk about this.

     VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

                    DANTE
          Shit! Why are we getting up?

                    VERONICA
          Unlike you, I have a class in
          forty-five minutes.

     A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
     VERONICA reacts to him.

                    VERONICA
               (surprised)
          Willam!

                    WILLAM
          Ronnie! How are you? You work here
          now?

                    VERONICA
               (locks arms with DANTE)
          No, I'm just visiting my man.
               (to DANTE)
          Dante, this is Willam Black.
               (to WILLAM)
          This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

                    DANTE
          How are you? Just the soda?

                    WILLAM
          And a pack of cigarettes.
               (to VERONICA; paying)
          Are you still going to Seton Hall?

                                             23.


                    VERONICA
          No, I transferred into Monmouth
          this year. I was tired of missing
          him.
               (squeezes DANTE'S arm)


                    WILLAM
          Do you still talk to Sylvan?

                    VERONICA
          I just talked to her on Monday. We
          still hang out on weekends.

                    WILLAM
               (leaving)
          That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
          take it easy, all right?

                    VERONICA
          I will. Take it easy.

                    WILLAM
          Bye.
               (exits)


                    VERONICA
          Bye
               (to DANTE)
          That was Snowball.

                    DANTE
          Why do you call him that?

                    VERONICA
          Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
          thing.

                    DANTE
          What do you mean?

                    VERONICA
          After he gets a blow job, he likes
          to have the cum spit back into his
          mouth while kissing. It's called
          snowballing.

                    DANTE
          He requested this?

                    VERONICA
          He gets off on it.

                                             24.


                    DANTE
          Sylvan can be talked into anything.

                    VERONICA
          Why do you say that?

                    DANTE
          Like you said-she snowballed him.

                    VERONICA
          Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, right.

                    VERONICA
          I'm serious...

     A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

                    DANTE
          You sucked that guy's dick?

                    VERONICA
          Yeah. How do you think I know he
          liked...

                    DANTE
               (panicky)
          But...but you said you only had sex
          with three guys! You never mentioned
          him!

                    VERONICA
          That's because I never had sex with
          him!

                    DANTE
          You sucked his dick!

                    VERONICA
          We went out a few times. We didn't
          have sex, but we fooled around.

                    DANTE
               (massive panic attack)
          Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
          only slept with three guys?

                    VERONICA
          Because I did only sleep with three
          guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
          just go with people.

                                             25.


                    DANTE
          Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

                    VERONICA
          I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
          understood.

                    DANTE
          I did understand! I understand that
          you slept with three different
          guys, and that's all you said.

                    VERONICA
          Please calm down.

                    DANTE
          How many?

                    VERONICA
          Dante...

                    DANTE
          How many dicks have you sucked?!

                    VERONICA
          Let it go...

                    DANTE
          HOW MANY?

                    VERONICA
          All right! Shut up a second and
          I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't
          freak like this when you told me
          how many girls you fucked.

                    DANTE
          This is different. This is important.
          How many?!

     She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
     a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

                    DANTE
          Well...?

                    VERONICA
               (half-mumbled)
          Something like thirty-six.

                    DANTE
          WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?

                                             26.


                    VERONICA
          Lower your voice!

                    DANTE
          What the hell is that anyway,
          "something like thirty-six?" Does
          that include me?

                    VERONICA
          Um. Thirty-seven.

                    DANTE
          I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?

                    VERONICA
               (walking away)
          I'm going to class.

                    DANTE
          Thirty-seven?!
               (to CUSTOMER)
          My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
          dicks!

                    CUSTOMER
          In a row?

     DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

                    DANTE
          Hey! Where are you going?!

                    VERONICA
          Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
          never even knew how many guys I'd
          slept with, because you never even
          asked. And then you act all
          nonchalant about fucking twelve
          different girls. Well, I never had
          sex with twelve different guys!

                    DANTE
          No, but you sucked enough dick!

                    VERONICA
          Yeah, I went down on a few guys...

                    DANTE
          A few?

                                             27.


                    VERONICA
          ...And one of those guys was you!
          The last one, I might add, which-if
          you're too stupid to comprehend-
          means that I've been faithful to
          you since we met! All the other
          guys I went with before I met you,
          so, if you want to have a complex
          about it, go ahead! But don't look
          at me like I'm the town whore,
          because you were plenty busy
          yourself, before you met me!

                    DANTE
               (a bit more rational)
          Well...why did you have to suck
          their dicks? Why didn't you just
          sleep with them, like any decent
          person?!

                    VERONICA
          Because going down it's a big deal!
          I used to like a guy, we'd make
          out, and sooner or later I'd go
          down on him. But I only had sex
          with the guys I loved.

                    DANTE
          I feel sick.

                    VERONICA
               (holds him)
          I love you. Don't feel sick.

                    DANTE
          Every time I kiss you now I'm going
          to taste thirty-six other guys.

     VERONICA violently lets go of him.

                    VERONICA
          I'm going to school. Maybe later
          you'll be a bit more rational.

                    DANTE
               (pause)
          Thirty-seven. I just can't...

                    VERONICA
          Goodbye, Dante.

     She exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a
     moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out.

                                             28.


                    DANTE
          Try not to suck any more dicks on
          your way through the parking lot!

     Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside
     double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went.

                    DANTE
          HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE!

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips
     repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT
     CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise
     Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
               (pissed off)
          I thought that place was supposed
          to be opened at eleven o'clock?
          It's twenty after!

                    DANTE
          I called his house twice already.
          He should be here soon.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          It's not like it's a demanding job.
          I'd like to get paid to sit on my
          ass and watch TV. The other day I
          walked in there and that sonofabitch
          was sleeping.

                    DANTE
          I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          You calling me a liar?

                    DANTE
          No; he was probably just resting
          his eyes.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          What the hell is that? Resting his
          eyes! It's not like he's some
          goddamned air traffic controller!

                    DANTE
          Actually, that's his night job.

                                             29.


                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack
          wise. That's why you're jockeying a
          register in some fucking local
          convenience store instead of doing
          an honest day's work.
               (tosses tape on counter)
          I got no more time to bullshit
          around waiting for that sonofabitch.
          You make sure this gets back. The
          number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And
          I wanted to get a damn movie, too.

                    DANTE
          If you'll just tell me the title of
          your rental choice, I'll have him
          hold it for you.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
               (storming out)
          Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to
          Big Choice Video instead.

     He storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter.

                    DANTE
               (in a whisper)
          You forgot your keys.

     The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store
     door. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at
     the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug.

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          The guy ain't here yet.

                    RANDAL
          You're kidding. It's almost eleven-
          thirty!

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          I know. I've been here since eleven.

                    RANDAL
               (kicks the door)
          Man! I hate it when I can't rent
          videos!

                                             30.


                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          I would've went to Big Choice, but
          the tape I want is right there on
          the wall.

                    RANDAL
          Which one?

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          Dental School.

                    RANDAL
          You came for that too? That's the
          movie I came for.

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          I have first dibs.

                    RANDAL
          Says who?

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
               (suddenly snotty)
          Says me. I've been here for half an
          hour. I'd call that first dibs.

                    RANDAL
          Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm
          getting that tape.

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          Like hell you are!

                    RANDAL
          I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't
          get to rent that tape.

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          Twenty bucks?

                    RANDAL
          Twenty bucks.

                    V.A. CUSTOMER
          All right, asshole, you're on.

     RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a
     sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up.

     RANDAL dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine. He sees
     DANTE and stops dead, midshuffle.

                    DANTE
          You're late.

                    RANDAL
          What the hell are you doing here? I
          thought you were playing hockey at
          one.

                    DANTE
          The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

                    RANDAL
          Why are the shutters closed?

                    DANTE
          Someone jammed gum in the locks.

                    RANDAL
          Bunch of savages in this town.

                    DANTE
          That's what I said.

                    RANDAL
          Shit, if I'd known you were working,
          I would've come even later.

     A pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a
     single key on top. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his
     head.

                    RANDAL
          What time do you have to stay till?

                    DANTE
          He assured me that he'd be here by
          twelve.

                    RANDAL
          What smells like shoe polish?

                    DANTE

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          Hey-did you see a set of keys lying
          around here?

               (as Short-round)
          No time for love, Doctor Jones!

     RANDAL marches off. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
          Fucking kids.

     The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to
     the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves
     the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as
     RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to
     be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later.
     RANDAL smiles.

     A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone
     heaps ground coffee on it. We've seen this same routine
     before. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters,
     tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He
     picks the cat up.

                    RANDAL
          Some guy just came in refusing to
          pay late fees. He said the store
          was closed for two hours yesterday.
          I tore up his membership.

                    DANTE
          Shocking abuse of authority.

                    RANDAL
          I'm a firm believer in the
          philosophy of a ruling class,
          especially since I rule.

          Is the Pelican flying?

          Don't screw with it. It makes us
          look suspicious.

          I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.

     A far-away wall is the only thing we see, but mild gruntings
     give away an ascension of sorts. RANDAL'S head rises into
     view, as if he's climbing a ladder. He stops and looks into
     the lens.

     The PELICAN is a VCR that's hooked up to a surveillance

          Who was on your phone this morning
          at about two-thirty? I was trying

          Why?

                    RANDAL
          I wanted to use your car.

     He walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at
     it.

                    RANDAL
          Snake cake?

     DANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a
     paper and joins him behind the counter.

          You don't want to know.

          You called Caitlin again?

                    DANTE
          She called me.

                    RANDAL
          Did you tell Veronica?

                    DANTE
          One fight a day with Veronica is
          about all I can stomach, thanks.

                    RANDAL
          What do you two fight about?

                    DANTE
          I guess it's not really fighting.
          She just wants me to leave here, go
          back to school, get some direction.

               (opening paper)
          I'll bet the most frequent topic of
          arguments is Caitlin Bree.

          You win.

                    RANDAL
          I'm going to offer you some advice,
          my friend: let the past be the past.
          Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been
          with Veronica for how long now?

                    DANTE
          Seven months.

                    RANDAL
          Chick's nuts about you. How long
          did you date Caitlin?

                    DANTE
          Five years.

                    RANDAL
          Chick only made you nuts. She
          cheated on you how many times?

                    DANTE
          Eight and a half.

                                             35.


                    RANDAL
               (looks up from paper)
          Eight and a half?

                    DANTE
          Party at John K's-senior year. I
          get blitzed and pass out in his
          bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives
          all over me.

                    RANDAL
          That's cheating?

                    DANTE
          In the middle of it, she calls me
          Brad.

                    RANDAL
          She called you Brad?

                    DANTE
          She called me Brad.

                    RANDAL
          That's not cheating. People say
          crazy shit during sex. One time, I
          called this girl "Mom."

                    DANTE
          I hit the lights and she freaks.
          Turns out she thought I was Brad
          Michaelson.

                    RANDAL
          What do you mean?

                    DANTE
          She was supposed to meet Brad
          Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked
          the wrong one. She had no idea I
          was even at the party.

                    RANDAL
          Oh, my God.

                    DANTE
          Great story, isn't it?

                    RANDAL
          That girl was vile to you.

          Interesting postscript to that
          story: Do you know who wound up
          going with Brad Michaelson in the
          other dark bedroom?

                    RANDAL
          Your mother.

                    DANTE
          Allan Harris.

                    RANDAL
          Chess team Allan Harris?!

                    DANTE
          The two moved to Idaho together
          after graduation. They raise sheep.

                    RANDAL
          That's frightening.

                    DANTE
          It takes different strokes to move
          the world.

                    RANDAL
          In light of this lurid tale, I
          don't see how you could even
          romanticize your relationship with
          Caitlin-she broke your heart and
          inadvertently drove men to deviant
          lifestyles.

                    DANTE
          Because there was a lot of good in
          our relationship.

                    RANDAL
          Oh yeah.

                    DANTE
          I'm serious. Aside from the
          cheating, we were a great couple.
          That's what high school's all
          about-algebra, bad lunch, and
          infidelity.

                    RANDAL
          You think things would be any
          different now?

                                             37.


                    DANTE
          They are. When she calls me now,
          she's a different person-she's
          frightened and vulnerable. She's
          about to finish college and enter
          the real world. That's got to be
          scary for anyone.

                    RANDAL
               (suddenly recalling)
          Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

                    DANTE
          I'm talking to myself here.

                    RANDAL
          No, no, I'm listening. She's
          leaving college, and...?

                    DANTE
          ...and she's looking to me for
          support. And I think that this is
          leading our relationship to a new
          level.

                    RANDAL
          What about Veronica?

                    DANTE
          I think the arguments Veronica and
          I are having are some kind of
          manifestation of a subconscious
          desire to break away from her so
          that I can pursue the possibility
          of a more meaningful relationship
          with Caitlin.

                    RANDAL
          Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

                    DANTE
          I think it's safe to say yes.

                    RANDAL
          Then I think all four of you had
          better sit down and talk it over.

                    DANTE
          All four?

                    RANDAL
          You, Veronica, Caitlin...
               (lays paper flat)
          ...and Caitlin's fiancé.

                                             38.

          press...Hello?...Hello?

     DANTE hangs up. He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his
     head. He then sniffs the air.

     JAY, SILENT BOB and OLAF lean against wall.

                    JAY
          "Not in me." That's what she says.
          I gotta pull out and spank it to
          get it on. So I blow a nut on her
          belly, and I get out of there, just
          as my uncle walks in. It was such a
          close call. I tell you what,
          though, I don't care if she is my
          cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots
          again tonight.

     TWO GIRLS join them.

                    JAY
          Oh shit, look who it is. The human
          vacuum.

                    GIRL 1
          Scumbag. What are you doing?

                    JAY
          Nothing. Just hanging out with
          Silent Bob and his cousin.

                    GIRL 1
               (to SILENT BOB)
          He's your cousin?

                    JAY
          Check this out, he's from Russia.

                    GIRL 1
          No way.

                    JAY
          I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I
          lying?

     SILENT BOB shakes his head:

                    JAY
          See? And Silent Bob never told a
          lie in his life.

                    GIRL 2
          What part of Russia?

                                             42.


                    JAY
          I don't fucking know. What am I,
          his biographer?
               (to OLAF)
          Olaf, what part of Russia are you
          from?

     OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB.

                    SILENT BOB
               (in Russian)
          Home.

                    OLAF
               (comprehending)
          Moscow.

                    GIRL 1
          He only speaks Russian?

                    JAY
          He knows some English, but he can't
          not speak it good like we do.

                    GIRL 2
          Is he staying here?

                    JAY
          He's moving to the big city next
          week. He wants to be a metal singer.

                    GIRL 1
          No way!

                    JAY
          Swear.
               (to OLAF)
          Olaf, metal!

     OLAF makes a metal face.

                    JAY
          That's his fucking metal face.
               (to OLAF)
          Olaf, girls nice?

     OLAF looks the girls up and down.

                    OLAF
          Skrelnick.

                    JAY
               (laughs)
          That's fucked up.

                                             43.


                    GIRL 1
          What did he say?

                    JAY
          I don't know, man. He's a fucking
          character.

                    GIRL 2
          He really wants to play metal?

                    JAY
          He's got his own band in Moscow.
          It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue
          Jeans" or something like that.

                    GIRL 1
          That doesn't sound metal.

                    JAY
          You gotta hear him sing.
               (to OLAF)
          Olaf, "Berserker!"

     OLAF laughs and shakes his head.

                    JAY
          Come on, man, "Berserker!"

                    GIRL 2
          Does he sing in English or Russian?

                    JAY
          English.
               (to OLAF)
          Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think
          sexy.

                    OLAF
               (relents)
          Da. Da.

                    JAY
          He's gonna sing it. This is too
          funny.

                    OLAF
               (in broken English)
          MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK

          MAKING FUCK? BERSERKER!

                    JAY
               (laughing)
          That's fucking funny, man!

                                             44.


                    GIRL 1
          Did he say "making fuck?"

                    JAY
          Wait, there's more.
               (to OLAF)
          Olaf: sing...
               (makes pot-smoking face)


                    OLAF

     DANTE is tugging at a can of Pringles potato chips. The can
     is stuck on a MAN'S hand.

                    DANTE
          You hold the counter and I'll pull.

                    MAN
          Usually I just turn the can upside
          down.

                                             45.


                    DANTE
               (pulling)
          Maybe we should soap your hand or
          something.

                    MAN
               (straining)
          They oughta put some kind of
          warning on these cans, like they do
          with cigarettes.

                    DANTE
          I think it's coming now...

     The can pops off and DANTE staggers back a few steps. The
     man rubs his hand.

                    MAN
          Thanks. I thought I was gonna have
          to go to the hospital.

                    DANTE
          I'll throw this out. Precautionary
          measure.

                    MAN
          It stings a little.

                    DANTE
          A word of advice: Sometimes it's
          best to let those hard to reach
          chips go.

     DANTE steps behind the counter.

                    MAN
          Thanks.

     The MAN exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister
     away.

                    DANTE
          Do you know that article is accurate?
          Caitlin's really getting married!

                    RANDAL
          You know what I just watched?

                    DANTE
          Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really
          is getting married.

                    RANDAL
          Which did you like better: Jedi or
          The Empire Strikes Back.

                    DANTE
               (exasperated)
          Empire.

                    RANDAL
          Blasphemy.

                    DANTE
          Empire had the better ending: Luke
          gets his hand cut off, and finds
          out Vader's his father; Han gets
          frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.
          It ends on such a down note. And
          that's life-a series of down
          endings. All Jedi had was a bunch
          of Muppets.

                    RANDAL
          There was something else going on
          in Jedi. I never noticed it until
          today.

     RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

                    DANTE
          What's that?

                    RANDAL
          All right, Vader's boss...

                    DANTE
          The Emperor.

                    RANDAL
          Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
          is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?

                    DANTE
          How do you mean?

                    RANDAL
          Well, he's like the pope for the
          dark side of the Force. He's a holy
          man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
          evil one.

                                             47.


                    DANTE
          I guess.

                    RANDAL
          Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
          The Imperial government is under
          his control. And the entire galaxy
          is under Imperial rule.

                    DANTE
          Yeah.

                    RANDAL
          Then wouldn't that logically mean
          that it's a theocracy? If the head
          of the Empire is a priest of some
          sort, then it stands to reason that
          the government is therefore one
          based on religion.

                    DANTE
          It would stand to reason, yes.

                    RANDAL
          Hence, the Empire was a fascist
          theocracy, and the rebel forces
          were therefore battling religious
          persecution.

                    DANTE
          More or less.

                    RANDAL
          The only problem is that at no
          point in the series did I ever hear
          Leia or any of the rebels declare a
          particular religious belief.

                    DANTE
          I think they were Catholics.

     A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door.

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Are you open?

                    DANTE
          Yeah. Come in.

     He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.

                    RANDAL
          You know what else I noticed in Jedi?

                                             48.


                    DANTE
          There's more?

                    RANDAL
          So they build another Death Star,
          right?

                    DANTE
          Yeah.

                    RANDAL
          Now the first one they built was
          completed and fully operational
          before the Rebels destroyed it.

                    DANTE
          Luke blew it up. Give credit where
          it's due.

                    RANDAL
          And the second one was still being
          built when they blew it up.

                    DANTE
          Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

                    RANDAL
          Something just never sat right with
          me the second time they destroyed
          it. I could never put my finger on
          it-something just wasn't right.

                    DANTE
          And you figured it out?

                    RANDAL
          Well, the thing is, the first Death
          Star was manned by the Imperial
          army-storm troopers, dignitaries-
          the only people onboard were
          Imperials.

                    DANTE
          Basically.

                    RANDAL
          So when they blew it up, no prob.
          Evil is punished.

                    DANTE
          And the second time around...?

                                             49.


                    RANDAL
          The second time around, it wasn't
          even finished yet. They were still
          under construction.

                    DANTE
          So?

                    RANDAL
          A construction job of that magnitude
          would require a helluva lot more
          manpower than the Imperial army had
          to offer. I'll bet there were
          independent contractors working on
          that thing: plumbers, aluminum
          siders, roofers.

                    DANTE
          Not just Imperials, is what you're
          getting at.

                    RANDAL
          Exactly. In order to get it built
          quickly and quietly they'd hire
          anybody who could do the job. Do
          you think the average storm trooper
          knows how to install a toilet main?
          All they know is killing and white
          uniforms.

                    DANTE
          All right, so even if independent
          contractors are working on the
          Death Star, why are you uneasy with
          its destruction?

                    RANDAL
          All those innocent contractors
          hired to do a job were killed-
          casualties of a war they had
          nothing to do with.
               (notices Dante's confusion)
          All right, look-you're a roofer,
          and some juicy government contract
          comes your way; you got the wife
          and kids and the two-story in
          suburbia-this is a government
          contract, which means all sorts of
          benefits. All of a sudden these
          left-wing militants blast you with
          lasers and wipe out everyone within
          a three-mile radius.

                    RANDAL (CONT'D)
          You didn't ask for that. You have
          no personal politics. You're just
          trying to scrape out a living.

     The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them.

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Excuse me. I don't mean to
          interrupt, but what were you
          talking about?

                    RANDAL
          The ending of Return of the Jedi.

                    DANTE
          My friend is trying to convince me
          that any contractors working on the
          uncompleted Death Star were innocent
          victims when the space station was
          destroyed by the rebels.

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm
          a roofer...
               (digs into pocket and
               produces business card)
          Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
          And speaking as a roofer, I can say
          that a roofer's personal politics
          come heavily into play when choosing
          jobs.

                    RANDAL
          Like when?

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Three months ago I was offered a
          job up in the hills. A beautiful
          house with tons of property. It was
          a simple reshingling job, but I was
          told that if it was finished within
          a day, my price would be doubled.
          Then I realized whose house it was.

                    DANTE
          Whose house was it?

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Dominick Bambino's.

                    RANDAL
          "Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?

                                             51.


                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          The same. The money was right, but
          the risk was too big. I knew who he
          was, and based on that, I passed
          the job on to a friend of mine.

                    DANTE
          Based on personal politics.

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
          Right. And that week, the Foresci
          family put a hit on Babyface's
          house. My friend was shot and
          killed. He wasn't even finished
          shingling.

                    RANDAL
          No way!

                    BLUE-COLLAR MAN
               (paying for coffee)
          I'm alive because I knew there were
          risks involved taking on that
          particular client. My friend wasn't
          so lucky.
               (pauses to reflect)
          You know, any contractor willing to
          work on that Death Star knew the
          risks. If they were killed, it was
          their own fault. A roofer listens
          to this...
               (taps his heart)
          not his wallet.

     The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain
     respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the
     door and pokes her head in.

                    WOMAN
          Is that video store open or not?

                              CUT TO:

     INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

     RANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the
     two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to
     the other repeatedly.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (attempting a solicit help)
          They say so much, but they never
          tell you if it's any good.

                                             52.


     RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The
     INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was
     even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different
     approach.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          Are either of these any good?

     RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries
     harder, then louder and more direct:

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          Sir!

     RANDAL continues to read.

                    RANDAL
               (flatly)
          What.

     The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (politely)
          Are either of these any good?

     RANDAL, as always, reads on.

                    RANDAL
               (again, flatly)
          I don't watch movies.

     The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put
     off.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          Well, have you heard anything about
          either of them?

     RANDAL does his level best to not get involved.

                    RANDAL
               (reading)
          No.

     The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (in disbelief)
          You've never heard anybody say
          anything about either movie?

                                             53.


                    RANDAL (O.C.)
          I find it's best to stay out of
          other people's affairs.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (with a new determination)
          Well, how about these two movies?
               (holds up the same two)


     RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

                    RANDAL
          They suck.

     The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his
     paper. She has caught him.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          I just held up the same two movies.
          You're not even paying attention.

                    RANDAL
          No, I wasn't.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          I don't think your manager would
          appreciate...

                    RANDAL
               (turning the page)
          I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          I beg your pardon!

                    RANDAL
               (reading on)
          Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
          trick me.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (defending herself)
          I only pointed out that you weren't
          paying any attention to what I was
          saying.

                    RANDAL
               (turning page and reading)
          I hope it feels good.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
          You hope what feels good?

                                             54.


                    RANDAL
          I hope it feels so good to be right.
          There is nothing more exhilarating
          than pointing out the shortcomings
          of others, is there?

     The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
     disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
     clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
     disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE
     CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies
     back onto the wall.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (in a huff)
          Well this is the last time I ever
          rent here...

                    RANDAL
          You'll be missed.

                    INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
               (losing it altogether)
          Screw you!

     She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter
     and whips the door open.

                    RANDAL
               (calling after her)
          You're not allowed to rent here
          anymore!

     RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily,
     totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

                    RANDAL
          Screw me!

     He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.
     Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside,
     gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the
     opposite direction from the woman.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL
     hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.

                    RANDAL
          You'll never believe what this
          unruly customer just said...

                                             55.


                    DANTE
               (a hand up to urge
               him to hush)
          Wait.

                    RANDAL
               (looking around)
          She's in here?

                    DANTE
          This guy is going through all of
          the eggs. Look.

     An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,
     all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it
     open, and examines each egg carefully.

                    DANTE (O.C.)
          This has been going on for twenty
          minutes.

     RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

                    RANDAL
          What's he looking for?

                    DANTE
          He said he has to find a perfect
          dozen.

                    RANDAL
          Perfect dozen.

                    DANTE
          Each egg has to be perfect.

                    RANDAL
          The quest isn't going well?

                    DANTE
          Obviously not. Look at all the
          cartons that didn't make the grade.

     The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
     several different angles.

                    RANDAL (O.C.)
          Why doesn't he just mix and match?

                    DANTE
          I told him that and he yelled at me.

     RANDAL snickers at his friend.

                                             56.


                    RANDAL
          What did he say?

                    DANTE
          He said it was important to have
          standards. He said nobody has pride
          anymore.

                    RANDAL
          It's not like you laid the eggs
          yourself.

                    DANTE
          I'll give him five more minutes
          then I'm calling the cops. I don't
          need this, man. I'm not even
          supposed to be here today.

     A SMOKER steps in.

                    SMOKER
          Two packs of cigarettes.

     Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and
     searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and
     then at the O.C. oddity.

     The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER
     looks at RANDAL.

                    RANDAL
               (still staring at the
               ODD MAN)
          I'm as puzzled as you.

                    SMOKER
               (paying DANTE)
          I've actually seen it before.

                    DANTE
          You know him?

                    SMOKER
          No, I've seen that behavior before.
          Looking for the perfect carton of
          eggs, right?

                    RANDAL
               (a bit astonished)
          Yeah. How'd you know?

                    SMOKER
          I'll bet you a million bucks that
          the guy's a guidance counselor.

                                             57.


                    DANTE
          Why do you say that?

                    SMOKER
          I was in the Food City last year
          when the same thing happened,
          different guy though. Stock boy
          told me that the guy had been
          looking through the eggs for like
          half an hour, doing all sorts of
          endurance tests and shit. I ask the
          kid how come nobody called the
          manager, and he says it happens
          twice a week, sometimes more.

                    RANDAL
          Get out of here.

                    SMOKER
          I kid you not. They call it Shell
          Shock. Only happens with guidance
          counselors for some reason. The kid
          said they used to make a big deal
          about it, but there's no point.

     The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.
     He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
     still sitting on the floor.

                    SMOKER (O.C.)
          He said they always pay for whatever
          they break and they never bother
          anybody.

     DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

                    DANTE
          Why guidance counselors?

                    SMOKER
          If your job served as little
          purpose as theirs, wouldn't you
          lose it, too?

                    RANDAL
          Come to think of it, my guidance
          counselor was kind of worthless.

                    SMOKER
               (grabbing matches)
          See? It's important to have a job
          that makes a difference, boys.
          That's why I kill Chinamen for the
          railroad.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     POV RANDAL: THE EMPTY COUNTER

     And then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding
     money. She can't be any more than five.

                    LITTLE GIRL
               (innocently)
          Can I have a pack of cigarettes?

     RANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the
     transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth.
     RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as
     the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun.

                    DANTE
          Did you ever notice all the prices
          end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.

                    RANDAL
          You know how much money the average
          jizz-mopper make per hour?

                    DANTE
          What's a jizz-mopper?

                    RANDAL
          He's the guy in those nudie-booth
          joints who cleans up after each guy
          that jerks off.

                    DANTE
          Nudie booth?

                    RANDAL
          Nudie booth. You've never been in a
          nudie booth?

                    DANTE
          I guess not.

     A female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings
     her up.

                    RANDAL
          Oh, it's great. You step into this
          little booth and there's this
          window between you and this naked
          woman, and she puts on this little
          show for like ten bucks.

                    DANTE
          What kind of show?

                                             59.


                    RANDAL
          Think of the weirdest, craziest
          shit you'd like to see chicks do.
          These chicks do it all. They insert
          things into any opening in their
          body...any opening.
               (to customer)
          He's led a very sheltered life.

                    DANTE
               (indicating CUSTOMER)
          Can we talk about this later?

                    RANDAL
          The jizz-mopper's job is to clean
          up the booths afterward, because
          practically everybody shoots a load
          against the window, and I don't
          know if you know or not, but cum
          leaves streaks if you don't clean
          it right away.

                    CUSTOMER
               (grabbing her bag, disgusted)
          This is the last time I come to
          this place.

                    DANTE
          Excuse me?

                    CUSTOMER
          Using filthy language in front of
          the customers...you should both get
          fired.

                    DANTE
          We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little
          carried away.

                    CUSTOMER
          Well, I don't know if sorry can
          make up for it. I found your
          remarks highly offensive.

     The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something.

                    RANDAL
          Well, you think that's offensive...

     RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic
     picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread
     wide open.

                                             60.


                    RANDAL
          ...then check this out. I think you
          can see her kidneys.

     RANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically
     apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER.

                    DANTE
          Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please,
          wait a second, ma'am...

     The CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter.
     DANTE turns on RANDAL.

                    DANTE
          Why do you do things like that? You
          know she's going to come back and
          tell the boss.

                    RANDAL
          Who cares? That lady's an asshole.
          Everybody that comes in here is way
          too uptight. This job would be
          great if it wasn't for the fucking
          customers.

          I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.

                    RANDAL
          You gotta loosen up, my friend.
          You'd feel a hell of a lot better
          if you'd rip into the occasional
          customer.

                    DANTE
          What for? They don't bother me if I
          don't bother them.

                    RANDAL
          Liar! Tell me there aren't customers
          that annoy the piss out of you on a
          daily basis.

                    DANTE
          There aren't.

                    RANDAL
          How can you lie like that? Why
          don't you vent? Vent your
          frustration. Come on, who pisses
          you off?

          It's not really anyone per se, it's
          more of separate groupings.

     foil.

          What happened to home by twelve?

     DANTE is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under
     her arm.

                    DANTE
          He still hasn't shown up. Why
          aren't you in class?

                    VERONICA

          home and brought you some lunch.

                    VERONICA
          Peanut butter and jelly with the

          able to deal.

     RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C.

                    DANTE
               (to O.C.)
          Why don't you go back to the video
          store?

     RANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He
     exits.

                    VERONICA
          You had to tell him.

                    DANTE
          I had to tell someone. He put it
          into perspective.

                    VERONICA
          What did he say?

                    DANTE
          At least he wasn't thirty-six.

                    VERONICA
          And that made you feel better?

                    DANTE
          And he said most of them are
          college guys, I've never met or seen.

          ...it isn't there. Yes.

                    VERONICA
          Thank you for being rational.

          Thank you for the lasagne.

                    VERONICA
          You couldn't get these shutters open?

                    DANTE
          I called a locksmith and he said
          the earliest he could get here it
          tomorrow.

                    VERONICA
          Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back
          for the one-thirty class.

                    DANTE
          What time do you get finished?

                    VERONICA
          Eight. But I have a sorority
          meeting till nine, so I'll be back
          before you close. Can we go out and
          get some coffee?

                    DANTE
          Sure.

                    VERONICA
          Good.
               (kisses him)
          I'll see you when you close, then.
          Enjoy the lasagne.

     She exits. DANTE leans against the magazine rack with his
     lasagne, contemplative. RANDAL pops his head in and makes

          I know.

                    RANDAL
          That seems to be the leitmotif in

          I don't back down.

                    RANDAL
          Yes, you do. You always back down.
          You assume blame that isn't yours,
          you come in when called as opposed
          to enjoying your day off, you
          buckle like a belt.

          You know what pisses me off the most?

                    RANDAL
          The fact that I'm right about your
          buckling?

                    DANTE
          I'm going to miss the game.

                    RANDAL
          Because you buckled.

                    DANTE
          Would you shut the hell up with
          that shit? It's not helping.

          What? What do you want?!

     DANTE shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone

                    DANTE
          I've got a responsibility here. I
          can't let everybody grab free drinks.

                    SANFORD
          What responsibility? You're closing
          the fucking store to play hockey.

                    RANDAL
          He's blunt, but he's got a point.

                    DANTE
          At least let me maintain some
          semblance of managerial control here.

                    SANFORD
          All I'm saying is if you're going
          to be insubordinate, you should go
          the full nine and not pussy out
          when it comes to free refreshments.

                    RANDAL
          He's right. As if we're suddenly
          gonna have a run on Gatorade.

                                             71.


                    SANFORD
          Fuckin-A.

                    DANTE
          All right. Jesus, you fuckers are
          pushy.

                    SANFORD
          Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying
          an Asian drum major.

                    RANDAL
          Design major.

                    DANTE
          Can we not talk about this?

                    SANFORD
          Fine by me. But you're living in
          denial and suppressing rage.
               (skating away; to all)
          Dante said we can all drink free
          Gatorade.

     A laid-back hurrah is heard.

                    RANDAL
          Are you gonna lock the store?

                    DANTE
          I don't know. You going to lock the
          video store?

                    RANDAL
          Look who you're asking here. How're
          we gonna block off the street?

                    DANTE
          We're not playing in the street.

                    RANDAL
          Then where're we gonna play?

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     The sign on the door reads:

     TEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD.

     The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one.
     ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More
     players join them.

                                             72.


     From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a
     store with many men gliding around on the roof.

     On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.
     REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls
     his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD
     skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and
     SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge
     and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the
     center of the court.

                    DANTE
          Ready?

     PLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and
     holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off,
     and the ball is in play.

     The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.
     Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots
     are taken, CU's of various players included.

     INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
     sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting
     scored on and more face-offs.

     Below, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He
     reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting
     to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

     Below, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
     impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

     Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
     the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
     he watches for a moment before calling out.

                    CUSTOMER
          When's this period over?

                    SOMEONE (O.C.)
          Eight more minutes!

                    CUSTOMER
          Are you shitting me? I want to get
          cigarettes!

     DANTE skids to the sidelines.

                    DANTE
               (out of breath)
          If you can just wait a few more
          minutes.

                                             73.


                    CUSTOMER
          Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy
          neck on this ladder!

                    SOMEONE (O.C.)
          Dante! Where are you?!

                    CUSTOMER
          He's busy!

     DANTE starts to skate away.

                    DANTE
          I'll be right back. It's almost over.

     He jumps back into the game.

                    CUSTOMER
          What the fuck is this?! I want some
          service!

                    DANTE (O.C.)
          In a second!

                    CUSTOMER
          Fuck in a second! This is...Look at
          you! You can't even pass!

                    DANTE (O.C.)
          I can pass!

                    CUSTOMER
          How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

     DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

                    DANTE
          Who are you to make assessments?

                    CUSTOMER
          I'll assess all I want!

                    SOMEONE (O.C.)
          DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!

                    CUSTOMER
               (to O.C. SOMEONE)
          Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!
               (to DANTE)
          You suck!

                    DANTE
          Like you're better!

                                             74.


                    CUSTOMER
          I can whip your ass.

     Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,
     face against the glass.

                    DANTE (O.C.)
          That's easy to say from over here.

                    CUSTOMER (O.C.)
          Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
          knock your fucking teeth out and
          pass all over your ass.

     The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the
     roof.

                    WOMAN
          Is the convenience store open?

     Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

                    DANTE AND CUSTOMER
               (simultaneously)
          NO!

                    DANTE
               (to CUSTOMER)
          There's a stick over there. You're
          shooting against the goal.
               (to the court)
          REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
          ON!

     A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
     drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
     winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the
     court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls
     to the sidelines.

                    DANTE
          Give me another ball.

                    SOMEONE (O.C.)
          There are no more.

                    DANTE
          What the fuck are you talking about?
          How many balls did you bring?

     SANFORD skates up to him.

                                             75.


                    SANFORD
               (counting)
          There was the orange ball...and the
          orange ball.

     DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

                    DANTE
          Are there any balls down there?!

                    JAY (O.C.)
          'Bout the biggest pair you ever
          seen! NYNNE!!

     DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

                    DANTE
          You only brought one ball?!

                    SANFORD
          I thought Redding had like three
          balls!

                    REDDING (O.C.)
          I thought Dante had the balls.

                    DANTE
          Nobody has another ball?

                    SANFORD
          Shit!

                    DANTE
          We get...what...twelve minutes of
          game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
          Fuck! Fuck!!
               (pause; rubs head)
          I'm not even supposed to be here
          today!

     DANTE skates off.

                    SANFORD
          We still get free Gatorade, right?

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     DANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An
     OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder.

                    OLD MAN
          Be careful.

                                             76.


                    DANTE
          I'm trying.

                    OLD MAN
          You know the insides of those are
          filled with stuff that gives you
          cancer.

                    DANTE
          So I'm told.

                    OLD MAN
          I had a friend that used to chew
          glass for a living. In the circus.

     The light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it.

                    DANTE
          And he got cancer by chewing
          fluorescent bulb glass...?

                    OLD MAN
          No, he got hit by a bus.

                    DANTE
               (confused)
          Oh...Can I help you?

                    OLD MAN
          Well, that depends. Do you have a
          bathroom?

                    DANTE
          Um...yeah, but it's for employees
          only.

                    OLD MAN
          I understand, but can I use it. I'm
          not that young anymore, so I'm kind
          of...you know...incontinent.

                    DANTE
          Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back
          through the cooler.

                    OLD MAN
          Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet
          paper you got back there?

                    DANTE
          The white kind.

                                             77.


                    OLD MAN
          I'm not asking about the color. I
          mean is it rough or cottony?

                    DANTE
          Actually, it is kind of rough.

                    OLD MAN
          Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell
          out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would
          you mind if I took a roll of the
          soft stuff back there. I see you
          sell the soft stuff.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, but...

                    OLD MAN
          Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference?
          You said yourself the stuff that's
          there now is rough.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

                    OLD MAN
          Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

     The OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The
     OLD MAN returns.

                    OLD MAN
          Say, young fella, you know I hate
          to bother you again, but can I take
          a paper or something back there...to
          read? It usually takes me a while,
          and I like to read while it's going
          on.

                    DANTE
          Jesus...go ahead.

                    OLD MAN
          Thanks, young man. You've got a
          heart of gold.

     The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines.
     He comes back to the counter.

                    DANTE
          You know, you probably could've
          been home, already, in the time
          it's taken you to get in there.

                                             78.


                    OLD MAN
          Can I trouble you for one of those
          magazines?

                    DANTE
          I said go ahead.

                    OLD MAN
          No, I mean the ones there. Behind
          the counter.

     DANTE glances over and reacts.

                    DANTE
          The porno mags?

                    OLD MAN
          Yeah. I like the cartoons. They
          make me laugh. They draw the
          biggest titties.

                    DANTE
               (hands one to him)
          Here. Now leave me alone.

                    OLD MAN
          Uh, can I have the other one. The
          one below this one. They show more
          in that one.

     DANTE makes the switch.

                    OLD MAN
          Thanks son. I appreciate this.

     The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close,
     then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE.

                    RANDAL
          Helluva game!

                    DANTE
          One ball!! They come all the way
          here...I close the damn store...for
          one ball!

                    RANDAL
          Hockey's hockey. At least we got to
          play.

                    DANTE
          Randal, twelve minutes is not a
          game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!

                                             79.


                    RANDAL
          Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want
          something to drink?
               (walking away)


                    DANTE
          Gatorade.

     Pause. Then...

                    RANDAL (O.C.)
          What happened to all the Gatorade?

                    DANTE
          Exactly. They drank it all.

                    RANDAL (O.C.)
          After an exhausting game like that
          I can believe it.

                    DANTE
               (as RANDAL)
          "It's not like we're gonna sell
          out."

     RANDAL comes back with drinks.

                    RANDAL
          You know what Sanford told me?
               (offering drink)


                    DANTE
          I still can't believe Caitlin's
          getting married.

                    RANDAL
          Julie Dwyer died.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, right.

                    RANDAL
          No, I'm serious.

     DANTE is visibly taken aback.

                    DANTE
          Oh, my god.

                    RANDAL
          Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
          He found out this morning.

                                             80.


                    DANTE
          How? When?

                    RANDAL
          Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

                    DANTE
          Jesus.

                    RANDAL
          She was swimming at the YMCA pool
          when it happened. Died midbackstroke.

                    DANTE
          I haven't seen her in almost two
          years.

                    RANDAL
          Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
          she one of the illustrious twelve?

                    DANTE
          Number six.

                    RANDAL
          You've had sex with a dead person.

                    DANTE
          I'm gonna go to her wake.

                    RANDAL
          No, you're not.

                    DANTE
          Why not?

                    RANDAL
          It's today.

                    DANTE
          What!?

                    RANDAL
          Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next
          show is at four.

                    DANTE
          Shit. What about tomorrow?

                    RANDAL
          One night only. She's buried in the
          morning.

                                             81.


                    DANTE
          You've gotta watch the store. I
          have to go to this.

                    RANDAL
          Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred
          to you that I might bereaved as well?

                    DANTE
          You hardly knew her!

                    RANDAL
          True, but do you know how many
          people are going to be there? All
          of our old classmates, to say the
          least.

                    DANTE
          Stop it. This is beneath even you.

                    RANDAL
          I'm not missing what's probably
          going to be the social event of the
          season.

                    DANTE
          You hate people.

                    RANDAL
          But I love gatherings. Isn't it
          ironic?

                    DANTE
          Don't be an asshole. Somebody has
          to stay with the store.

                    RANDAL
          If you go, I go.

                    DANTE
          She meant nothing to you!

                    RANDAL
          She meant nothing to you either
          until I told you she died.

                    DANTE
          I'm not taking you to this funeral.

                    RANDAL
          I'm going with you.

                    DANTE
          I can't close the store.

                                             82.


                    RANDAL
          You just closed the store to play
          hockey on the roof!

                    DANTE
          Exactly, which means I can't close
          it for another hour so we can both
          go to a wake.

                              CUT TO:

     INT CAR: DAY

     DANTE drives with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera.

                    RANDAL
          You were saying?

                    DANTE
          Thanks for putting me in a tough
          spot. You're a good friend.

     Silence. Then...

                    RANDAL
          She was pretty young, hunhh?

                    DANTE
          Twenty-two; same as us.

                    RANDAL
          An embolism in a pool.

                    DANTE
          An embarrassing way to die.

                    RANDAL
          That's nothing compared to how my
          cousin Walter died.

                    DANTE
          How'd he die?

                    RANDAL
          Broke his neck.

                    DANTE
          That's embarrassing?

                    RANDAL
          He broke his neck trying to suck
          his own dick.

     Absolute silence. Then...

                                             83.


                    DANTE
          Shut the hell up.

                    RANDAL
          Bible truth.

                    DANTE
          Stop it.

                    RANDAL
          I swear.

                    DANTE
          Oh, my god.

                    RANDAL
          Come on. Haven't you ever tried to
          suck your own dick?

                    DANTE
          No!

                    RANDAL
          Yeah sure. You're so repressed.

                    DANTE
          Because I never tried to suck my
          own dick?

                    RANDAL
          No, because you won't admit to it.
          As if a guy's a fucking pervert
          because he tries to go down on
          himself. You're as curious as the
          rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

                    DANTE
          Who found him?

                    RANDAL
          My cousin? My aunt found him. On
          his bed, doubled over himself with
          his legs on top. Dick in his mouth.
          My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

                    DANTE
          His dick was in his mouth?

                    RANDAL
          Balls resting on his lips.

                    DANTE
          He made it, hunhh?

                                             84.


                    RANDAL
          Yeah, but at what a price.

     Silence. Then...

                    DANTE
          I could never reach.

                    RANDAL
          Reach what?

                    DANTE
          You know.

                    RANDAL
          What, your dick?

                    DANTE
          Yeah. Like you said, you know. I
          guess everyone tries it, sooner of
          later.

                    RANDAL
          I never tried it.

     DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...

                    RANDAL
          Fucking pervert.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

     DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor.

                    DANTE
          I know it was a bad idea to close
          the store.

                    RANDAL
          Listen to you.

                    DANTE
          I can't help it. At least when we
          were playing hockey outside, I
          could see if anyone wanted to go in.

                    RANDAL
          Nobody's there. It's four o'clock
          on a Saturday. How many people ever
          come to the store at four on a
          Saturday?

                              CUT TO:

                                             85.


     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

     DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by
     a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.
     The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the
     middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely
     nobody is outside.

                    DANTE
               (furious)
          I can't fucking believe you!!

                    RANDAL
          I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

                    DANTE
          You knocked the fucking casket
          over, for Chrissakes!

                    RANDAL
          I was just leaning on it! It was an
          accident!

                    DANTE
          Does anyone ever knock over a
          casket on purpose?

                    RANDAL
          So the casket fell over! Big deal!

                    DANTE
          Her fucking body fell out!

                    RANDAL
          So they'll put her back in! It's
          not like it's gonna matter if she
          breaks something!

                    DANTE
               (opening door)
          Just...go! Go open the video store.

                                             86.


                    JAY (O.C.)
               (mimicking)
          Yeah! Open the video store!!

                    RANDAL
               (to O.C.)
          Shut the fuck up, junkie!

     JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt
     at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

                    DANTE
               (to RANDAL)
          Go open the video store.

                    JAY
          Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

                    DANTE
               (to JAY)
          How many times I gotta tell you not
          to deal outside the store.

                    JAY
          I'm not dealing.

     A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

                    KID
          You got anything, man?

                    JAY
          Yeah, what do you want?

     RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience
     store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the
     IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears,
     flashlight in hand, scanning the ground.

                    IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
               (to JAY)
          Hey, did you see a set of keys
          lying around here somewhere?

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

                    RANDAL
          Let me borrow your car.

                                             87.


                    DANTE
          I don't want to talk to you.

                    RANDAL
          Fine. Just lend me your car.

                    DANTE
          Why should I loan you my car?

                    RANDAL
          I want to rent a movie.

                    DANTE
               (pause)
          You want to rent a movie.

     DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

                    RANDAL
          What's that for?

                    DANTE
          You work in a video store!

     They head back to the counter.

                    RANDAL
          I work in a shitty video store. I
          want to go to a good video store so
          I can rent a good movie.

                    CUSTOMER
          Are you open?

                    DANTE AND RANDAL
               (simultaneously)
          YES!

     The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

                    CUSTOMER
          Pack of cigarettes.
               (pets cat)
          Cute cat. What's its name?

                    RANDAL
          Annoying Customer.

     The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.
     DANTE puts up cigarettes.

                                             88.


                    DANTE
          Can you imagine being halfway
          decent to the customers at least
          some of the time?

                    RANDAL
          Let me borrow your car.

                    DANTE
               (calmer)
          May I be blunt with you?

                    RANDAL
          If you must.

                    DANTE
          We are employees of Quick Stop
          Convenience and RST video,
          respectively. As such, we have
          certain responsibilities which-
          though it may seem cruel and
          unusual-does include manning our
          posts until closing.

                    RANDAL
          I see. So playing hockey and
          attending wakes-these practices are
          standard operating procedure.

                    DANTE
          There's a difference. Those were
          obligations. Obligations that could
          not have been met at any later date.
          Now renting videos-that's just
          gratuitous, not to mention
          illogical, considering you work in
          a video store.

     Another CUSTOMER leans in.

                    CUSTOMER
          Are you open?

                    DANTE
               (rolls his eyes)
          Yes.

                    RANDAL
          You know what? I don't think I care
          for you rationale.

                                             89.


                    DANTE
          It's going to have to do for now,
          considering that it's my car that's
          up for request.
               (to CUSTOMER)
          Can I help you?

                    CUSTOMER
          Pack of cigarettes.

                    RANDAL
          What's your point?

                    DANTE
          My point is that you're a clerk,
          paid to do a job. You can't just do
          anything you want while you're
          working.

                    CUSTOMER
               (reading tabloid)
          "Space Alien Revealed as Head of
          Time Warner; Reports Stock
          Increase."
               (to DANTE and RANDAL)
          They print any kind of shit in
          these papers.

                    DANTE
          They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

                    RANDAL
          So your argument is that title
          dictates behavior?

                    DANTE
          What?

                    RANDAL
          The reasons you won't let me borrow
          your care is because I have a title
          and a job description, and I'm
          supposed to follow it, right?

                    DANTE
          Exactly.

                    CUSTOMER
               (interjecting)
          I saw one, one time, that said the
          world was ending the next week.
                    (MORE)

                                             90.


                    CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
          Then in the next week's paper, they
          said we were miraculously saved at
          the zero hour by a Koala-fish
          mutant bird. Crazy shit.

                    RANDAL
               (eyes the CUSTOMER, annoyed)
          So I'm no more responsible for my
          own decisions while I'm here at
          work than, say, the Death Squad
          soldiers in Bosnia?

                    DANTE
          That's stretching it. You're not
          being asked to slay children or
          anything.

                    RANDAL
          Not yet.
               (sips water)


                    CUSTOMER
               (again with the interjections)
          And I remember this one time the
          damn paper said...

     RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
     The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from
     over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.
     DANTE plays block.

                    CUSTOMER
          I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
          YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

                    DANTE
          Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
          it! He was trying to get me.

                    CUSTOMER
          Well, he missed!

                    DANTE
          I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
          your cigarette money, and we'll
          call it even.

                                             91.


                    CUSTOMER
               (considerably calmer;
               takes money)
          This is the last time I ever come
          here.
               (to RANDAL)
          And if I ever see you again, I'm
          gonna break your fucking head open!

     The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL
     salutes him.

                    DANTE
               (angrily)
          What the fuck did you do that for?

                    RANDAL
          Two reasons: one, I hate when the
          people can't shut up about the
          stupid tabloid headlines.

                    DANTE
          Jesus!

                    RANDAL
          And two, to make a point: title
          does not dictate behavior.

                    DANTE
          What?

                    RANDAL
          If title dictated my behavior, as a
          clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
          be allowed to spit a mouthful of
          water at that guy. But I did, so my
          point is that people dictate their
          own behavior. Hence, even though
          I'm a clerk in this video store, I
          choose to go rent videos at Big
          Choice.
               (extends opened palm)
          Agreed?

                    DANTE
               (shakes his head;
               hands over keys)
          You're a danger to both the dead
          and the living.

                    RANDAL
          I like to think I'm a master of my
          own destiny.

                                             92.


                    DANTE
          Please, get the hell out of here.

                    RANDAL
          I know I'm your hero.

     RANDAL exits.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

     DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of
     milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

                    TRAINER
          Sounds to me like somebody needs to
          hit the gym.

                    DANTE
          Excuse me?

                    TRAINER
          I heard you strain when you put the
          milk in the bag. That milk only
          weighs about seven pounds.

                    DANTE
          I didn't strain. I sighed.

                    TRAINER
          I don't think so. That was a grunt;
          a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
          in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
          trainer. I know what that sound
          signifies: you're out of shape.

                    DANTE
          I don't think so.

                    TRAINER
          Oh, I do. You made the same noise
          when you reached across the counter
          for my cash. Your muscles are thin
          and sadly underutilized.

                    DANTE
          They are not.

                    TRAINER
          Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

                                             93.


                    DANTE
          What are you talking about? There's
          no fat on this body.

                    TRAINER
          No fat, but no tone either. You
          don't get enough exercise.

     A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

                    HEATHER
          Are you open?

                    DANTE
          Yes.

                    HEATHER
               (grabs a paper)
          Just the paper.

                    DANTE
               (to HEATHER)
          Thirty-fire.

                    TRAINER
               (to HEATHER)
          Let me ask you a question: Do you
          think this guy's out of shape?

                    HEATHER
               (studies DANTE)
          I don't know. I can't really tell
          from here.

                    TRAINER
          He is.

                    DANTE
          I am not.

                    TRAINER
          How much can you bench?

                    DANTE
          I don't know.

                    HEATHER
               (studying DANTE)
          I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

                    DANTE
          I know I can bench more than that!

                                             94.


                    TRAINER
          I think the lady called it.

                    HEATHER
          My ex-boyfriend was about his
          height, but he was much bulkier. He
          could bench two-fifty, three
          hundred easy.

                    TRAINER
          I do about three-fifty, four.

                    HEATHER
          No way!

                    TRAINER
               (rolling up sleeve)
          Feel that.

                    HEATHER
          That's tight. Solid.

                    TRAINER
          Now feel his.
               (to DANTE)
          Roll up your sleeve, chief.

                    DANTE
          Oh for God's sake!

                    TRAINER
          See? You're ashamed. You know
          you're out of shape. Take my card.
          I can help you tone that body up in
          no time. Get you on an aerobics and
          free-weights program.

     A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter.

                    SUITED MAN
          You open?

                    DANTE
               (to MAN)
          Yes.
               (to TRAINER)
          I'm not out of shape.

                    SUITED MAN
          Excuse me, but have you been here
          all day?

                    DANTE
          What?

                                             95.


                    HEATHER
               (still studying DANTE)
          He's got those love handles.

                    DANTE
               (to HEATHER)
          I don't have love handles.

                    SUITED MAN
          Were you working here at about four
          o'clock?

                    DANTE
          I've been here since six o'clock
          this morning. Why?

                    TRAINER
               (to HEATHER)
          It's probably from being around all
          this food every day.

                    HEATHER
          Oh, I know. If I had to work here
          all day, I'd be bloated and out of
          shape, too.

                    DANTE
          I'm not out of shape!

                    SUITED MAN
          Can I have your name please?

                    DANTE
          Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

     The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

                    HEATHER
          You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
          didn't even recognize you!

                    TRAINER
          Because he's out of shape.

                    DANTE
          Do I know you?

                    HEATHER
          You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
          out with...

                    DANTE
          Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

                                             96.


                    HEATHER
          I'm her sister.

                    DANTE
          You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?

                    HEATHER
          Yep. I remember you got caught in
          my parents' room with Caitlin once.

                    TRAINER
          Did you say Caitlin Bree?

                    DANTE
          Yeah.

                    TRAINER
          Pretty girl, about this girl's
          height-dark hair-gorgeous body?

                    DANTE
          Yeah?

                    TRAINER
          And your name is Dante Hicks? You
          went to high school with her? You
          played hockey?

                    DANTE
          How do you know that?

                    TRAINER
          Oh man! Hey, you still going out
          with her?

                    DANTE
          No, she's getting married.

                    TRAINER
          To you?

                    HEATHER
          To an Asian design major.

                    TRAINER
          Shit!
               (to DANTE)
          Don't take this the wrong way, but
          I used to fuck her.

                    DANTE
          What?

                                             97.


                    TRAINER
          While you two were dating in high
          school. We're talking four, five
          years ago, back when I drove a
          Trans-Am.

                    HEATHER
          Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

                    TRAINER
          Yeah!

                    DANTE
          You know him?

                    HEATHER
          Caitlin used to talk about him all
          the time.

                    TRAINER
          Really?

                    HEATHER
          Oh yeah. You were the built older
          guy with the black Trans and the
          big...

                    DANTE
          Wait a second!
               (to TRAINER)
          You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
          While I was dating her?

                    TRAINER
          All the time. That girl was like a
          rabbit.

                    DANTE
          I...I don't believe this...

                    HEATHER
               (to TRAINER)
          I still remember Caitlin telling us
          about that time you two went to
          that motel-the one with the mirrors
          and the hot tub in the room.

                    DANTE
          THE GLADES MOTEL?

                                             98.


                    TRAINER
          Holy shit! She told you about that!
               (to DANTE)
          Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
          watched the whole thing. They used
          to film people at that hotel;
          nobody knew about it.

                    HEATHER
          She said one time you set up a tent
          on the beach and you guys did it in
          the middle of this big rainstorm.

                    DANTE
          What? When? When did all this shit
          happen?

                    TRAINER
          Hey man, that was a long time ago.
          Don't let it get to you.

                    HEATHER
          I'm surprised you never found out
          about it, Dante. Everybody in
          school knew-even in my class.

                    DANTE
          Jesus Christ, what next?

     The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and
     hands it to DANTE.

                    SUITED MAN
          Here you go.

                    DANTE
          What's this?

                    SUITED MAN
          A fine, for five hundred dollars.

                    DANTE
          WHAT?

                    TRAINER
          Five hundred bucks? What for?

                    SUITED MAN
          For violation of New Jersey Statute
          Section Two A, number one-seventy
          slash fifty-one: Any person who
          sells or makes available tobacco or
          tobacco-related products to persons
          under the age of eighteen is
          regarded as disorderly.

                                             99.


                    DANTE
          What are you talking about?

                    SUITED MAN
          According to the NJAC-the New
          Jersey Administrative Code, section
          eighteen, five, slash twelve point
          five-a fine of no less than two
          hundred and fifty dollars is to be
          leveled against any person reported
          selling cigarettes to a minor.

                    DANTE
          I didn't do that!

                    SUITED MAN
          You said you were here all day?

                    DANTE
          Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
          to any kids!

                    SUITED MAN
          An angry mother called the state
          division of taxation and complained
          that the man working at Quick Stop
          Convenience sold her five-year-old
          daughter cigarettes today at around
          four o'clock. Division of taxation
          calls the State Board of Health,
          and they send me down here to issue
          a fine. You say you were working
          all day, hence the fine is yours.
          It's doubled due to the incredibly
          young age of the child.

                    DANTE
          But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
          kid!

                    TRAINER
          To a five-year-old kid? What a
          scumbag!

                    HEATHER
          That's sick, Dante.

                    DANTE
          I didn't sell cigarettes to any
          kids! I swear!

                                             100.


                    SUITED MAN
          The due date is on the bottom. This
          summons cannot be contested in any
          court of law. Failure to remit
          before the due date will result in
          a charge of criminal negligence,
          and a warrant will be issued for
          your arrest. Have a nice day.

     The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

                    DANTE
          But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
          kids! Hey!

                    TRAINER
               (takes back the card)
          Forget it. I don't want to deal
          with a guy that sells cigarettes to
          a five-year-old.
               (to HEATHER)
          Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

                    HEATHER
          Sure. How about the beach?

                    TRAINER
          I like the way you think.

     The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his
     forehead.

                    DANTE
          Jesus! What next?

                    VOICE (O.C.)
          Dante?

     DANTE spins, angrily.

                    DANTE
          What?

          That's the price, my brother.

                    JOHN
          Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.

                    JAY
          For this kind of hash, you need
          that kind of cash.

                    JOHN
          How long you gonna be here?

                    JAY
          Till ten. Then I'm going to John
          K's party.

                    JOHN
          You're gonna be at John K's party?

                    JAY
               (to SILENT BOB)
          My man is deaf.
               (yelling)
          I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!
               (quieter)
          Neh.

                    JOHN
          Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm
          gonna get the cash and buy it from
          you at John K's. You're gonna bring
          it, right?

                    JAY
          The only place I don't bring my
          drugs is church. And that ain't
          till Sunday morning.

                    JOHN
          Yo. I'll see you at that party.
               (puts his hand up to
               be slapped)
          I'll see you there?

                    JAY
               (reluctantly slapping hands)
          I'll see you there.

     DANTE and CAITLIN are embracing very tightly. We hold on
     them for a few seconds, just to let it sink in. Then...

                    DANTE
          When did you get back?

                    CAITLIN
          Just now.

                    DANTE
          My God. I haven't seen you since...
               (he hugs her again)


                    CAITLIN
          Dante. You've got a customer.

     DANTE hops behind the counter. A customer pays for something
     while DANTE continues to talk.

                    CAITLIN
          I just saw Alyssa's little sister
          outside. She was with Rick Derris.

                    DANTE
          Let's not talk about that. How'd
          you get home?

                    CAITLIN
          Train. It took eight hours.

                    DANTE
          I can't believe you're here.

     Another customer comes to the counter.

                    CUSTOMER
          Excuse me, do you have...

                                             103.

          How long are you staying?

                    CAITLIN
          Until Monday. Then I have to take
          the train back.

     Yet another customer comes to the counter.

                    CUSTOMER
          Pack of cigarettes.
               (to CAITLIN)
          Congratulations. I saw that
          announcement in today's paper.
               (to DANTE)
          She's marrying an Asian design major.

                    DANTE

          Man, it's fucking slow.

     SILENT BOB walks out of the frame, leaving JAY alone against
     the wall. He comes back a few seconds later, carrying a
     mini-Walkman with ten-watt speakers. He sets it down on the
     ground and turns it on. House music starts playing. Jay-
     possessed by the beat-breaks into an impromptu dance, in
     which he makes suggestive and often lewd moves. SILENT BOB

          You're just going to lock the store
          like that?

          I want to talk to you about

                    CAITLIN
          You saw it?

                    DANTE
          Very dramatic, I thought.

                    CAITLIN
          It's not what you think.

                    DANTE
          What, it's worse? You're pregnant
          with an Asian design major's child?

                    CAITLIN
          I'm not pregnant.

                    DANTE
          Were you going to tell me or just
          send me an invitation?

                    CAITLIN
          I was going to tell you. But then
          we were getting along so well, I
          didn't want to mess it up.

                    DANTE
          You could've broke it to me gently,
          you know; at least started by
          telling me you had a boyfriend. I
          told you I have a girlfriend.

                    CAITLIN
          I know, I'm sorry. But when we
          started talking...it's like I
          forgot I had a boyfriend. And then
          he proposed last month...

                    DANTE
          And you said yes?

                    CAITLIN
          Well...kind of, sort of?

                    DANTE
          Is that what they teach you at that
          school of yours? Kind of, sort of?
          Everyone knows about this except me!
          Do you know how humiliating that is?

                    CAITLIN
          I would've told you, and you would
          have stopped calling, like a baby.

                                             105.


                    DANTE
          How do you know that?

                    CAITLIN
          Because I know you. You prefer
          drastic measures to rational ones.

                    DANTE
          So you're really getting married?

                    CAITLIN
          No.

                    DANTE
          No, you're not really getting
          married?

                    CAITLIN
          The story goes like this: He
          proposed, and I told him I had to
          think about it, and he insisted I
          wear the ring anyway. Then my
          mother told the paper we were
          engaged.

                    DANTE
          How like her.

                    CAITLIN
          Then my mother called me this
          morning and told me the announcement
          was in the paper. That's when I
          hopped the train to come back here,
          because I knew you'd be a wreck.

                    DANTE
          Thanks for the vote of confidence.

                    CAITLIN
          Was I right?

                    DANTE
          Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is
          more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

                    CAITLIN
          I love a macho façade. It's such a
          turn-on.
               (sniffing air)
          What smells like shoe polish?

                    DANTE
          And you came here to what? To
          comfort me?

                                             106.


                    CAITLIN
          The last thing I needed was for you
          to think I was hiding something
          from you.

                    DANTE
          But you were.

                    CAITLIN
          No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
          you'd I'd been seeing other people.

                    DANTE
          Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
          you're ready to walk down the
          aisle-I'd say that constitutes
          something more than just seeing
          somebody.

                    CAITLIN
          I'm giving him his ring back.

                    DANTE
          What?

                    CAITLIN
          I don't want to marry him. I don't
          want to get married now. I'm on the
          verge of graduation. I want to go
          to grad school after this. And then
          I want to start a career. I don't
          want to be a wife first, and then
          have to worry about when I'' going
          to fit in all of the other stuff.
          I've come way too far and studied
          too hard to let my education go to
          waste as a housewife. And I know
          that's what I'd become. Sang's
          already signed with a major firm,
          and he's going to be pulling a huge
          salary, which would give me no
          reason to work, and he's so
          traditional anyway...

                    DANTE
          Sang? His name is a past tense?

                    CAITLIN
          Stop it. He's a nice guy.

                    DANTE
          If he's so nice, why aren't you
          going to marry him?

                                             107.


                    CAITLIN
          I just told you.

                    DANTE
          There's more, isn't there?

                    CAITLIN
          Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

                    DANTE
          Tell me I don't have something to
          do with it.

                    CAITLIN
          You don't have anything to do with
          it.

                    DANTE
          You lie.

                    CAITLIN
          Look how full of yourself you are.

                    DANTE
          I just believe in giving credit
          where credit is due. And I believe
          that I'm the impetus behind your
          failure to wed.

                    CAITLIN
          If I'm so nuts about you, then why
          am I having sex with an Asian
          design major?

                    DANTE
          Jesus, you're caustic.

                    CAITLIN
          I had to bring you down from that
          cloud you were floating on. When I
          say I don't want to get married, I
          mean just that. I don't want to
          marry anybody. Not for years.

                    DANTE
          So who's asking? I don't want to
          marry you.

                    CAITLIN
          Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

                    DANTE
          Buy can we date?

                                             108.


                    CAITLIN
          I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would
          like that.

                    DANTE
          We could introduce them. They might
          hit it off.

                    CAITLIN
          You're serious. You want to date
          again.

                    DANTE
          I would like to be your boyfriend,
          yes.

                    CAITLIN
          It's just the shock of seeing me
          after three years. Believe me,
          you'll get over it.

                    DANTE
          Give me a bit more credit. I think
          it's time we got back together, you
          know. I'm more mature, you're more
          mature, you're finishing college,
          I'm already in the job market...

                    CAITLIN
          You work in a market, all right.

                    DANTE
          Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
          go out again. After all the talking
          we've been doing.

                    CAITLIN
          The key word here is talk, Dante. I
          think the idea, the conception of
          us dating is more idyllic than what
          actually happens when we date.

                    DANTE
          So...what? So we should just make
          pretend over the phone that we're
          dating?

                    CAITLIN
          I don't know. Maybe we should just
          see what happens.

                    DANTE
          Let me take you out tonight.

                                             109.


                    CAITLIN
          You mean, on a date?

                    DANTE
          Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

                    CAITLIN
          The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
          Date. I think I've been on that one
          before.

                    DANTE
          You have a better suggestion?

                    CAITLIN
          How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
          the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
          Somewhere Kind of Private Date?

                    DANTE
          I hear that's a rather popular date.

                    CAITLIN
               (hits him)
          Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
          you, succumbing to your wily
          charms, and you call me a slut, in
          so many words.

                    DANTE
          What about Sing?

                    CAITLIN
          Sang.

                    DANTE
          Sang.

                    CAITLIN
          He's not invited.

                    DANTE
          He's your fiancé.

                    CAITLIN
          I offer you my body and you offer
          me semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
          Dante, and in case you haven't
          gotten the drift of why I came all
          the way here from Ohio, I'm about
          to become single again.

          And yes-let me placate your ego-you
          are the inspiration for this bold
          and momentous decision, for which
          I'll probably be ostracized at both
          school and home. You ask me who I
          choose, I choose you.

                    DANTE
          So what are you saying?

                    CAITLIN
          You're such an asshole.

                    DANTE
          I'm just kidding.

                    CAITLIN
          I can already tell this isn't going
          to work.

          I'll ask Randal to close up for me-
          when he gets back.

                    CAITLIN
          Where'd he go? I'd have thought
          he'd be at your side, like an
          obedient lapdog.

                    DANTE
          He went to rent a movie, but he
          hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw
          it; I'll just lock the store up and
          leave him a note.

                    CAITLIN
          You're too responsible. But no. I
          have to go home first. They don't
          even know I left school. And I
          should break the disengagement news
          to my mother, which is going to
          cause quite a row, considering she
          loves Sang.

                    DANTE
          Who doesn't?

                    CAITLIN
          Well, me I guess.
               (gathering herself to go)
          So, I shall take my leave of you,
          but I will return in a little
          while, at which time-yes-I would
          love to go for dinner and a movie
          with you.

                                             111.


                    DANTE
          What happened to the walk and the
          nakedness?

                    CAITLIN
          I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.
               (she kisses his cheek)
          See you later, handsome.

     DANTE watches her leave. He then explodes in jubilance.

                    DANTE
          YES!

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     DANTE looks ahead, dreamily, half-spinning in his chair.
     RANDAL enters carrying videos.

                    RANDAL
          Get to work.

                    DANTE
               (takes videos)
          What'd you rent?
               (reads)
          Best of Both Worlds?

                    RANDAL
          Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with
          both organs. You should see the
          box: Beautiful women with dicks
          that put mine to shame.

                    DANTE
          And this is what you rented?

                    RANDAL
          I like to expand my horizons.

                    DANTE
          I got fined for selling cigarettes
          to a minor.

                    RANDAL
          No way!

                    DANTE
          Five hundred dollars.

                    RANDAL
          You're bullshitting.

                                             112.


     DANTE hands him the summons. RANDAL reads it.

                    RANDAL
          I didn't think they even enforced
          this.

                    DANTE
               (points to himself)
          Living proof.

                    RANDAL
          I thought you never sold cigarettes
          to kids.

                    DANTE
          I don't; you did.

                    RANDAL
               (pause)
          Really?

                    DANTE
          Little girl. Maybe five years old?

                    RANDAL
               (taken aback)
          Holy shit. That girl?

                    DANTE
          As opposed to the hundreds of other
          children you let buy cigarettes
          whenever you work here.

                    RANDAL
          Then how come you got the fine?

                    DANTE
          Because I'm here.

                    RANDAL
               (incredulous)
          You're lying.

                    DANTE
          I swear. I couldn't make this kind
          of hell up.

                    RANDAL
          Then why aren't you like screaming
          at me right now?

                    DANTE
          Because I'm happy.

                                             113.


                    RANDAL
          You're happy?

                    DANTE
          I'm happy.

                    RANDAL
          You're happy to get a fine?

                    DANTE
          No. I'm happy because Caitlin came
          to see me.

                    RANDAL
          Now I know you're lying.

                    DANTE
          I'm not. She just left.

                    RANDAL
          What did she say?

                    DANTE
          She's not going to marry that guy.
          She went home to tell her mother.

                    RANDAL
          You're kidding.

                    DANTE
          I'm not.

                    RANDAL
               (takes it in for a moment)
          Wow. You've had quite an evening.

                    DANTE
          She went home, she's getting ready,
          and we're going out.

                    RANDAL
          I feel so ineffectual. Is there
          anything I can do for you?

                    DANTE
          Watch the store while I go home and
          change.

                    RANDAL
          What happened to title dictates
          behavior?

                                             114.


                    DANTE
          This is my way of spitting water at
          life.

                    RANDAL
               (suddenly aware)
          Hey, what about Veronica?

                    DANTE
          No! Don't bring it up. I don't want
          to think about that now. Let me
          enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll
          think about all of that later. In
          the meantime, nobody mentions the V
          word.

                    RANDAL
          You're a snake.

                    DANTE
          In my absence, try not to sell
          cigarettes to any newborns.

                    RANDAL
          You want me to bring the VCR over
          here so we can watch this?

                    DANTE
          I might be leaving early to go out
          with Caitlin, in which case you'll
          have to close the store tonight.

                    RANDAL
          All right, but you're missing out.
          Chicks with dicks.

                    DANTE
               (puts cats on counter)
          I'll read the book.

     DANTE exits. A CUSTOMER comes back to the counter. He pets
     the cat.

                    CUSTOMER
          Cute cat. What's his name.

                    RANDAL
          Peptic ulcer.

                              CUT TO:

                                             115.


     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     JAY and SILENT BOB watch as DANTE passes. A small group of
     burners are poised around the store door. JAY carefully
     writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker.
     SILENT BOB hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large
     piece of paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off
     a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store
     door. It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK!
     Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his
     face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he
     is saying he eats cock. The small group laughs hysterically.

                              CUT TO:

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     CAITLIN enters, carrying an overnight bag. RANDAL is watching
     his porno. The porno is loud and lewd. CAITLIN stares.

                    CAITLIN
          Randal Graves-scourge of the video
          renter.

                    RANDAL
          Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian
          Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!

                    CAITLIN
          You saw that article? God, isn't it
          awful? My mother sent that in.

                    RANDAL
          I take it she likes the guy.

                    CAITLIN
          You'd think she was marrying him.
          What are you watching?

                    RANDAL
          Children's programming. What did
          your mom say when you told her you
          weren't engaged anymore?

                    CAITLIN
          She said not to come home until
          graduation.

                    RANDAL
          Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

                    CAITLIN
          What can I say? He does weird
          things to me.

                                             116.


                    RANDAL
          Can I watch?

                    CAITLIN
          You can hold me down.

                    RANDAL
          Can I join in?

                    CAITLIN
          You might be let down. I'm not a
          hermaphrodite.

                    RANDAL
          Few are. So what makes you think
          you can maintain a relationship
          with Dante this time around?

                    CAITLIN
          A woman's intuition. Something in
          me says it's time to give the old
          boy a serious try.

                    RANDAL
          Wow. Hey, I was just about to order
          some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?

                    CAITLIN
          Dick.

                    RANDAL
          Exactly.

                    CAITLIN
          So where is he?

                    RANDAL
          He went home to change for the big
          date.

                    CAITLIN
          God, isn't he great?

                    RANDAL
               (indicating TV)
          No, this is great.

                    CAITLIN
          Can I use the bathroom?

                    RANDAL
          There's no light back there.

                                             117.


                    CAITLIN
          Why aren't there any lights?

                    RANDAL
          Well, there are, but for some
          reason they stop working at five-
          fourteen every night.

                    CAITLIN
          You're kidding.

                    RANDAL
          Nobody can figure it out. And the
          boss doesn't want to pay the
          electrician to fix it, because the
          electrician owes money to the video
          store.

                    CAITLIN
          Such a sordid state of affair.

                    RANDAL
          And I'm caught in the middle-torn
          between my loyalty for the boss,
          and my desire to piss with the
          light on.

                    CAITLIN
          I'll try to manage.

     She heads toward the back.

                    RANDAL
          Hey Caitlin...
               (cautionary)
          Break his heart again this time,
          and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.

                    CAITLIN
          You're very protective of him,
          Randal. You always have been.

                    RANDAL
          Territoriality. He was mine first.

                    CAITLIN
               (rubs his head)
          Awww. That was so cute.

     She kisses his forehead and walks away. The MOTHER and SMALL
     CHILD (Happy Scrappy) come to the counter.

                                             118.


                    MOTHER
               (oblivious of the TV)
          A pack of cigarettes.

     The SMALL CHILD points at the TV screen.

                    SMALL CHILD
          Cunt!

                              CUT TO:

     EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     RANDAL studies the I EAT COCK word balloon. DANTE enters.

                    DANTE
          Who eats cock?

                    RANDAL
          Bunch of savages in this town.
               (recalling)
          Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You
          might want to see if she's okay;
          she's been back there a long time.

                    DANTE
          There's no lights back there.

                    RANDAL
          I told her that. She said she
          didn't need any. Why don't you join
          her, man. Make a little bathroom
          bam-bam.

                    DANTE
          I love your sexy talk. It's
          so...kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.

                    RANDAL
          Fuck you.

     The cooler down is heard opening. CAITLIN walks lazily down
     the convenience store aisle. She looks very satisfied. DANTE
     and RANDAL regard her curiously. She joins them, latching on
     to DANTE's arm, lovingly.

                    CAITLIN
          How'd you get here so fast?

                    DANTE
          I left like an hour ago.

                                             119.


                    CAITLIN
               (regards him curiously)
          Do you always talk weird after you
          violate women?

     RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused.

                    RANDAL
          Maybe the Asian design major
          slipped her some opium?

                    DANTE
          Could be.

                    CAITLIN
               (hugging DANTE)
          Promise me it'll always be like that.

                    DANTE
          Like what?

                    CAITLIN
          When you just lie perfectly still
          and let me do everything.

                    DANTE
          Um...okay.

                    RANDAL
          Am I missing something here?

                    CAITLIN
          I went back there, and Dante was
          already waiting for me.

                    RANDAL
          He was?

                    CAITLIN
          It was so cool. He didn't say a
          word. He was just...ready, you know?
          And we didn't kiss or talk or
          anything. He just sat there and let
          me do all the work.

                    RANDAL
               (to DANTE)
          You dog! I didn't see you go back
          there.

     DANTE is bewildered.

                                             120.


                    CAITLIN
          And the fact that there weren't any
          lights made it so...
               (she lets out a growl
               and hugs DANTE)
          God! That was so great!

                    DANTE
               (quietly)
          It wasn't me.

                    CAITLIN
               (laughing it off)
          Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?

                    DANTE
               (to RANDAL)
          Was it you?

                    RANDAL
          I was here the whole time.

                    CAITLIN
               (half-laughing)
          You two better quit it.

                    DANTE
          I'm serious.

                    CAITLIN
               (beat)
          We didn't just have sex in the
          bathroom?

                    DANTE
          No.

     Everyone is silent. Then...

                    CAITLIN
          Stop this. This isn't funny.

                    DANTE
          I'm not kidding. I just got back
          from outside.

                    CAITLIN
               (covering her chest)
          This isn't fucking funny, Dante!

                    DANTE
          I'm not fooling around!
               (to RANDAL)
          Who went back there?

                                             121.


                    RANDAL
          Nobody! I swear!

                    CAITLIN
          I feel nauseous.

                    DANTE
          Are you sure somebody was back there?

                    CAITLIN
               (hits DANTE)
          I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus,
          I'm going to be sick!

                    RANDAL
          You just fucked a total stranger?

                    DANTE
          Shut the fuck up!

                    CAITLIN
          I can't believe this! I feel faint...

                    DANTE
               (to RANDAL)
          Call the police.

                    RANDAL
          Why?

                    CAITLIN
          No, don't!

                    DANTE
          There's a strange man in our
          bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!

                    CAITLIN
               (weakly)
          Oh God...

                    RANDAL
          She said she did all the work.

                    DANTE
          WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?
               (pause)

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. LATER

     THE OLD MAN'S FACE is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a
     stretcher. (Same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom.)

                    CORONER (O.C.)
          Who is he?

     The body bag zipper is pulled closed. DANTE, the CORONER,
     and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. The
     CORONER takes notes.

                    DANTE
          I don't know. He just came in and
          asked to use the bathroom.

                    CORONER
          What time was this?

                    DANTE
          Um...I don't know.
               (to RANDAL)
          What time did hockey end?

                    RANDAL
          Around three or something.

                    DANTE
          What time did we go to the funeral?

                    RANDAL
          I think four.

                    CORONER
          Wait a second? Who was working here
          today?

                    DANTE
          Just me.

                    CORONER
          I thought you just said you played
          hockey and went to a funeral.

                    DANTE
          We did.

                    CORONER
          Then who operated the store?

                    DANTE
          Nobody. It was closed.

                                             123.


                    CORONER
          With this guy locked in?

                    DANTE
          Everything happened at once. I
          guess I forgot he was back there.

     Ambulance attendants join them.

                    ATTENDANT 1
          Can we take this now?

                    CORONER
          Go ahead.

     The stretcher is wheeled out. Midway down the body bag,
     something protrudes, pushing the bag up. It is an erection.
     RANDAL stares at it.

                    DANTE
          Was he alive when...Caitlin...

                    CORONER
          No. I place the time of death at
          about three-twenty.

                    RANDAL
          Then how could she...you know...

                    CORONER
          The body can maintain an erection
          after expiration. Sometimes for
          hours. Did he have the adult
          magazine when he came in?

                    DANTE
          No. I gave it to him.

     RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief.

                    DANTE
          Well he asked me for it!

                    CORONER
               (continuing)
          I can't say for certain until we
          get him back to the lab, but my
          guess is he was masturbating, his
          heart seized and he died. That's
          when the girl found him.
               (sniffing the air)
          Something smells like shoe polish.

                                             124.


                    RANDAL
               (to CORONER)
          This has gotta be the weirdest
          thing you've ever been called in on.

                    CORONER
               (writing)
          Actually, I once had to tag a kid
          that broke his neck trying to put
          his mouth on his penis.

     RANDAL looks down, anonymously.

                    DANTE
          What about Caitlin?

                    CORONER
          Shock trauma. She's going to need
          years of therapy after this. My
          question is, How did she come to
          have sex with the dead man?

                    DANTE
          She thought it was me.

     The CORONER stares at DANTE.

                    CORONER
          What kind of convenience store do
          you run here?

     He exits. DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor.

                    RANDAL
               (beat)
          Do you think he was talking about
          my cousin?

     INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

     A jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip. Once in the
     condiment, the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin.
     Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly
     to and fro across the jar.

                    RANDAL (O.C.)
               (mumbling Jaws theme)
          Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM! DA-
          DUM! DA-DUM!

     DANTE and RANDAL are on a freezer case. RANDAL pushes this
     chip around the jar of salsa. DANTE stares up at the ceiling,
     oblivious.

                    RANDAL
          Salsa shark.

     DANTE says nothing.

                    RANDAL
               (as Brody)
          "We're gonna need a bigger boat."

     DANTE says even less than nothing.

                    RANDAL
               (as Quint)
          "Man goes into the cage; cage goes
          into the salsa; shark's in the
          salsa; our shark."

     DANTE...you know.

                    RANDAL
               (angry)
          What? What's with you? You haven't
          said anything for like twenty
          minutes. What the hell is your
          problem?

                    DANTE
          This life.

                    RANDAL
          This life?

                    DANTE
          Why do I have this life?

                    RANDAL
          Have some chips; you'll feel better.

                                             126.


                    DANTE
          I'm stuck in this pit, earning less
          than slave wages, working on my day
          off, dealing with every backward
          fuck on the planet, the goddam
          steel shutters are locked all day,
          I smell like shoe polish, I've got
          an ex-girlfriend who's catatonic
          after fucking a dead guy, and my
          present girlfriend has sucked
          thirty-six dicks.

          Thirty-seven.

                    DANTE
          My life is in the shitter right
          about now, so if you don't mind,

     RANDAL hops off the freezer case and steps O.C.

                    RANDAL (O.C.)

          I should shit or get off the pot.

                    RANDAL
          Yeah, you should shit or get off
          the pot.

                    DANTE
          What are you talking about?

                    RANDAL
          I'm talking about this thing you
          have...this inability to improve
          your situation in life.

                                             127.


                    DANTE
          Fuck you.

                    RANDAL
          It's true. You'll sit there and
          blame life for dealing a cruddy
          hand, never once accepting the
          responsibility for the way your
          situation is.

                    DANTE
          What responsibility?

                    RANDAL
          All right, if you hate this job and
          the people, and the fact that you
          have to come in on your day off,
          then quit.

                    DANTE
          As if it's that easy.

                    RANDAL
          It is. You just up and quit. There
          are other jobs, and they pay better
          money. You're bound to be qualified
          for at least one of them. So what's
          stopping you?

                    DANTE
          Leave me alone.

                    RANDAL
          You're comfortable. This is a life
          of convenience for you, and any
          attempt to change it would shatter
          the pathetic microcosm you've
          fashioned for yourself.

                    DANTE
          Oh, like your life's any better?

                    RANDAL
          I'm satisfied with my situation for
          now. You don't hear me bitching.
          You, on the other hand, have been
          bitching all day.

                    DANTE
          Thank you. Why don't you go back to
          the video store?

                    RANDAL
          It's the same thing with Veronica.

                                             128.


                    DANTE
          Leave her out of this.

                    RANDAL
          You date Veronica because she's low
          maintenance and because it's
          convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever
          do is talk about Caitlin. You carry
          a torch for a girl you dated in
          high school-in high school for
          God's sake! You're twenty-two!

                    DANTE
          Leave me alone.

                    RANDAL
          If you want Caitlin, then face
          Veronica, tell her, and be with
          Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be
          with Veronica. But don't pine for
          one and fuck the other. Man, if you
          weren't such a fucking coward...

                    DANTE
          ...If I wasn't such a fucking
          coward.
               (chuckles)
          It must be so great to be able to
          simplify everything the way you do.

                    RANDAL
          Am I right or what?

                    DANTE
          You're wrong. Things happened
          today, okay? Things that probably
          ruined my chances with Caitlin.

                    RANDAL
          What? The dead guy? She'll get over
          fucking the dead guy. Shit, my
          mom's been fucking a dead guy for
          thirty years; I call him Dad.

                    DANTE
          Caitlin and I can't be together.
          It's impossible.

                    RANDAL
          Melodrama coming from you seems
          about as natural as an oral bowel
          movement.

                    DANTE
          What do you want me to say? Yes, I
          suppose some of the things you're
          saying may be true. But that's the
          way things are; it's not going to
          change.

                    RANDAL
          Make them change.

                    DANTE
          I can't, all right! Jesus, would
          you leave me alone? I can't make
          changes like that in my life. If I
          could, I would-but I don't have the
          ability to risk comfortable
          situations on the big money and the
          fabulous prizes.

                    RANDAL
          Who're you kidding? You can so.

                    DANTE
          Jesus H. Christ, I can't!

                    RANDAL
          So you'll continue being miserable
          all the time, just because you
          don't have the guts to face change?

                    DANTE

          My mother told me once that when I
          as three, my potty lid was closed,
          and instead of lifting it, I chose
          to shit my pants.

                    RANDAL
          Lovely story.

                    DANTE
          Point is-I'm not the kind of person
          that disrupts things in order to
          shit comfortably.

          Drinking beers!
               (to DANTE)
          A pack of wraps, my good man. It's
          time to kick back, drink some
          beers, and smoke some weed!

                    DANTE
          Done poisoning the youth for the day?

                    JAY
          Hell yes, whatever that means. Now
          I'm gonna head over to Atlantic,
          drink some beers, get ripped, and-
          please God-get laid.
               (pulls out money)
          E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.

                    DANTE
          One seventy-nine.

                    JAY
               (to SILENT BOB)
          Pay the good man.
               (to DANTE)
          Don't you close soon?

                    DANTE
          A half hour.

                    JAY
          We get off about the same time
          every night. We should hang out.
          You get high?

                    DANTE
          I should start.

                    JAY
          Wanna come to this party tonight?
          There's gonna be some pussy there,
          man!

                    DANTE
          With you? I don't think so.

                    JAY
          Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I
          don't hang out with drug dealers."

                                             131.


                    DANTE
          Nothing personal.

     SILENT BOB hands weed to JAY.

                    JAY
          I work, just like you. You're more
          of a crook than I am, dude.

                    DANTE
          How do you figure...HEY! You can't
          roll a joint in here!

                    JAY
               (rolling a joint)
          Relax brother. What I mean is that
          you sell the stuff in this store at
          the highest prices around. A dollar
          seventy-nine for wraps-what's that
          shit?

                    DANTE
          It's not my store.

                    JAY
          And these aren't my drugs-I just
          sell them.

                    DANTE
          The difference is you exploit a
          weakness.

                    JAY
          What's that mean?

                    DANTE
          You sell to people that can't stay
          away from an addiction.

                    JAY
          All right. How much is Pepsi here?

                    DANTE
          A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

                    JAY
          At Food City it's ninety-nine
          cents, plus tax.

                    DANTE
          So.

                                             132.


                    JAY
          So why do you sell it for so much
          more? I'll tell you why-because
          people come here and they're like
          "A dollar eighty for soda? I should
          get it at Food City. But I don't
          feel like driving there. I'll just
          buy it here so I don't have to
          drive up there." That's exploiting
          a weakness, too, isn't it?

                    DANTE
          I can't believe you just rolled a
          joint in here.

                    JAY
          Hey, man, what happened with that
          old guy?

                    DANTE
          He died in the bathroom.

                    JAY
          That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he
          was jerkin' off.

                    DANTE
          I don't know. I wasn't watching.

                    JAY
          Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I
          know I felt like beatin' it when I
          saw her.
               (pantomimes sex)
          Come here, bitch! You like this? Is
          this what you want? Hunhh?

                    DANTE
          Knock it off. That used to be my
          girlfriend.

                    JAY
          You used to go out with her?

                    DANTE
          We were going to start again, I
          think.

                    JAY
          Don't you already have a girlfriend?

                    DANTE
          Veronica.

                                             133.


                    JAY
          Is she that girl who's down here
          all the time? She came here today
          carrying a plate of food.

                    DANTE
          Lasagne.

                    JAY
          And what-you were gonna dump her to
          date that Caitlin chick?

                    DANTE
          Maybe.

                    JAY
          I don't know dude. That Caitlin
          chick's nice. But I see that
          Veronica girl doing shit for you
          all the time. She brings you food,
          she rubs your back...Didn't I see
          her change your tire one day?

                    DANTE
          I jacked the car up. All she did
          was loosen the nuts and put the
          tire on.

                    JAY
          Damn. She sure goes out of her way.

                    DANTE
          She's my girlfriend.

                    JAY
          I've had girlfriends, but all they
          wanted from me was weed and shit.
               (beat)
          Shit, my grandma used to say,
          "Which is better: a good plate with
          nothing on it..." No, wait. I
          fucked up. She said "What's a good-
          looking plate with nothing on it?"

                    DANTE
          Meaning?

                    JAY
          I don't know. She was senile and
          shit. Used to piss herself all the
          time. C'mon Silent Bob.

     Exit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there.

                                             134.


                    SILENT BOB
          You know, there's a million fine-
          looking women in the world, but
          they don't all bring you lasagne at
          work. Most of them just cheat on you.

     SILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the
     bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in
     deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open.

                    DANTE
               (nearly surprised)
          He's right. I love her.

     RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA.

                    RANDAL
          So that's it. He doesn't love you
          anymore. He loves Caitlin.

     VERONICA stares, dumbfounded.

                    VERONICA
          And...he told you all of this?

                    RANDAL
          Pretty much. All except the latent
          homosexuality part-that's just my
          theory.

                    VERONICA
          I...I don't know what to say.

                    RANDAL
          Don't hold it against him. He just
          never got Caitlin out of his system.
          It's not your fault. It's Dante.
               (beat)
          I don't know thing one about chicks.
          Do you want to cry or something? I
          can leave.

                    VERONICA
          I'm not sad.

                    RANDAL
          You're not?

                                             135.


                    VERONICA
          No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed
          off. I feel like he's been killing
          time while he tries to grow the
          balls to tell me how he really
          feels, and then he can't even do it!
          He has his friend do it for him!

                    RANDAL
          He didn't ask me to...

                    VERONICA
          After all that I've done for that
          fuck! And he wants to be with that
          slut? Fine! He can have his slut!

                    RANDAL
          Um, do you think you can give me a
          lift home tonight?

                    VERONICA
               (oblivious of RANDAL)
          I'm going to have a word with that
          asshole.

     VERONICA storms out.

                    RANDAL
          Wait! Veronica...I don't think...

     RANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby.

                    RANDAL
               (to customer)
          What am I worried about? He'll
          probably be glad I started the ball
          rolling. All he ever did was
          complain about her anyway. I'm just
          looking out for his best interests.
          I mean, that's what a friend does,
          am I right? I did him a favor.

                    CUSTOMER
               (sees box on counter)

     above him.

                    DANTE
          What the fuck did you do that for?

                    VERONICA
          If you didn't want to go out with
          me anymore, why didn't you just say
          it? Instead, you pussyfoot around
          and see that slut behind my back!

                    DANTE
          What're you talking about?

                    VERONICA
               (kicks him)
          You've been talking to her on the
          phone for weeks!

                    DANTE
          It was only a few times...

                    VERONICA
          And then you pull that shit this
          morning, freaking out because I've
          gone down on a couple guys!

                    DANTE
          A couple...?

                    VERONICA
               (throws purse at him)
          I'm not the one trying to patch
          things up with my ex, sneaking
          around behind your back! And if you
          think that thirty-seven dicks are a
          lot, then just wait, mister: I'm
          going to put the hookers in Times
          Square to shame with all the guys I
          go down on now!

                    DANTE
          Would you let me explain...

                    VERONICA
          Explain what? How you were waiting
          until the time was right, and then
          you were going to dump me for her?

                    DANTE
               (getting up)
          Veronica...I...it's not like that
          anymore...I mean, it was never
          really like that...

                                             137.


     VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down,
     yelling in pain.

                    VERONICA
          You're damn right it's not like
          that! Because I won't let it be
          like that! You want your slut? Fine!
          The slut is yours!

                    DANTE
          I don't want Caitlin...

                    VERONICA
          You don't know what you want, but
          I'm not going to sit here anymore
          holding your hand until you figure
          it out! I've encouraged you to get
          out of this fucking dump and go
          back to school, to take charge of
          your life and find direction. I
          even transferred so maybe you would
          be more inclined to go back to
          college if I was with you. Everyone
          said it was a stupid move, but I
          didn't care because I loved you and
          wanted to see you pull yourself out
          of this senseless funk you've been
          in since that whore dumped you, oh
          so many years ago. And now you want
          to go back to her so she can fuck
          you over some more?

                    DANTE
          I don't want to go back with her...

                    VERONICA
          Of course not; not now! You're
          caught, and now you're trying to
          snake out of doing what you wanted
          to do. Well, I won't let you. I
          want you to follow through on this,
          just so you can find out what a
          fucking idiot you are. And when she
          dumps you again-and she will,
          Dante, I promise you that-when she
          dumps you again, I want to laugh at
          you, right in your face, just so
          you realize that that was what you
          gave up our relationship for!
               (grabs her purse)
          I'm just glad Randal had the balls
          to tell me, since you couldn't.

          Randal...?

                    VERONICA
          And having him tell me...that was
          just the weakest move ever. You're
          spineless.

                    DANTE
          Veronica, I love you...

                    VERONICA
          Fuck you.

     VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone.

     Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside.

                    RANDAL
          Dante?

     Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.
     DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL
     throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back
     into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
     comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
     Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs
     a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the
     opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at
     his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin
     over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.
     DANTE paws at his eyes. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and
     smacks it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly. DANTE
     chases him out of the frame. M&M's scatter wildly across the
     empty floor, and the ruckus is heard O.C.

                              CUT TO:

     DANTE and RANDAL later, out of breath, on the floor. RANDAL
     sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. DANTE lies
     on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies,
     ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.

                                             139.


                    RANDAL
          How's your eye?

                    DANTE
               (reluctantly)
          The swelling's not so bad. But the
          FDS stings.
               (then)
          How's your neck?

                    RANDAL
          It's hard to swallow.

     They are both silent. Then...

                    RANDAL
          You didn't have to choke me.

                    DANTE
          Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
          that I was going to dump her for
          Caitlin?

                    RANDAL
          I thought I was doing you a favor.

                    DANTE
          Thanks.

                    RANDAL
          You were saying how you couldn't
          initiate change yourself, so I
          figured I'd help you out.

                    DANTE
          Jesus.

     Silence. Then...

                    RANDAL
          You still didn't have to choke me.

                    DANTE
          Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
          kill you.

                    RANDAL
          Why do you say that?

                    DANTE
          Why do I say that? Randal...forget
          it.

                                             140.


                    RANDAL
          No, really. What did I do that was
          so wrong?

                    DANTE
          What don't you do? Randal, sometimes
          it seems like the only reason you
          come to work is to make my life
          miserable.

                    RANDAL
          How do you figure?

                    DANTE
          What time did you get to work today?

                    RANDAL
          Like ten after.

                    DANTE
          You were over half an hour late.
          Then all you do is come over here.

                    RANDAL
          To talk to you.

                    DANTE
          Which means the video store is
          ostensibly closed.

                    RANDAL
          It's not like I'm miles away.

                    DANTE
          Unless you're out renting videos at
          other video stores.

                    RANDAL
          Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
          could watch it together!

                    DANTE
          You get my slapped with a fine, you
          fight with the customers and I have
          to patch everything up. You get us
          chased out of a funeral by violating
          a corpse. To top it all off, you
          ruin my relationship. What's your
          encore? Do you anally rape my
          mother while pouring sugar in my
          gas tank?
                    (MORE)

                                             141.


                    DANTE (CONT'D)
               (sighs)
          You know what the real tragedy is?
          I'm not even supposed to be here
          today!

                    RANDAL
               (suddenly outraged)
          Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
          you trying to pass the buck again.
          I'm the source of all your misery.
          Who closed the store to play hockey?
          Who closed the store to attend a
          wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
          girlfriend without even discussing
          how he felt with his present one?
          You wanna blame somebody, blame
          yourself.
               (beat, as DANTE)
          "I'm not even supposed to be here
          today."
               (whips stuff at DANTE)
          You sound like an asshole. Whose
          choice was it to be here today?
          Nobody twisted your arm. You're
          here today of your own violation,
          my friend. But you'd like to
          believe that the weight of the
          world rests on your shoulders-that
          the store would crumble if Dante
          wasn't here. Well, I got news for
          you, jerk: This store would survive
          without you. Without me either. All
          you do is overcompensate for having
          what's basically a monkey's job:
          You push fucking buttons. Any moron
          can waltz in here and do our jobs,
          but you're obsessed with making it
          seem so much more fucking important,
          so much more epic than it really is.
          You work in a convenience store,
          Dante. And badly, I might add. And
          I work in a shitty video store.
          Badly, as well.
               (beat)
          You know, that guy Jay's got it
          right-he has no delusions about
          what he does. Us? We like to make
          ourselves seem so much better than
          the people that come in here, just
          looking to pick up a paper or-God
          forbid-cigarettes. We look down on
          them, as it we're so advanced.
          Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
          then what are we doing working here?

                                             142.


     RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong
     words alone.

                              CUT TO:

     DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

                              CUT TO:

     DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

                    RANDAL
          I threw out the stuff that got
          broken. The floor looks clean.

                    DANTE
          You need a ride?

                    RANDAL
               (looks out door)
          Got one. Just pulled up.

     They stand in silence. Then...

                    DANTE
          Do you work tomorrow?

                    RANDAL
          Same time. What about you?

                    DANTE
          I'm calling out. Going to hit the
          hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
          try to see Veronica.

                    RANDAL
          You wanna grab something to eat
          tomorrow night...after I get out of
          here?

                    DANTE
          I'll call you. Let you know.

                    RANDAL
          All right. Good luck with Veronica.
          If you want, I can talk to her, you
          know, and explain...

                    DANTE
          No thanks. I'll take care of it.
          We've got a lot of shit to talk
          about.

                                             143.


                    RANDAL
          Helluva day.

                    DANTE
          To say the least.

                    RANDAL
          Do you need a hug or something?
          'Cause I would have no hang-ups
          about hugging you...you know, you
          being a guy and all. Just don't
          knead my ass when you do it.

                    DANTE
          Get the fuck outta here already.

                    RANDAL
          I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

     RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
     the sheet-sign.

                    RANDAL
          You're closed.

     He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

     DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
     and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

     POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

                    DANTE
          What'd you forget something?
               (looks up, surprised)
          Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

     A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
     He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

     JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
     the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
     a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
     change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
     frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

     CREDITS

     Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
     to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
     a clerk, looks down the aisles.

                    CUSTOMER
          Hello? Little help?

                                             144.


     No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
     make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
     counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
