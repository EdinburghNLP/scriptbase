          EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY
                         
          Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two
          feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
          their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
          yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
                         
          A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
          Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
          deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
          fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
          pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
          nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
          hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.
                         
           HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)
           Some of us was in the Second Kansas
           Colored. We fought the rebs at
           Jenkins' Ferry last April, just
           after they'd killed every Negro
           soldier they captured at Poison
           Springs.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARADE GROUNDS ADJACENT TO THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD,
          ANACOSTIA RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Rain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the
          grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending
          assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North
          Carolina.
                         
          Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit:
          HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA
          CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN
          sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is
          at his side.
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided
           warn't taking no reb prisoners.
           And we didn't leave a one of `em
           alive. The ones of us that didn't
           die that day, we joined up with the
           116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp
           Nelson Kentucky.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           What's your name, soldier?
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           Private Harold Green, sir.
           2.
                         
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth
           Massachusetts Cavalry. We're
           waiting over there.
                         
          He nods in the direction of his cavalry.
                         
           IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
           We're leaving our horses behind,
           and shipping out with the 24th
           Infantry for the assault next week
           on Wilmington.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (to Harold Green:)
           How long've you been a soldier?
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           Two year, sir.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Second Kansas Colored Infantry,
           they fought bravely at Jenkins'
           Ferry.
                         
           HAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK
          That's right, sir. They killed a thousand rebel
           soldiers, sir. They were very
           brave.
           (hesitating, then)
           And making three dollars less
           each month than white
           soldiers.
                         
          Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness.
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we
           fight now we -
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           Another three dollars subtracted
           from our pay for our uniforms.
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           That was true, yessir, but that
                          CHANGED -
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           Equal pay now. Still no
           commissioned Negro officers.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.
           3.
                         
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           Yes, sir, that's good you're aware,
           sir. It's only that -
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           (to Lincoln, trying to
           change the subject:)
           You think the Wilmington attack is
           gonna be -
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           Now that white people have
           accustomed themselves to seeing
           Negro men with guns, fighting on
           their behalf, and now that they can
           tolerate Negro soldiers getting the
           same pay - in a few years perhaps
           they can abide the idea of Negro
           lieutenants and captains. In fifty
           years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a
           hundred years - the vote.
                         
          Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           What'll you do after the war,
           Corporal Clark?
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Perhaps I will.
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           But you should know, sir, that I
           get sick at the smell of bootblack
           and I can't cut hair.
                         
          Lincoln smiles.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I've yet to find a man could cut
           mine so it'd make any difference.
                         
                          HAROLD GREEN
           You got springy hair for a white
           man.
                         
          Lincoln laughs.
           4.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Yes, I do. My last barber hanged
           himself. And the one before that.
           Left me his scissors in his will.
                         
          Green laughs.
                         
          TWO WHITE SOLDIERS have come up, two young kids, nervous and
          excited.
                         
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER LINCOLN
          President Lincoln, sir? Evening, boys.
                         
           SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
           Damn! Damn!
           We, we saw you, um. We were at, at -
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
           We was at Gettysburg!
                         
           HAROLD GREEN SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
          You boys fight at Gettysburg? DAMN I can't believe it's -
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
           (to Green, with mild
                          CONTEMPT)
           Naw, we didn't fight there.
           We just signed up last month.
           We saw him two years ago at the
           cemetery dedication.
                         
           SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
           Yeah, we heard you speak! We...
           DAMN DAMN DAMN! Uh, hey, how tall
           are you anyway?!
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
           Jeez, SHUT up!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Could you hear what I said?
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
           No, sir, not much, it was-
                         
           SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
           (he recites, fast and
                          MECHANICALLY:)
           "Four score and seven years ago,
           our fathers brought forth on this
           continent a new nation, conceived
           in liberty and dedicated to the
           5.
                         
                         
           proposition that all men are
           created equal."
                         
                          LINCOLN
           That's good, thank you for -
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
           "Now we are engaged in a great
           civil war, testing whether that
           nation or any nation so conceived
           and so dedicated can long endure.
           We are, we are, we are met on a
           great battlefield of that war."
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Thank you, that's -
                         
           SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
           "We have come to dedicate a portion
           of that field as a final resting
           place for those who here gave their
           lives that that nation might live.
           It is..."
           (He chokes up a little.)
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
           His uncles, they died on the second
           day of fighting.
                         
                         
           SECOND WHITE SOLDIER A VOICE (O.C.)
          I know the last part. "It is, Company up! Move it out!
          uh, it is rather -"
                         
          Soldiers all over the field rise up at the mustering of the
          troops. Names of regiments, brigades, divisions are called:
          all across the field, the men put out fires, put on
          knapsacks.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (to the two white
                          SOLDIERS:)
           You fellas best find your company.
                         
           FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
                          (SALUTING LINCOLN:)
           Thank you, sir. God bless you!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           God bless you.
                         
          The second white soldier salutes, and the two move out.
           6.
                         
                         
          Green salutes Lincoln as well and glances at Clark, who
          remains, looking down. Green leaves. Clark looks up, salutes
          Lincoln and, turning smartly, walks toward his unit.
                         
          Then he stops, turns back, faces Lincoln, who watches him. A
          beat, and then, in a tone of admiration and cautious
          admonishment, reminding Lincoln of his promise:
                         
                          IRA CLARK
           "That we here highly resolve that
           these dead shall not have died in
                          VAIN -- "
                         
          Clark salutes Lincoln again, turns again and walks away.
          Lincoln watches him go. As he walks into the fog, Clark
          continues reciting in a powerful voice:
                         
           IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
           " - That this nation, under God,
           shall have a new birth of freedom --
           and that government of the people,
           by the people, for the people,
           shall not perish from the earth."
                         
          Lincoln watches Clark until the fog's swallowed him up.
                         
                         TITLE:
                         
           JANUARY, 1865
                         
           TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S RE-ELECTION
                         
           THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR
                         
                         
          EXT. A SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT
                         
          A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part
          iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing
          through the choppy black waters of an open sea.
                         
          Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no
          railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough
          water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck
          is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret.
                         
           LINCOLN (V.O.)
           It's nighttime. The ship's moved
           by some terrible power, at a
           terrific speed.
                         
          Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon,
          indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears
          to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship.
           7.
                         
                         
           LINCOLN (V.O.)
           Though it's imperceptible in the
           darkness, I have an intuition that
           we're headed towards a shore. No
           one else seems to be aboard the
           vessel. I'm alone.
                         
                         
          INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's
          workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases:
          clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere.
                         
          Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy
          frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie
          unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with
          documents on his lap.
                         
          MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and
          night cap. She watches him in her vanity mirror.
                         
          She looks frightened.
                         
          TITLE: THE WHITE HOUSE
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I could be bounded in a nutshell
           and count myself a king of infinite
           space...were it not that I have bad
           dreams.
           I reckon it's the speed that's
           strange to me. I'm used to going a
           deliberate pace.
                         
          Mary looks at him, stricken with alarm.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I should spare you. I shouldn't
           tell you my dreams.
                         
                          MARY
           I don't want to be spared if you
           aren't! And you spare me nothing.
                         
          He looks down at the carpet, then back up at her.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on
           Wilmington port. You dream about
           the ship before a battle, usually.

                          LINCOLN
           (rapping lightly on his
                          FOREHEAD:)
           How's the coconut?
                         
                          MARY
           Beyond description.
                         
          She delicately touches her head.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           Almost two years, nothing mends.
           Another casualty of the war. Who
           wants to listen to a useless woman
           grouse about her carriage accident?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I do.
                         
                          MARY
           Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's
           all, I'm your soothsayer, that's
           all I am anymore, I'm not to be
           trusted with - Even if it wasn't a
           carriage accident, even if it was
           an attempted assassination -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It was most probably an -
                         
                          MARY
           It was an assassin. Whose intended
           target was you.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           How's the plans for the big shindy
           progressing?
                         
                          MARY
           I don't want to talk about parties!
           You don't care about parties.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Not much but they're a necessary -
                         
          Mary studies Lincoln, thinking. Then a revelation:
                         
                          MARY
           I know...I know what it's about.
           The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port,
           it's not a military campaign! It's
           the amendment to abolish slavery!
           Why else would you force me to
           9.
                         
                         
           invite demented radicals into my
           home?
                         
          Lincoln closes his folio.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           You're going to try to get the
           amendment passed in the House of
           Representatives, before the term
           ends, before the Inauguration.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (STANDING:)
           Don't spend too much money on the
           flubdubs.
                         
          Mary stands, goes up to him.
                         
                          MARY
           No one's loved as much as you, no
           one's ever been loved so much, by
           the people, you might do anything
           now. Don't, don't waste that power
           on an amendment bill that's sure of
           defeat.
                         
          Seeing that he's not going to discuss this, she turns away,
          walking to an open window.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           Did you remember Robert's coming
           home for the reception?
                         
          Lincoln nods, though Mary isn't bothering to look at him.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           I knew you'd forget.
                         
          She closes the window.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           That's the ship you're sailing on.
           The Thirteenth Amendment. You
           needn't tell me I'm right. I know I
           am.
                         
          She watches as he leaves the room, smiling in bitter victory:
          she's right.
           10.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, LEAVING MARY'S BOUDOIR - NIGHT
                         
          Lincoln encounters ELIZABETH KECKLEY, a light-skinned black
          woman, 38, Mary's dressmaker and close friend, holding a dark-
          blue velvet bodice embroidered with jet beads.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It's late, Mrs. Keckley.
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           (holding out the bodice:)
           She needs this for the grand
           reception.
                         
          Lincoln bends down to look at the intricate beading.
                         
           ELIZABETH KECKLEY (CONT'D)
           It's slow work.
                         
          He nods, smiles, straightens up.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Good night.
                         
          He continues down the hall. Mrs. Keckley starts to enter
          Mary's boudoir, then stops, sensing something amiss. She
          calls quietly after Lincoln:
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           (concerned, a little
                          EXASPERATED:)
           Did you tell her a dream?
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, SECOND FLOOR, WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A working room, sparsely furnished. Lincoln's desk is heaped
          with files, books, newspapers. The desk's near a window, now
          open. Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner. Near
          the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long
          table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of
          inkwells and pens.
                         
          Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases.
                         
          Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son
          TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very
          large military map. Lead toy soldiers are scattered across
          it.
                         
          A large mahogany box, imprinted ALEXANDER GARDNER STUDIOS,
          is open near Tad's head. The box contains large glass plates,
          each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives. Tad's
          been looking at several, which lie near him on the map.
           11.
                         
                         
          Lincoln kneels by Tad and looks down at the map, a
          topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land
          between Union and Confederate forces at Petersburg. He
          scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.
                         
          He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the
          firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young
          black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:
          "Abner, age 12 - $500"
                         
          And another: "Two young boys, 10 & 14 - $700"
                         
          Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid.
          Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down
          beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.
          Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking
          up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.
          Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little
          surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he
          was the night before.
                         
                          TAD
                          (FAST ASLEEP:)
           Papa...
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Hmm?
                         
                          TAD
           Papa I wanna see Willie.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (WHISPERING:)
           Me too, Taddie. But we can't.
                         
                          TAD
           Why not?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Willie's gone. Three years now.
           He's gone.
                         
          Lincoln carries Tad out of the room, closing the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTSIDE THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON - MORNING
                         
          A new flagpole is being dedicated. Lincoln, in a black
          overcoat and his stovepipe hat, and Treasury Secretary
          WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59, stand by the pole. They face an
          audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers.
          A Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of "We
          Are Coming Father Abra'am."
           12.
                         
                         
          Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards. Lincoln moves
          into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper
          from inside his hat and glances at it. Then he looks up.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           The part assigned to me is to raise
           the flag, which, if there be no
           fault in the machinery, I will do,
           and when up, it will be for the
           people to keep it up.
                         
          He puts the paper away. The audience waits, expecting more.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           That's my speech.
                         
          He smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln
          turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We
          Are Coming Father Abra'am" and the audience joins in. Among
          them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick,
          exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant
          secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased.
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           "We are coming, Father Abra'am,
           three hundred thousand more,
           From Mississippi's winding stream
           and from New England's shore..."
           We leave our plows and workshops,
           our wives and children dear,
           With hearts too full for utterance,
           With but a silent tear.
           We're coming Father Abra'am..."
                         
                         
          EXT. A CARRIAGE, PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON - MORNING
                         
          In a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite
          Lincoln. Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio
          on his lap.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Even if every Republican in the
           House votes yes - far from
           guaranteed, since when has our
           party unanimously supported
           anything? - but say all our fellow
           Republicans vote for it. We'd still
           be twenty votes short.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Only twenty.
           13.
                         
                         
                          SEWARD
           Only twenty!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We can find twenty votes.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Twenty House Democrats who'll vote
           to abolish slavery! In my opinion -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           To which I always listen.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Or pretend to.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           With all three of my ears.
                         
                          SEWARD
           We'll win the war soon - It's
           inevitable, isn't it?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Ain't won yit.
                         
                          SEWARD
           You'll begin your second term with
           semi-divine stature. Imagine the
           possibilities peace will bring!
           Why tarnish your invaluable luster
           with a battle in the House? It's a
           rats' nest in there, the same gang
           of talentless hicks and hacks that
           rejected the amendment ten months
           back. We'll lose.
                         
          Lincoln smiles.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I like our chances now.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Lincoln is at his desk, Hay feeding him documents to read and
          sign. Seward warms himself by the fireplace, holding a
          brandy.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Consider the obstacles that we'd
           face. The aforementioned two-thirds
           majority needed to pass an
           amendment: we have a Republican
           14.
                         
                         
           majority, but barely more than
           fifty percent -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Fifty-six.
                         
                          SEWARD
           We need Democratic support. There's
           none to be had.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Since the House last voted on the
           amendment there's been an election.
           Sixty-four Democrats lost their
           House seats in November. That's
           sixty-four Democrats looking for
           work come March.
                         
                          SEWARD LINCOLN
          I know, but that's - They don't need to worry
           about re-election, they can
           vote however it suits `em.
                         
          There's a knock at the office door.
                         
                         
                          SEWARD LINCOLN
          But we can't, um, buy the (to Hay:)
          vote for the amendment. It's Might as well let `em in.
          too important.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I said nothing of buying anything.
           We need twenty votes was all I
           said. Start of my second term,
           plenty of positions to fill.
                         
          Hay opens the door to the outer office, admitting the sound
          of a sizable crowd. JOHN NICOLAY, 33, Lincoln's rather severe
          German-born senior secretary, ushers in MR. JOLLY, mid-40s,
          mud-spattered coat, hat in hands, followed by MRS. JOLLY,
          similarly road-worn, holding a suitcase. Lincoln stands.
                         
                          JOHN NICOLAY
           Mr. President, may I present Mr.
           and Mrs. Jolly who've come from
           Missouri to -
                         
           MR. JOLLY
           From Jeff City, President.
                         
          Lincoln shakes Mr. Jolly's hand. Mrs. Jolly curtseys.
           15.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the
           fire's Secretary of State Seward.
                         
          Seward nods slightly as he lights a Cuban cigar.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Jeff City.
                         
          Lincoln looks at the Jollys. They are worried and a little
          awed.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I heard tell once of a Jefferson
           City lawyer who had a parrot that'd
           wake him each morning crying out,
           "Today is the day the world shall
           end, as scripture has foretold."
           And one day the lawyer shot him for
           the sake of peace and quiet, I
           presume, thus fulfilling, for the
           bird at least, its prophecy!
                         
          Lincoln smiles. The Jollys don't get it. Mr. Jolly looks back
          at Seward, who gestures for him to speak, then exhales a
          plume of smoke.
                         
           MR. JOLLY
           (launching into his
                          PREPARED SPEECH:)
           They's only one tollbooth in Jeff
           City, t' the southwest `n this man
           Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla been in
           illegal possession for near two
           yar, since your man General
           Schofield set him up there. But
           President Monroe give that tollgate
           to my granpap and Quincy Adams give
           my pap a letter saying it's our'n
           for keeps. Mrs. Jolly got the -
           (to his wife:)
           Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams
           letter.
                         
          Mrs. Jolly opens the suitcase and begins to dig frantically
          for the letter.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.
           Just tell me what you want from
           me.
                         
          Seward exhales more smoke.
           16.
                         
                         
          Mr. Jolly starts coughing, while Mrs. Jolly tries to fan away
          the cigar smoke with the Quincy Adams letter.
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           Mr. Jolly's emphysema don't care
           for cigars.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Madame. Do you know about the
           proposed Thirteenth Amendment to
           the Constitution -
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           Yes sir, everybody knows of it. The
           President favors it.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Do you?
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           We do.
                         
                          SEWARD
           You know that it abolishes slavery?
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           Yes sir. I know it.
                         
                          SEWARD
           And is that why you favor it?
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           What I favor's ending the war.
           Once't we do away with slavery, the
           rebs'll quit fighting, since
           slavery's what they're fighting
           for. Mr. Lincoln, you always says
           so. With the amendment, slavery's
           ended and they'll give up. The war
           can finish then.
                         
                          SEWARD
           If the war finished first, before
           we end slavery, would -
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           President Lincoln says the war
           won't stop unless we finish slavery-
                         
                          SEWARD
           But if it did. The South is
           exhausted. If they run out of
           bullets and men, would you still
           17.
                         
                         
           want your, uh - Who's your
           representative?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Jeff City? That's, uh, Congressman
           Burton?
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           "Beanpole" Burton, I mean, Josiah
           Burton, yes, sir!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (to Mrs. Jolly:)
           Republican. Undecided on the
           question of the amendment, I
           believe. Perhaps you could call on
           him and inform him of your
           enthusiasm.
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           Yeah...
                         
                          SEWARD
           Madam? If the rebels surrender next
           week, would you, at the end of this
           month, want Congressman Burton to
           vote for the Thirteenth Amendment?
                         
          Mrs. Jolly is puzzled, and looks to Mr. Jolly. Then:
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           If that was how it was, no more war
           and all, I reckon Mr. Jolly'd much
           prefer not to have Congress pass
           the amendment.
                         
          Mr. Jolly nods. Seward glances at Lincoln, then turns back to
                         THE JOLLYS:
                         
                          SEWARD
           And why's that?
                         
          Mr. Jolly's surprised: the answer's so obvious.
                         
           MR. JOLLY
           (in a hoarse voice:)
           Niggers.
                         
           MRS. JOLLY
           If he don't have to let some
           Alabama coon come up to Missouri,
           steal his chickens, and his job,
           he'd much prefer that.
           18.
                         
                         
          Seward takes the letter from Mrs. Jolly and hands it to
          Lincoln.
                         
                          SEWARD
           (to Lincoln, quietly:)
           The people!
           I begin to see why you're in such a
           great hurry to put it through.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (to Mr. Jolly:)
           Would you let me study this letter,
           sir, about the tollbooth? Come back
           to me in the morning and we'll
           consider what the law says.
                         
          Lincoln stands.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           And be sure to visit "Beanpole" and
           tell him that you support passage
           of the Amendment. As a military
           necessity.
                         
          The Jollys nod, skeptical now.
                         
                          NICOLAY
           (to the Jollys:)
           Thank you.
                         
          Nicolay escorts them out. Before he closes the door:
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Oh, Nicolay? When you have a
           moment.
                         
          Nicolay nods and steps into the anteroom, where dozens more
          petitioners are waiting to speak with Lincoln. Hay confers
          with the doorman. Seward closes the door behind them.
                         
          Lincoln kneels at the fireplace, stoking the fire. He puts
          more wood in, then stands. Seward watches him, then:
                         
                          SEWARD
           If procuring votes with offers of
           employment is what you intend, I'll
           fetch a friend from Albany who can
           supply the skulking men gifted at
           this kind of shady work. Spare me
           the indignity of actually speaking
           to Democrats. Spare you the
           exposure and liability.
           19.
                         
                         
          There is a sharp knock on the closed door, followed by two
          long ones.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Pardon me, that's a distress
           signal, which I am bound by solemn
           oath to respond to.
                         
          Lincoln opens the door. Tad enters, cross.
                         
                          TAD
           Tom Pendel took away the glass
           camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardner
           sent over because Tom says mama
           says they're too distressing, but-
                         
                          LINCOLN
           You had nightmares all night,
           mama's right to -
                         
                          TAD
           But I'll have worse nightmares if
           you don't let me look at the plates
           again!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Perhaps.
                         
                          SEWARD
           We can't afford a single defection
           from anyone in our party...not even
           a single Republican absent when
           they vote. You know who you've got
           to see.
                         
          Nicolay enters. Lincoln turns to him.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Send over to Blair House. Ask
           Preston Blair can I call on him
           around five o'clock.

                          BRANDY:)

          INT. THE LIBRARY, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON - EVENING
                         
          Lincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman.
           20.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           If the Blairs tell `em to, no
           Republican will balk at voting for
           the amendment.
                         
          The room is baronial. PRESTON BLAIR, patriarch of his wealthy
          and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son,
          MONTGOMERY BLAIR, 50, whip-thin. A fire blazes in a massive
          fireplace behind Monty. Preston's handsome, elegant daughter,
          ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE, 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad,
          who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by
          his side.

           No conservative Republican is what
           you mean -
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           All Republicans ought to be
           conservative, I founded this party -
           in my own goddamned home - to be a
           conservative antislavery party, not
           a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical
           abolitionists and -
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy,
           you'll frighten the child.
                         
                          MONTGOMERY BLAIR
                          (TO LINCOLN:)
           You need us to keep the
           conservative side of the party in
           the traces while you diddle the
           radicals and bundle up with
           Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need
           our help.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Yes, sir, I do.
                         
                          MONTGOMERY BLAIR
           Well, what do we get?
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Whoo! Blunt! Your manners, Monty,
           must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you
           out of his cabinet.
                         
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR
          He was pushed out - I wasn't pushed.
           21.
                         
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
                          (SMILING SARCASTICALLY:)
           Oh of course you weren't.
                         
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR
          He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:)
          the goddamn radical I agreed to resign.
          abolishonists!
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
           (a nod at Tad:)
           Oh Daddy, please!
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           You don't mind, boy, do you?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           He spends his days with soldiers.
                         
                          TAD
           They taught me a song!
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Did they? Soldiers know all manner
           of songs. How's your brother Bob?
                         
                          TAD
           He's at school now, but he's coming
           to visit in four days! For the
           shindy!
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           At school! Ain't that fine! Good
           he's not in the army!
                         
                          TAD
           Oh he wants to be, but mama said he
                          CAN'T -
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Dangerous life, soldiering.
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Your mama is wise to keep him clean
           out of that.
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Now your daddy knows that what I
           want, in return for all the help I
           give him, is to go down to Richmond
           like he said I could, soon as
           Savannah fell, and talk to
           Jefferson Davis. Give me terms I
           22.
                         
                         
           can offer to Jefferson Davis to
           start negotiating for peace. He'll
           talk to me!
                         
                          MONTGOMERY BLAIR
           Conservative members of your party
           want you to listen to overtures
           from Richmond. That above all.
                         
          Two black servants who have entered begin to pour and serve
          tea.
                         
           MONTGOMERY BLAIR (CONT'D)
           They'll vote for this rash and
           dangerous amendment only if every
           other possibility is exhausted.
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Our Republicans ain't
           abolitionists. We can't tell our
           people they can vote yes on
           abolishing slavery unless at the
           same time we can tell `em that
           you're seeking a negotiated peace.
                         
          The Blairs look at Lincoln, waiting for an answer.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTSIDE BLAIR HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A light snow's beginning to fall. A lacquered coach stands
          outside the house, the Blair crest in gold on its doors.
                         
          Elizabeth Blair Lee, a blanket in her arms, comes out of the
          house, talking to LEO, an elderly black servant, formerly a
          slave belonging to the Blairs. They're followed by an elderly
          black woman in a housekeeper's uniform.
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Leo, it's a hundred miles to
           Richmond. Get him drunk so he can
           sleep.
                         
                          LEO
           Yes'm.
                         
          Elizabeth goes to the carriage, where Preston awaits. She
          passes the blanket through the carriage window and tucks it
          around her father.
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Here, daddy.
           23.
                         
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
          Oh! Thank you. (fussing with the
                          BLANKET:)
           Let's fix this up...
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Where's my hat?
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
           Leo has your hat. All right?
                         
          As Leo climbs into the carriage, Elizabeth kisses her hand,
          then slaps the kiss on her father's cheek.
                         
           ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
           Go make peace.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          The cabinet has assembled. Lincoln heads the table, Seward at
          his left and EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War, 51, barrel-
          shaped, long bearded, bespectacled, at his right. Next to him
          are Secretary of the Navy GIDEON WELLES, 63, luxurious white
          hair (it's a wig) and a flowing snowy beard; Postmaster
          General WILLIAM DENNISON, 50; Secretary of the Interior JOHN
          USHER, 49; Secretary of the Treasury WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59;
          and Attorney General JAMES SPEED, 53.
                         
          Nicolay and Hay are in chairs behind Lincoln, taking notes.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (TO STANTON:)
           Thunder forth, God of War!
                         
          Stanton clears his throat. He's noticed the singed edge.
                         
                          STANTON
           We'll commence our assault on
           Wilmington from the sea.
                          (PEEVED:)
           Why is this burnt? Was the boy
           playing with it?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It got took by a breeze several
           nights back.
                         
                          STANTON
           This is an official War Department
           map!
           24.
                         
                         
                          SEWARD
           And the entire cabinet's waiting to
           hear what it portends.
                         
                          WELLES
           A bombardment. From the largest
           fleet the Navy has ever assembled.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (TO WELLES:)
           Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks!
                         
          Welles stands.
                         
                          WELLES
           Fifty-eight ships are underway, of
           every tonnage and firing range.
                         
          Welles gestures on the map to the positions of many ships.
                         
                          STANTON
           We'll keep up a steady barrage. Our
           first target is Fort Fisher. It
           defends Wilmington Port.
                         
          Stanton indicates the lines tracing artillery trajectories.
          These converge particularly heavily on Fort Fisher.
                         
                          JAMES SPEED
           A steady barrage?
                         
                          STANTON
           A hundred shells a minute.
                         
          There's a moment of shocked silence.
                         
                          STANTON (CONT'D)
           Till they surrender.
                         
                          WILLIAM FESSENDEN
           Dear God.
                         
                          WELLES
           Yes. Yes.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Wilmington's their last open
           seaport. Therefore...
                         
                          STANTON
           Wilmington falls, Richmond falls
           after.
           25.
                         
                         
                          SEWARD
           And the war... is done.
                         
          The rest of the cabinet applauds, foot stomping, table
          slapping. Only John Usher doesn't join in.
                         
                          JOHN USHER
           Then why, if I may ask are we not
           concentrating the nation's
           attention on Wilmington? Why,
           instead, are we reading in the
                          HERALD -
           (he smacks a newspaper on
                          THE TABLE)
           - that the anti-slavery amendment
           is being precipitated onto the
           House floor for debate - because
           your eagerness, in what seems an
           unwarranted intrusion of the
           Executive into Legislative
           prerogatives, is compelling it to
           it's... to what's likely to be its
           premature demise? You signed the
           Emancipation Proclamation, you've
           done all that can be expected -
                         
                          JAMES SPEED
           The Emancipation Proclamation's
           merely a war measure. After the war
           the courts'll make a meal of it.
                         
                          JOHN USHER
           When Edward Bates was Attorney
           General, he felt confident in it
           enough to allow you to sign -
                         
                          JAMES SPEED
                          (A SHRUG:)
           Different lawyers, different
           opinions. It frees slaves as a
           military exigent, not in any other -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I don't recall Bates being any too
           certain about the legality of my
           Proclamation, just it wasn't
           downright criminal. Somewhere's in
           between. Back when I rode the legal
           circuit in Illinois I defended a
           woman from Metamora named Melissa
           Goings, 77 years old, they said she
           murdered her husband; he was 83. He
           was choking her; and, uh, she
           grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
           26.
                         
                         
           wood and fractured his skull, `n he
           died. In his will he wrote "I
           expect she has killed me. If I get
           over it, I will have revenge."
                         
          This gets a laugh.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           No one was keen to see her
           convicted, he was that kind of
           husband. I asked the prosecuting
           attorney if I might have a short
           conference with my client. And she
           and I went into a room in the
           courthouse, but I alone emerged.
           The window in the room was found to
           be wide open. It was believed the
           old lady may have climbed out of
           it. I told the bailiff right before
           I left her in the room she asked me
           where she could get a good drink of
           water, and I told her Tennessee.
           Mrs. Goings was seen no more in
           Metamora. Enough justice had been
           done; they even forgave the
           bondsman her bail.
                         
                          JOHN USHER
           I'm afraid I don't -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I decided that the Constitution
           gives me war powers, but no one
           knows just exactly what those
           powers are. Some say they don't
           exist. I don't know. I decided I
           needed them to exist to uphold my
           oath to protect the Constitution,
           which I decided meant that I could
           take the rebels' slaves from `em as
           property confiscated in war. That
           might recommend to suspicion that I
           agree with the rebs that their
           slaves are property in the first
           place. Of course I don't, never
           have, I'm glad to see any man free,
           and if calling a man property, or
           war contraband, does the trick...
           Why I caught at the opportunity.
           Now here's where it gets truly
           slippery. I use the law allowing
           for the seizure of property in a
           war knowing it applies only to the
           property of governments and
           27.
                         
                         
           citizens of belligerent nations.
           But the South ain't a nation,
           that's why I can't negotiate with
           'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
           property according to law, have I
           the right to take the rebels'
           property from `em, if I insist
           they're rebels only, and not
           citizens of a belligerent country?
           And slipperier still: I maintain it
           ain't our actual Southern states in
           rebellion, but only the rebels
           living in those states, the laws of
           which states remain in force. The
           laws of which states remain in
           force. That means, that since it's
           states' laws that determine whether
           Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
           property - the Federal government
           doesn't have a say in that, least
           not yet -
           (a glance at Seward,
                          THEN:)
           - then Negroes in those states are
           slaves, hence property, hence my
           war powers allow me to confiscate
           `em as such. So I confiscated `em.
           But if I'm a respecter of states'
           laws, how then can I legally free
           `em with my Proclamation, as I
           done, unless I'm cancelling states'
           laws? I felt the war demanded it;
           my oath demanded it; I felt right
           with myself; and I hoped it was
           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.
                         
          He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Two years ago I proclaimed these
           people emancipated - "then,
           thenceforward and forever free."
           But let's say the courts decide I
           had no authority to do it. They
           might well decide that. Say there's
           no amendment abolishing slavery.
           Say it's after the war, and I can
           no longer use my war powers to just
           ignore the courts' decisions, like
           I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
           those people I freed be ordered
           back into slavery? That's why I'd
           like to get the Thirteenth
           Amendment through the House, and on
           28.
                         
                         
           its way to ratification by the
           states, wrap the whole slavery
           thing up, forever and aye. As soon
           as I'm able. Now. End of this
           month. And I'd like you to stand
           behind me. Like my cabinet's most
           always done.
                         
          A moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           As the preacher said, I could write
           shorter sermons but once I start I
           get too lazy to stop.
                         
                          JOHN USHER
           It seems to me, sir, you're
           describing precisely the sort of
           dictator the Democrats have been
           howling about.
                         
                          JAMES SPEED
           Dictators aren't susceptible to
           law.
                         
                          JOHN USHER
           Neither is he! He just said as
           much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting
           meanings? What reins him in from,
           from...
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Well, the people do that, I
           suppose. I signed the Emancipation
           Proclamation a year and half before
           my second election. I felt I was
           within my power to do it; however I
           also felt that I might be wrong
           about that; I knew the people would
           tell me. I gave `em a year and half
           to think about it. And they re-
           elected me.
                          (BEAT)
           And come February the first, I
           intend to sign the Thirteenth
           Amendment.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON
                         
          Nicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit
          perpetually worried JAMES ASHLEY, 42, (R, OH). Tad eyes him
          from a chair by the window.
           29.
                         
                         
          Lincoln enters the room with Seward.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!
           Tell us the news from the Hill.
                         
          Lincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated
          but flattered representative on the shoulder.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Well! Ah! News -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Why for instance is this thus, and
           what is the reason for this
           thusness?
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           I...
                         
                          SEWARD
           James, we want you to bring the
           anti-slavery amendment to the floor
           for debate -
                         
           JAMES ASHLEY SEWARD
          Excuse me. What? - immediately, and - You are
           the amendment's manager, are
           you not?
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           I am, of course - But -
           Immediately?
                         
                          SEWARD
           And we're counting on robust
           radical support, so tell Mr.
           Stevens we expect him to put his
           back into it, it's not going to be
           easy, but we trust -
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           It's impossible. No, I am sorry,
           no, we can't organize anything
           immediately in the House. I have
           been canvassing the Democrats since
           the election, in case any of them
           softened after they got walloped.
           But they have stiffened if
           anything, Mr. Secretary. There
           aren't nearly enough votes -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!
           30.
                         
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Whalers? As in, um, whales?
                         
          Lincoln moves in, standing very close to Ashley.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We've been chasing this whale for a
           long time. We've finally placed a
           harpoon in the monster's back.
           It's in, James, it's in! We finish
           the deed now, we can't wait! Or
           with one flop of his tail he'll
           smash the boat and send us all to
           eternity!
                         
                          SEWARD
           On the 31st of this month. Of this
           year. Put the amendment up for a
           vote.
                         
          Ashley is agog.
                         
                         
          INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL - EVENING
                         
          The room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of
          Robespierre, a print of Tom Paine), long occupancy and hard
          work. On the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded
          banner: "RE-ELECT THADDEUS STEVENS, REPUBLICAN TICKET, 9TH
          CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, LANCASTER PENNSYLVANIA". At the desk
          sits THADDEUS STEVENS (R, PA), 73, bald under a horrible red
          wig, a gaunt, powerful face resembling Lincoln's, though
          beardless and bitter.
                         
          In the office are Ashley, Speaker of the House SCHUYLER
          COLFAX (R, IN), formidable Senator BLUFF WADE (R, MA), who's
          never smiled, and ASA VINTNER LITTON (R, MD).
                         
                          BLUFF WADE
           Whalers?
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           That's what he said.
                         
                          BLUFF WADE
           The man's never been near a whale
           ship in his life!
                          (TO STEVENS:)
           Withdraw radical support, force him
           to abandon this scheme, whatever
           he's up to - He drags his feet
           about everything, Lincoln; why this
           urgency? We got it through the
           Senate without difficulty because
           31.
                         
                         
           we had the numbers. Come December
           you'll have the same in the House.
           The amendment'll be the easy work
           of ten minutes.
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           He's using the threat of the
           amendment to frighten the rebels
           into an immediate surrender.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           Will you rejoice when the Southern
           states have re-joined the Union,
           pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them
           to, and one by one each refuses to
           ratify the amendment? If we pass
           it, which we won't.
                          (TO STEVENS:)
           Why are we co-operating with, with
           him? We all know what he's doing
           and we all know what he'll do. We
           can't offer up abolition's best
           legal prayer to his games and
           tricks.
                         
                          BLUFF WADE
           He's said he'd welcome the South
           back with all its slaves in chains.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Three years ago he said that! To
           calm the border states when we were-
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           I don't.
                         
          This confuses the room. Stevens turns to Vintner Litton.
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           You said "we all know what he'll
           do." I don't know.
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           You know he isn't to be trusted.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Trust? I'm sorry, I was under the
           misapprehension your chosen
           profession was politics. I've never
           trusted the President. I never
           32.
                         
                         
           trust anyone. But... Hasn't he
           surprised you?
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Nothing surprises you, Asa,
           therefore nothing about you is
           surprising. Perhaps that is why
           your constituents did not re-elect
           you to the coming term.
           (collecting his cane and
                          STANDING:)
           It's late, I'm old, I'm going home.
                         
          Stevens limps to the door, opens it, and turns.
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           Lincoln the inveterate dawdler,
           Lincoln the Southerner, Lincoln the
           capitulating compromiser, our
           adversary - and leader of the
           godforsaken Republican Party, our
           party - Abraham Lincoln has asked
           us to work with him to accomplish
           the death of slavery in America.
                          (BEAT:)
           Retain, even in opposition, your
           capacity for astonishment.
                         
          Stevens leaves, shutting the door. They watch him go, Ashley
          excited, Litton unmoved, insulted, skeptical.
                         
                         
          INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM, OLD TAVERN IN WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT
                         
          In a cramped private alcove, a low, sagging timber ceiling,
          sooty walls, sawdusted floor, ancient curtain closing it off,
          Seward sits at a small table with ROBERT LATHAM, an Albany NY
          political operative, RICHARD SCHELL, a Wall Street
          speculator, and W.N. BILBO, a Tennessee lawyer and lobbyist.
          A chandelier with candles drips wax on them.
                         
          On the table, a leather folio lies open: prospectuses for
          jobs in the administration. Latham and Schell study these.
          Bilbo is studying Seward.
                         
                          SEWARD
           The President is never to be
           mentioned. Nor I. You're paid for
           your discretion.
           33.
                         
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Hell, you can have that for
           nothin', what we need money for is
           bribes. It'd speed things up.
                         
                          SEWARD
           No. Nothing strictly illegal.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           It's not illegal to bribe
           Congressmen. They starve
           otherwise.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and
           Mr. Latham that we're offering
           patronage jobs to the Dems who vote
           yes. Jobs and nothing more.
                         
                          SEWARD
           That's correct.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Congressmen come cheap! Few
           thousand bucks'll buy you all you
           need.
                         
                          SEWARD
           The President would be unhappy to
           hear you did that.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Well, will he be unhappy if we
           lose?
                         
          A WAITRESS brings in a platter of roasted crabs, which she
          slams down on the table, and leaves.

           The money I managed to raise for
           this endeavor is only for your
           fees, food, and lodgings.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Uh huh. If that squirrel-infested
           attic you've quartered us in's any
           measure, you ain't raised much.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Shall we get to work?
                         
          Bilbo takes a mallet to a crab, smashing it!

          INT. FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY
                         
          A gavel slams down on a sounding block in an attempt to
          silence the raucous tumult in the large chamber. It subsides
          enough for Colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central
                         DAIS:
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           The House recognizes Fernando Wood,
           the honorable representative from
           New York.
                         
          TITLE: THE HOUSE DEBATE BEGINS
                         
                          JANUARY 9
                         
          Floor and balcony are full, although the desks of
          representatives from seceded states are bare and unoccupied.
                         
          On the Democratic side, 81 members applaud FERNANDO WOOD (D,
          NY) as he takes the podium. The Democratic leadership,
          including GEORGE YEAMAN (KY), has gathered around House
          minority leader GEORGE PENDLETON(OH). On the Republican side
          of the aisle, enraged booing from the 102 Republicans,
          including HIRAM PRICE (IA), GEORGE JULIAN (IN), Vintner
          Litton and Ashley, all gathered around Stevens's desk.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Estimable colleagues. Two bloody
           years ago this month, his Highness,
           King Abraham Africanus the First -
           our Great Usurping Caesar, violator
           of habeas corpus and freedom of the
           press, abuser of states' rights -
                         
           HIRAM PRICE FERNANDO WOOD
           (loud:) - radical republican autocrat
          If Lincoln really were a ruling by fiat and martial
          tyrant, Mr. Wood, he'd'a had law affixed his name to his
          your empty head impaled on a heinous and illicit
          pike, and the country better Emancipation Proclamation,
          for it! promising it would hasten the
           end of the war, which yet
           rages on and on.
                         
          Murmuring from the floor and the balcony, in the front row of
          which Mary and Elizabeth Keckley sit. Mary turns her gaze
          from the floor to watch Latham and Schell, a few seats away,
          scrutinize the floor, whispering, Latham taking notes. Schell
          holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap. Bilbo sits
          behind them.
                         
          They study the other NY Democrats - CHARLES HANSON, NELSON

          comprise a cluster of glum uncomfortable passivity on that
          side of the aisle.

          Wood points at Stevens, granite-faced. Stevens's eyes burn
          back at Wood.
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
           - and radical Republicanism's
           abolitionist fanaticism!
                         
          This prompts shouts and boos from the Republicans.
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
           His Emancipation Proclamation has
           obliterated millions of dollars'
           worth of personal property rights -
                         
          Schell examines the Pennsylvania Democrats: an openly
          appalled ARCHIBALD MORAN, AMBROSE BAILER, and, chewing his
          thumb, a painful fake grin pinned to his face, ALEXANDER
          COFFROTH. Schell leans in to Latham.
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) RICHARD SCHELL

          Cheering and booing.
                         
          In the Connecticut delegation, JOHN ELLIS winds his pocket
          watch, looking contemptuously at Wood. Schell makes a note.
           36.
                         
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) W.N. BILBO

           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
           We are once again asked - nay,
           commanded - to consider a proposed
           thirteenth amendment which, if
           passed, shall set at immediate
           liberty four million coloreds while
           manacling the limbs of the white
           race in America. If it is passed -
           but it shall not pass!
                         
          Wild cheering and booing.
                         
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) ROBERT LATHAM

           oyster.
                         
          Thaddeus Stevens calls out from his desk.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           A point of order, Mr. Speaker, if
           you please? When will Mr. Wood -
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor
           and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
           is out of order!
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           - when will Mr. Wood conclude his
           interminable gabble? Some of us
           breathe oxygen, and we find the
           mephitic fumes of his oratory a
           lethal challenge to our pleural
           capacities.
                         
          Wild cheering, applause from the Republicans.

                          FERNANDO WOOD
           We shall oppose this amendment, and
           any legislation that so affronts
           natural law, insulting to God as to
           man! Congress must never declare
           equal those whom God created
           unequal!
                         
          The Democrats cheer. Mary watches with concern. Mrs. Keckley
          is angry and uncomfortable.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Slavery is the only insult to
           natural law, you fatuous

           Order! Procedure! Mr. Speaker, Mr.
           Wood has the floor!
                          (TO STEVENS:)
           Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner,
           what is unnatural, in your opinion?
           Niggrahs casting ballots? Niggrah
           representatives? Is that natural,
           Stevens? Intermarriage?
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           What violates natural law? Slavery,
           and you, Pendleton, you insult God,
           you unnatural noise.
                         
          An avalanche of boos and cheers as Democrats surge towards
          Wood, Republicans towards Stevens. Ashley rushes to Colfax,
                         CALLING:
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Mr. Colfax! Please, use your gavel!
           They are -
           (to the Democrats:)
           You are out of order!
                          (TO COLFAX:)
           Direct the sergeant of arms to
           suppress this!
           (back to the Democrats:)
           We are in session!
                         
                         
          INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          The corridor as usual is lined with petitioners. They've
          lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting,
          laughing, clapping and cheering, egging on Tad as, with
          furious concentration, he drives a cart pulled at
          considerable speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down
           38.

          ROBERT LINCOLN, 21, enters from the stairs carrying several
          pieces of large and heavy luggage.
                         
          Tad sees him, jumps out of the goat cart, runs up to and
          tackles Robert, causing him to drop his luggage. They embrace
          as Pendel captures the goat and leads it away.
                         
                          TAD

           I am. Your goat got big.
                         
          Robert disentangles himself from Tad and hands him a
          suitcase.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)

           door to Mary's bedroom
                          SUITE:)
           Is she in there?
                         
          As Robert hoists the rest of the luggage himself, Tad
          chatters and A PETITIONER comes forward. He grabs the trunk
          as Robert's lifting it.
           39.

          Robert wrestles the trunk out of the man's grasp just as Mary
          enters the hall and sees him.
                         
                          MARY
           He's here...

          She instantly eyes Robert's amount of luggage with suspicion.

          Robert's face, looking concerned.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           You forget to eat, exactly like
           him.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS)
           No...
                         
                          MARY
           You'll linger a few days extra,
           after the reception, before you go
           back to school.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go
           back to -
                         
          She stops him with an alarmed look.
                         
                          MARY
           We'll fatten you up before you
           return to Boston.
                         
                          ROBERT
           All right, mama.
                         
                          MARY
           All right.

           Oh Robbie...
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Preston Blair, still in his traveling cloak, and Lincoln
          stand near the fireplace facing one another.
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           Jefferson Davis is sending three
           delegates: Stephens, Hunter and
           Campbell: Vice President of the
           Confederacy, their former Secretary
           of State, and their Assistant
           41.
                         
                         
           Secretary of War. They're coming in
           earnest to propose peace.
                         
          Both men look into the fire. Preston moves closer.
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D)
           I know this is unwelcome news for
           you. Now hear me: I went to
           Richmond to talk to traitors, to
           smile at and plead with traitors,
           because it'll be spring in two
           months, the roads'll be passable,
           the Spring slaughter commences.
           Four bloody Springs now! Think of
           my Frank, who you've taken to your
           heart, how you'll blame yourself if
           the war takes my son as it's taken
           multitudes of sons. Think of all
           the boys who'll die if you don't
           make peace. You must talk with
           these men!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I intend to, Preston. And in
           return, I must ask you -
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR LINCOLN
          No, this is not horsetrading, - to support our push for
          this is life and - the amendment when it reaches
                          THE -
                         
          There's a knock on the door.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Not now!
                         
          Robert enters. Nicolay stands behind him, apologetic.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home.
                         
          He shakes hands with his son, stiffly.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Thank you.
                         
           LINCOLN PRESTON BLAIR
           (to Robert:) (pointedly:)
          I'm talking to Preston Blair, You're looking fit, Robert.
          we - Harvard agrees with you. Fit
           ROBERT and rested.
          Mr. Blair.
           42.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (dismissing Robert,
                          UNINTENTIONALLY ABRUPT)
           Just give us a moment please,
           Robert. Thank you.
                         
          He turns to Preston. Robert, stung, hesitates, then leaves
          the room, Nicolay shutting the door behind him.
                         
                          PRESTON BLAIR
           I will procure your votes for you,
           as I promised. You've always kept
           your word to me. Those Southern men
           are coming.
           (taking Lincoln's hand)
           I beg you, in the name of Gentle
                          CHRIST -
                         
           PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) LINCOLN
          Talk peace with these men. Preston, I understand...
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (SHARPLY)
           I understand, Preston.
                         
                         
          EXT. ON THE MALL - AFTERNOON
                         
          JACOB GRAYLOR (D, PA) and Bilbo walk outside the Capitol.
          Graylor looks over the prospectuses.
                         
           ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.)
           We have one abstention so far -
                         
           RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)
           Jacob Graylor -
                         
          Graylor selects one and hands it to Bilbo.
                         
           RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)
           He'd like to be Federal Revenue
           Assessor for the Fifth District of
           Pennsylvania.
                         
                         
          INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - NIGHT
                         
          A small room, two beds, in disarray: newspapers, overflowing
          ashtrays, whiskey bottles empty on the floor. Latham and
          Schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker
          game. Bilbo lies on one of the beds. All three are in their
          shirtsleeves. Seward is at the table.
           43.
                         
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           - so the total of representatives
           voting three weeks from today is
           reduced to 182, which means 122 yes
           votes to reach the requisite two-
           thirds of the House. Assuming all
           Republicans vote for the
           amendment...?
                         
          Seward nods, less assertively than Latham would like.
                         
           ROBERT LATHAM (CONT'D)
           Then, despite our abstention, to
           reach a two-thirds majority we
           remain 20 yeses short.
                         
                         
          INT. THE OLD TAVERN, WASHINGTON - NIGHT
                         
          Bilbo is drinking schooners of beer with EDWIN LECLERK (D,
          OH) and CLAY HAWKINS (D, OH). Hawkins listens as Bilbo gives
          his pitch. LeClerk looks at the prospectuses.
                         
           ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.)
           For which we're seeking from among
           64 lame duck Democrats. Fully 39 of
           these we deem unredeemable no
           votes.
                         
          LeClerk throws his beer in Bilbo's face, soaking Bilbo and
          the prospectuses. Hawkins looks shocked. LeClerk storms out.

                          (DISTASTEFULLY:)
           Thank you for that pithy
           explanation, Mr. Bilbo.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           We've abandoned these 39 to the
           Devil that possesses them.

          Schell stands at the door of a small, grubby row house. He
          presents the folio, warped from its beer bath, to WILLIAM
          HUTTON(D, IN), eyes red from crying, dressed in mourning
          black.
                         
          Hutton slams the door in Schell's face. A funeral wreath that
          adorns the door falls to the ground. A daguerreotype attached
          to the wreath depicts a young officer, Hutton's brother
          Frederick.

           we've been working with a purpose -
                         
          Schell hands Latham a stack of folded prospectuses, each with
          a name scrawled on it.

          EXT. IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL - TWILIGHT
                         
          Representatives Merrick, Lanford, Benson, Stuart and Hanson,
          the New York lame ducks, descend the stairs, discussing the
          opening of the amendment debate, to which they've just been
          listening.
                         
          Latham smoothly holds Hanson back from the group, extending a
          hand, the still pristine portfolio under his arm. He smiles
          as the other NY lame ducks proceed down the stairs, unaware,
          then nods his head back up toward the Capitol steps, where
          Bilbo and Schell wait. Latham opens the folio as he talks to
          Hanson.

          INT. THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT - DAY
                         
          In the grand lobby there are Federal bank windows. Schell is
          in line at one of these behind Giles Stuart, who completes a
          transaction and leaves, counting money. Bilbo, barrelling the
          other way, intentionally slams into Stuart, causing him to
          drop his money. Bilbo and Schell both kneel to help.
           45.
                         
                         
          Schell places the open folio in Stuart's hands. As the men
          pile his recovered money into the folio, Stuart's puzzled,
          then intrigued. Schell gives him a meaningful look.
                         
                         
          CLOSE ON A SMALL WOODEN FILE BOX
                         
          A folded prospectus, now with the name "Stuart" scrawled on
          it, is added to a growing file.

          Visitors file past cabinets containing animal and plant
          specimens and inventions; the line circles around a large
          case in which an amputated leg capped with a brass plate is
          displayed. A sign identifies it: LEFT LEG OF GENERAL DANIEL
          SICKLES, AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 5, 1863.

           Nelson Merrick.
                         
          Latham looks through the case at Schell, who's next to Nelson
          Merrick, who nods, solemnly staring at the leg. Schell
          proffers Merrick the folio. Merrick flips through the folio.

          A hall packed with working men, soaped-up windows. A GYPSY
          FIDDLER saws away. Homer Benson, incongruous in a suit,
          slurps. As he lifts his spoon to his mouth, the folio is
          placed in front of him. He looks over, puzzled, as Schell
          smiles and extends a hand.
                         
          Benson takes the folio. Schell slides his chair closer.

          Bilbo walks with Clay Hawkins, who peruses the folio. Bilbo
          has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder.
          Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear.

           Don't just reach for the highest
           branches. They sway in every

           Uh, boats, they, they make me sick.
                         
          Bilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot.
          Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket.

          Seward hands the last prospectus to Nicolay, who unfolds it,
          places it on top of the other prospectuses, and records
          details about Hawkins's appointment in a notebook. Seward
          smokes a cigar, Nicolay a pipe. Lincoln sits, feet up,
          examining a newspaper.

                          SEWARD
           Well, thus far. Plus Graylor's
           abstention. From tiny acorns and so
           on.

           Office.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           He's selling himself cheap, ain't

                          SEWARD
           He wanted tax collector of the
           Western Reserve - a first-term
           congressman who couldn't manage re-
           election, I felt it unseemly and
           they bargained him down to
           Postmaster.
                          (TO NICOLAY:)
           Scatter `em over several rounds of
           appointments, so no one notices.
           And burn this ledger, please, after
           you're done.
                         
          Lincoln stands.

          Nicolay helps Lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in
          preparation to meet the public.

                          SEWARD
           One last item, an absurdity, but -
           My associates report that among the
           Representatives a fantastical
           rumor's bruited about, which I
           immediately disavowed, that you'd
           allowed bleary old Preston Blair to
           sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff
           Davis to send commissioners up to
           Washington with a peace plan.
                         
          Lincoln is silent. A horrifying reality dawns for Seward:
                         
                          SEWARD (CONT'D)
           I, of course, told them you would
           never...Not without consulting me,
           you wouldn't...Because why on earth
           would you?

          The ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three
          Confederate officials sit: Vice President ALEXANDER STEPHENS,
          53, short; JOHN A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War, 54;
          and Senator R.M.T. HUNTER, 56. They're well-dressed for
          winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled.
                         
          Stephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy
          and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting
          company of Union cavalry and infantry.
                         
          A Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one
          side, driven by TWO BLACK SOLDIERS, stands near broken wagons
          and a derelict cannon. ANOTHER BLACK SOLDIER stands at
          attention by the ambulance's rear door.
                         
          The soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely
          to the ambulance. The Confederate peace commissioners
          hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers. Then
          Stephens pushes past Hunter. He nods to the soldier.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           (with polite dignity:)
           Much obliged.
                         
          He boards the ambulance. His fellow delegates follow in his
          wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers
          before climbing in.

          Nicolay is gone.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm
           Secretary of State! You, you, you
           informally send a reactionary
           dottard, to - What will happen, do
           you imagine, when these peace
           commissioners arrive?

                          SEWARD
          Oh, splendid! And next the
          Democrats will invite `em up to
          hearings on the Hill, and the
          newspapers - well, the newspapers -
          the newspapers will ask "why risk
          enraging the Confederacy over the
          issue of slavery when they're here
          to make peace?" We'll lose every
          Democrat we've got, more than
          likely conservative Republicans
          will join `em, and all our work,
          all our preparing the ground for
          the vote, laid waste, for naught.

          The Blairs have promised support

          these people -
                         
                          SEWARD
          Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?
          You think they'll keep their
          promise once we have heard these
          delegates and refused them? Which
          we will have to do, since their
          proposal most certainly will be
          predicated on keeping their slaves!
                         
                          LINCOLN
          What hope for any Democratic votes,
          Willum, if word gets out that I've
          refused a chance to end the war?
          You think word won't get out? In

                          SEWARD

          Tad, in fancy military uniform, sits on the bed, Gardener's
          box of glass negatives open beside him. He holds up a plate
          to a lamp:
                         
          An old black man with a thick beard and hair, shirtless.
                         
          Tad looks at another plate:
                         
          A young black woman, headscarf, huge ugly scar across her
          cheek and down her neck.
                         
          He studies these with solemn concentration.

          Lincoln is being dressed in formal wear by his valet, WILLIAM

          in his morning suit, is standing by the door.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           The only reason they don't throw
           things and spit on me is `cause
           you're so popular. I can't
           concentrate on, on British
           mercantile law, I don't care about
           British mercantile law. I might not

           It's a sturdy profession, and a

                          ROBERT
           Yes, and I want to be useful, but
           now, not afterwards!
                         
          Slade hands Lincoln his formal gloves.

                          WILLIAM SLADE
           The missus will have you wear `em.
           Don't think about leaving `em.

           occupations!
                         
          He accepts the gloves. Slade laughs a little, Robert scowls.
          Tad holds another glass negative up to the light.

           they'll pay more -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Put `em back in the box. We'll
           return them to Mr. Gardner's studio
           day after next. Be careful with
           `em, now.
           (tugging at his gloves:)
           These things should've stayed on
           the calf.

           When you were a slave, Mr. Slade,
           did they beat you?
                         
                          WILLIAM SLADE
           I was born a free man. Nobody beat
           me except I beat them right back.
                         
          There's a knock on the door and Mrs. Keckley enters.

                          (TO TAD:)
           Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her
           if she was beaten.

           I was beaten with a fire shovel
           when I was younger than you.
                          (TO LINCOLN:)
           You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
           She's in Willie's room.

           She never goes in there.
                         
          Lincoln starts towards the door just as John Hay enters,
          dressed in the uniform of a Brevet Colonel.
           53.
                         
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           The reception line is already
           stretching out the door.
                         
          Robert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as
          Lincoln, Slade, Mrs. Keckley and Hay leave. Robert calls to
                         HIS FATHER:
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'll be the only man over fifteen
           and under sixty-five in this whole
           place not in uniform.
                         
                          TAD
           I'm under fifteen and I have a
           uniform.
                         
          Robert storms out.
                         
          INT. THE PRINCE OF WALES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Lincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against
          the dim afternoon light. There are two beds. One is stripped
          bare. The other is canopied with a thick black veil.
                         
          Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and
          beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is
          seated at the head of the canopied bed. On a nightstand next
          to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book
          of B&O railroad schedules.
                         
          Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12,
          handsome, bright-eyed, confident.
                         
          Lincoln crosses to the window.
                         
                          MARY
           My head hurts so.
                          (BEAT)
           I prayed for death the night Willie
           died. The headaches are how I know
           I didn't get my wish. How to endure
           the long afternoon and deep into
           the night.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I know.
                         
                          MARY
           Trying not to think about him. How
           will I manage?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Somehow you will.
           54.
                         
                         
                          MARY
                          (SAD SMILE:)
           Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every
           party, every... And now, four years
           more in this terrible house
           reproaching us. He was a very sick
           little boy. We should've cancelled
           that reception, shouldn't we?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We didn't know how sick he was.
                         
                          MARY
           I knew, I knew, I saw that night he
           was dying.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Three years ago, the war was going
           so badly, and we had to put on a
           face.
                         
                          MARY
           But I saw Willie was dying. I saw
                          HIM -
                         
          He bends and kisses her hand.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Molly. It's too hard. Too hard.
                         
          Mary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief.
                         
                         
          INT. THE EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower,
          is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving
          line. The Blairs proceed from Mary to Lincoln.
                         
          TITLE: GRAND RECEPTION
                         
                          JANUARY 15
                         
          The enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of
          flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions.
          An orchestra plays.
                         
          Lincoln and Tad stand together. Slade is near Lincoln. Mary's
          a distance away from Lincoln, to his right.
                         
          Robert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as
          he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes.
           55.
                         
                         
          A sea of people surround the President and his family.
          Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to
          greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more
          middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and
          many officers and soldiers.
                         
          Tad watches his father shake hands. Lincoln is in his
          element. He stands close to each person, touches each one
          gently, stoops to be nearer them; he puts everyone at ease.
                         
          He's bothered only by the white kid gloves he's wearing. He
          tugs at the right-hand glove.
                         
                          WILLIAM SLADE
           (with a glance in Mary's)
           She's just ten feet yonder. I'd
           like to keep my job.
                         
          Lincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking
          hand - but keeps the other glove on.
                         
          Approaching Mary on the line, Stevens, Ashley, Senators Bluff
          Wade and CHARLES SUMNER, all in formal wear except Stevens.
                         
                          MARY
           Senator Sumner, it has been much
           too long.
                         
                          CHARLES SUMNER
           "Oh, who can look on that celestial
           face and -"
                         
          Cutting him off, she pretends not to recognize Ashley.
                         
                          MARY
           And...?
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
                          (CONFUSED)
           James Ashley, ma'am, we've met
           several times -
                         
          But she ignores him and greets Stevens.
                         
                          MARY
           (her Southern accent
           becoming more lustrous:)
           Praise Heavens, praise Heavens,
           just when I had abandoned hope of
           amusement, it's the Chairman of the
           House Ways and Means Committee!
                         
          Stevens bows to her.
           56.
                         
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          Mrs. Lincoln.
                         
                          MARY
          Madame President if you please!
                          (LAUGHS)
          Oh, don't convene another
          subcommittee to investigate me,
          sir! I'm teasing! Smile, Senator
          Wade.
                         
                          BLUFF WADE
                          (NOT SMILING:)
          I believe I am smiling, Mrs.
          Lincoln.
                         
                          MARY
          I'll take your word for that, sir!
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          As long as your household accounts
          are in order, Madame, we'll have no
          need to investigate them.
                         
                          MARY
          You have always taken such a
          lively, even prosecutorial interest
          in my household accounts.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          Your household accounts have always
          been so interesting.
                         
                          MARY
          Yes, thank you, it's true, the
          miracles I have wrought out of
          fertilizer bills and cutlery
          invoices. But I had to! Four years
          ago, when the President and I
          arrived, this was pure pigsty.
          Tobacco stains in the turkey
          carpets. Mushrooms, green as the
          moon, sprouting from ceilings! And
          a pauper's pittance allotted for
          improvements. As if your committee
          joined with all of Washington
          awaiting, in what you anticipated
          would be our comfort in squalor,
          further proof that my husband and I
          were prairie primitives, unsuited
          to the position to which an error
          of the people, a flaw in the
          democratic process, had elevated
          us.
           57.
                         
                         
          Lincoln, suddenly without anyone in line to receive, looks to
          see the backlog forming behind the radicals. He notes the
          exchange, but says nothing. Robert sees him looking.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           The past is the past, it's a new
           year now and we are all getting
           along, or so they tell me. I gather
           we are working together! The White
           House and the other House? Hatching
           little plans together?
                         
          Robert leans in to her.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Mother?
                         
                          MARY
           What?
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're creating a bottleneck.
                         
                          MARY
           Oh!
                          (TO STEVENS:)
           Oh, I'm detaining you, and more
           important, the people behind you!
           How the people love my husband,
           they flock to see him, by their
           thousands on public days! They will
           never love you the way they love
           him. How difficult it must be for
           you to know that. And yet how
           important to remember it.
                         
          She gives him a slight, lethal smile. He holds the look; his
          poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and
          perhaps a little admiring.
                         
                         
          INT. THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING
                         
          The kitchen's piled with unwashed cookware, eggshells, flour
          bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the
          detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at
          the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is
          still underway upstairs. Music, the tramp of dancing feet and
          rhythmic clapping is audible.
                         
          A BLACK FOOTMAN carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and
          cups comes down the stairs. He hastily beats a retreat when
          he sees Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens quietly talking amid the
          mess.
           58.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
          Since we have the floor next in the
          debate, I thought I'd suggest you
          might...temper your contributions
          so as not to frighten our
          conservative friends?
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          Ashley insists you're ensuring
          approval by dispensing patronage to
          otherwise undeserving Democrats.
                         
                          LINCOLN
          I can't ensure a single damn thing
          if you scare the whole House with
          talk of land appropriations and
          revolutionary tribunals and
          punitive thisses and thats -
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          When the war ends, I intend to push
          for full equality, the Negro vote
          and much more. Congress shall
          mandate the seizure of every foot
          of rebel land and every dollar of
          their property. We'll use their
          confiscated wealth to establish
          hundreds of thousands of free Negro
          farmers, and at their side soldiers
          armed to occupy and transform the
          heritage of traitors. We'll build
          up a land down there of free men
          and free women and free children
          and freedom.
          The nation needs to know that we
          have such plans.
                         
                          LINCOLN
          That's the untempered version of
          reconstruction. It's not... It's
          not exactly what I intend, but we
          shall oppose one another in the
          course of time. Now we're working
          together, and I'm asking you -
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
          For patience, I expect.
                         
                          LINCOLN
          When the people disagree, bringing
          them together requires going slow
          till they're ready to make up -
           59.
                         
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Ah, shit on the people and what
           they want and what they're ready
           for! I don't give a goddamn about
           the people and what they want! This
           is the face of someone who has
           fought long and hard for the good
           of the people without caring much
           for any of `em. And I look a lot
           worse without the wig. The people
           elected me! To represent them! To
           lead them! And I lead! You ought to
           try it!
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,
           and I have tried to profit from the
           example of it. But if I'd listened
           to you, I'd've declared every slave
           free the minute the first shell
           struck Fort Sumter; then the border
           states would've gone over to the
           confederacy, the war would've been
           lost and the Union along with it,
           and instead of abolishing slavery,
           as we hope to do, in two weeks,
           we'd be watching helpless as
           infants as it spread from the
           American South into South America.
                         
          Stevens glares at him, then smiles.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Oh, how you have longed to say that
           to me. You claim you trust them -
           but you know what the people are.
           You know that the inner compass
           that should direct the soul toward
           justice has ossified in white men
           and women, north and south, unto
           utter uselessness through
           tolerating the evil of slavery.
           White people cannot bear the
           thought of sharing this country's
           infinite abundance with Negroes.
                         
          Lincoln reaches over to Stevens and gives his shoulder a
          vigorous shake. Stevens endures this.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           A compass, I learnt when I was
           surveying, it'll - it'll point you
           True North from where you're
           standing, but it's got no advice
           60.
                         
                         
           about the swamps and deserts and
           chasms that you'll encounter along
           the way. If in pursuit of your
           destination you plunge ahead,
           heedless of obstacles, and achieve
           nothing more than to sink in a
           swamp, what's the use of knowing
           True North?
                         
                         
          INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Spectacles on, Lincoln unlaces Mary's corset.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Robert's going to plead with us to
           let him enlist.
                         
          He's unlaced enough; she unhooks the front and steps out of
          her corset and petticoats, turns to him in her plain thin
          chemise and drawers.
                         
                          MARY
           Make time to talk to Robbie. You
           only have time for Tad.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Tad's young.
                         
                          MARY
           So's Robert. Too young for the
           army.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Plenty of boys younger than Robert
           signing up...
                         
                          MARY
           Don't take Robbie. Don't let me
           lose my son.
                         
          There's a knock on the door. Mary turns to it, furious:
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           Go away! We're occupied!
                         
          Lincoln opens the door. Nicolay's standing there.
                         
                          JOHN NICOLAY
           Secretary Stanton has sent over to
           tell you that as of half an hour
           ago, the shelling of Wilmington
           harbor has commenced.
           61.
                         
                         
          Lincoln leaves with Nicolay. Mary watches, frozen, unable to
          let him go, knowing she can't stop him.
                         
                         
          INT. THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
                         
          The telegraph office looks improvised, even after four years.
          Formerly the War Department library, it's lined with
          bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches. Telegraph cables
          stretch across the ceiling to the cipher-operators' desks.
                         
          Stanton, perpetually exhausted and impatient, storms down the
          stairs with Welles and the chief telegraph operator, MAJOR
          THOMAS ECKERT, 40, in his wake.
                         
                          STANTON
           They cannot possibly maintain under
           this kind of an assault. Terry's
           got ten thousand men surrounding
           the Goddamned fort! Why doesn't he
           answer my cables?
                         
           WELLES MAJOR ECKERT
          Fort Fisher is a mountain of It's the largest fort they
          a building, Edwin. Twenty-two have, sir. They've been
          big seacoast guns on each reinforcing it for the last
          rampart - two years -
                         
          They reach the desks for the key operators. Among these,
          SAMUEL BECKWITH, 25, and the key manager, DAVID HOMER BATES,
          22, sit at their silent keys, waiting to receive news.
          Stanton scribbles furiously on Beckwith's small notepad.
                         
                          STANTON (CONT'D)
           They've taken 17,000 shells since
           yesterday!
                         
                          WELLES STANTON
          The commander is an old goat. I want to hear that Fort
           Fisher's ours and Wilmington
           MAJOR ECKERT has fallen!
          They said -
                         
                          STANTON (CONT'D)
           Send another damn cable!
                         
          Stanton thrusts the cable at Beckwith, who taps it out
          immediately.
                         
          Stanton turns to a table where the large map of Wilmington
          from the Cabinet meeting is laid out, heavily scribbled-on.
          GUSTAVUS FOX, assistant Secretary of the Navy, and CHARLES
          BENJAMIN, Stanton's clerk, are checking the marks on the map
          against a stack of dispatches.
           62.
                         
                         
                          STANTON (CONT'D)
           The problem's their commander,
           Whiting. He engineered the fortress
           himself. The damned thing's his
           child; he'll defend it till his
           every last man is gone. He is not
           thinking rationally, he's -
                         
           LINCOLN (O.C.)
           (hollering!)
           "Come on out, you old rat!"
                         
          Everyone's startled, and confused. They all turn to Lincoln,
          who sits in Major Eckert's chair, wrapped in his shawl.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           That's what Ethan Allen called to
           the commander of Fort Ticonderoga
           in 1776. "Come on out, you old
           rat!" `Course there were only forty-
           odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But,
           but there is one Ethan Allen story
           that I'm very partial to -
                         
                          STANTON
           No! No, you're, you're going to
           tell a story! I don't believe that
           I can bear to listen to another one
           of your stories right now!
                         
          Stanton stalks out, shouting down the corridor as he goes:
                         
                          STANTON (CONT'D)
           I need the B&O sideyard schedules
           for Alexandria! I asked for them
           this morning!
                         
          Lincoln pays no attention to Stanton's fulminations and
          continues with his story.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It was right after the Revolution,
           right after peace had been
           concluded, and Ethan Allen went to
           London to help our new country
           conduct its business with the king.
           The English sneered at how rough we
           are, and rude and simple-minded and
           on like that, everywhere he went,
           till one day he was invited to the
           townhouse of a great English lord.
           Dinner was served, beverages
           imbibed, time passed, as happens,
           and Mr. Allen found he needed the
           63.
                         
                         
           privy. He was grateful to be
           directed thence - relieved you
           might say.
                         
          Everyone laughs.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Now, Mr. Allen discovered on
           entering the water closet that the
           only decoration therein was a
           portrait of George Washington.
           Ethan Allen done what he came to do
           and returned to the drawing room.
           His host and the others were
           disappointed when he didn't mention
           Washington's portrait. And finally
           His Lordship couldn't resist, and
           asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it,
           the picture of Washington. He had.
           Well, what did he think of its
           placement, did it seem
           appropriately located to Mr. Allen?
           Mr. Allen said it did. His host was
           astounded! Appropriate? George
           Washington's likeness in a water
           closet? Yes, said Mr. Allen, where
           it'll do good service: the whole
           world knows nothing'll make an
           Englishman shit quicker than the
           sight of George Washington.
                         
          Everyone laughs.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I love that story.
                         
          Beckwith's and Bates's keys starts clicking. They transcribe
          furiously.
                         
          There's a general rush to the operators' desks. Lincoln walks
          quickly over, and is joined there by Stanton, who arrives
          just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being
          decoded. Stanton and Lincoln hold hands, as they've done many
          times, waiting for news of the battle.
                         
          Bates hands the decoded cable to Benjamin, who reads it
          quickly, then announces to the room:
                         
                          CHARLES BENJAMIN
           Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken
           the port.
                         
                          WELLES
           And Wilmington?
           64.
                         
                         
          Eckert shakes his head as Beckwith hands him the next
          telegram.
                         
                          MAJOR ECKERT
           We've taken the fort, but the city
           of Wilmington has not surrendered.
                         
          A beat as this sinks in. Then:
                         
                          STANTON
           How many casualties?
                         
          Eckert looks up at Stanton and Lincoln, stricken.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          One representative's reading a paper with the headline: THE
          FALLEN AT WILMINGTON, followed by hundreds of names.
                         
          Pendleton and Wood are conferring.

           Heavy losses.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           And more to come.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Sours the national mood. That might
           suffice to discourage him -
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           To what? To bring this down? Not in
           a fight like this. This is to the
           death.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           It's gruesome!
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
                          (GETTING UPSET:)
           Are you despairing, or merely lazy?
           This fight is for The United States
           of America! Nothing "suffices". A
           rumor? Nothing! They're not lazy!
           They're busily buying votes! While
           we hope to be saved by "the
           national mood?!"
                         
          He looks over at Stevens, who's at his desk consulting with
          Ashley and Julian.

           Before this blood is dry, when
           Stevens next takes the floor, taunt
           him - you excel at that - get him
           to proclaim what we all know he
           believes in his coal-colored heart:
           that this vote is meant to set the
           black race on high, to niggerate
           America.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           George, please. Stay on course.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           Bring Stevens to full froth. I can
           ensure that every newspaperman from
           Louisville to San Francisco will be
           here to witness it and print it.

          approaches the podium.

           I thank you, Speaker Colfax.
                         
          The Democrats applaud as Yeaman takes his place at the podium
          and surveys the chamber.

           Although I'm disgusted by slavery
           I rise on this sad and solemn day
           to announce that I'm opposed to the
           amendment. We must consider what
           will become of colored folk if four
           million are in one instant set
           free.

           Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman
           switched.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           (shaking his head:)
           Too publicly against us. He can't
           change course now.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Not for some miserable little job
           anyways.
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
           And, and! We will be forced to
           enfranchise the men of the colored
           race - it would be inhuman not to!
           Who among us is prepared to give
           Negroes the vote?
                         
          He's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the
          chamber.
                         
           GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D)
           And, and! What shall follow upon
           that? Universal enfranchisement?
           Votes for women?
                         
          Yeaman is stopped, baffled and dismayed by the explosion he's
          provoked.
                         
                         
          INT. AN EMPTY COMMITTEE ROOM, THE CAPITOL - DAY
                         
          Hawkins enters and stops when he sees Pendleton and Wood.
          It's a trap. LeClerk follows, closing the door.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post
           Master of Millersburg Ohio!
                         
          Hawkins looks at LeClerk, who guiltily avoids his glance.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to
           inform us. Of your disgusting
           betrayal. Your prostitution.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?
           Is your maidenly virtue for sale?
                         
          Hawkins sinks.

          Bilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods. Bilbo, with
          his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges.
                         
                          CLAY HAWKINS
           My neighbors hear that I voted yes
           for nigger freedom and no to peace,
           they will kill me.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           A deal's a deal and you men know
           better than to piss your pants just
           cause there's talk about peace
           talks.
                         
                         
           W.N. BILBO (CONT'D) CLAY HAWKINS
          My neighbors in Nashville, Look, I'll find another job.
          they found out I was loyal to
          the Union, they came after me
          with gelding knives!
                         
          Hawkins runs away from Bilbo. Bilbo chases him.
           CLAY HAWKINS W.N. BILBO
           (to himself, as he YOU DO RIGHT, CLAY HAWKINS!
           runs:) AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME MONEY

                          CLAY HAWKINS
           (turning back to Bilbo:)
           I want to do right! But I got no
           courage!!!
                         
          Hawkins runs away, sobbing. Bilbo pursues.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax
           man for the Western Reserve, hell
           you can have the whole state of
           Ohio if you -
                         
          Bilbo stops, winded.
                         
           W.N. BILBO (CONT'D)
           Aw, crap.

          Seward, smoking unhappily, strides toward his carriage, with
          Schell, Latham and Bilbo in pursuit.
           68.

           Eleven votes?! Two days ago we had

           RICHARD SCHELL ROBERT LATHAM
          It's the goddamned rumors There are defections in the

           SEWARD ROBERT LATHAM
          Groundless. I told you that. And yet the rumors persist.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           They are ruining us.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Among the few remaining
           representatives who seem remotely
           plausible there is a perceptible
           increase in resistance.
                         
          Seward has reached the carriage, Bilbo alongside him. Before
          the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the
          carriage door. Seward is outraged.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Resistance, hell! Thingamabob

           approached him, the sumbitch near

          EXT. A STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT
                         
          Bilbo is talking to HAROLD HOLLISTER (D, IN), who pulls out a
          derringer. Bilbo bolts, dropping the folder. He stops, runs
          back, and bends to retrieve the folio as Hollister fires the
          gun over Bilbo's head.
                         
                         
          EXT. IN A BACK ALLEY, SOMEWHERE IN WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON
                         
          Seward, now inside the carriage, slams the door.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Perhaps you push too hard.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           I push nobody. Perhaps we need
           reinforcements. If Jeff Davis wants
           to cease hostilities, who do you
           think'll give a genuine solid shit
           to free slaves?

           Get back to it, and good day,
           gentlemen.
                         
          Schell and Latham lean in to the carriage.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           We are at an impasse.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors.
           Publicly.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Tell us what you expect of us.
                         
                          SEWARD
           I expect you to do your work! And
           to have sufficient sense and taste
           not to presume to instruct the
           President. Or me.
                         
          Schell steps up on the running board, intent.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Is there a Confederate offer or
           not?

          ULYSSES S. GRANT, 43, 5'7", beard, uniform worn and rumpled,
          crosses the dock, followed by three aides.
                         
          They approach the gangway for the River Queen.

          Grant and the commissioners stand in an expansive cabin at
          the stern, patriotically decorated, large windows.
                         
          Grant hands the commissioners' peace proposal back to them.
          He's scribbled notes all over the document.
                         
                          GRANT
           I suggest you work some changes to
           your proposal before you give it to
           the President.
                         
           R.M.T HUNTER
           We're eager to be on our way to
           Washington.
           70.
                         
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us
           this, General Grant?
                         
          Grant fixes Stephens with a look - bemused, a little
          disappointed.
                         
                          GRANT
           It says..."securing peace for our
           two countries." And it goes on like
           that.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           I don't know what you -
                         
                          GRANT
           There's just one country. You and
           I, we're citizens of that country.
           I'm fighting to protect it from
           armed rebels. From you.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           But Mr. Blair told us, he, he told
           President Davis we were -
                         
                          GRANT
           A private citizen like Preston
           Blair can say what he pleases,
           since he has no authority over
           anything. If you want to discuss
           peace with President Lincoln,
           consider revisions.
                         
          He lights a cigar.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           If we're not to discuss a truce
           between warring nations, what in
           heaven's name can we discuss?
                         
                          GRANT
           Terms of surrender.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE JAMES RIVER DOCK AT CITY POINT, VIRGINIA - DAY
                         
          As a somber Grant disembarks with his aides from the River

          Seward's in a fancy robe and slippers, reading a telegram.
                         
                          SEWARD
           "...will have a bad influence.

          Lincoln is in his coat, shawl over his shoulders, holding his
          hat.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           After four years of war and near
           600,000 lives lost. He believes we
           can end this war now.
           My trust in him is marrow deep.
                         
          Seward looks up at Lincoln, then down again at the telegram.
          He stands and crosses to Lincoln.
                         
                          SEWARD
           You could bring the delegates to
           Washington. In exchange for the
           South's immediate surrender, we
           could promise them the amendment's
           defeat. They'd agree, don't you
           think? We'd end the war. This week.
                         
          Lincoln has closed his eyes.

                          SEWARD (CONT'D)
           The peace delegation might
           encounter delays as they travel up
           the James River. Particularly with
           the fighting around Wilmington.
           Within ten days time, we might pass
           the Thirteenth Amendment.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
                         
          Lincoln, shawl still wrapped around him, walks the long empty
          hall.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
                         
          Lincoln sits before an open window. He's dishevelled, in
          shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers
          and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a
          candlestick, guttering. Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and
          in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain,
          his open pocket watch. His bare left foot keeps time with the
          watch's loud ticking. He stares out into the cold night.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHN HAY AND JOHN NICOLAY'S BEDROOM - EVEN LATER
                         
          The room is spare and neat. Nicolay and Hay are asleep in
          their beds.
                         
          Lincoln is sitting at the foot of Hay's bed, spectacles on,
          reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Now, here's a sixteen year old boy.
           They're going to hang him...
                         
          Hay startles awake, then settles. He's used to this.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           (he reads a little
                          FURTHER:)
           He was with the 15th Indiana
           Calvary near Beaufort, seems he
           lamed his horse to avoid battle.
           I don't think even Stanton would
           73.
                         
                         
           complain if I pardoned him? You
           think Stanton would complain?
                         
          Nicolay stirs in the next bed.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           Ummm... I don't know, sir, I don't
           know who you're, uh... What time is
           it?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It's three forty in the morning.
                         
                          JOHN NICOLAY
           (not waking up:)
           Don't... let him pardon any more
           deserters...
                         
          Nicolay's asleep again.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too
           many. He's generally apoplectic on
           the subject -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           He oughtn't to have done that,
           crippled his horse, that was cruel,
           but you don't just hang a sixteen
           year old boy for that -
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           Ask the horse what he thinks.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           - for cruelty. There'd be no
           sixteen year old boys left.
           (a beat, then:)
           Grant wants me to bring the secesh
           delegates to Washington.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           So... There are secesh delegates?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (scribbling a note,
           signing the petition:)
           He was afraid, that's all it was.
           I don't care to hang a boy for
           being frightened, either. What good
           would it do him?
                         
          He signs the pardon. Then he gives Hay's leg a few hard
          thwacks and a squeeze. It hurts a little. Hay winces.
           74.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           War's nearly done. Ain't that so?
           What use one more corpse? Any more
           corpses?
                         
          Putting the rest of the petitions on Hay's bed, he stands to
          leave.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           Do you need company?
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE WHITE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
                         
          As before, Lincoln continues his slow and solitary walk.
                         
           LINCOLN (V.O.)
           Times like this, I'm best alone.
                         
                         
          INT. THE TELEGRAPH ROOM, WAR DEPARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Lincoln is seated at Eckert's desk, shawl wrapped around his
          shoulders, glasses on; he stares down into his hat, held
          between his knees. Homer Bates and Sam Beckwith are waiting
          for him.
                         
          Lincoln draws a handwritten note from his hat and carefully
          unfolds it.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           "Lieutenant General Ulysses S.
           Grant, City Point. I have read your
           words with interest."
                         
          Sam Beckwith transcribes Lincoln's words into code on a pad
          with a pencil.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           "I ask that, regardless of any
           action I take in the matter of the
           visit of the Richmond
           commissioners, you maintain among
           your troops military preparedness
           for battle, as you have done until
           now."
                         
          He stops for a moment. Beckwith waits, pencil poised.
                         
          Lincoln looks at the note, folds it, tucks it in a band
          inside his hat.
           75.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           "Have Captain Saunders convey the
           commissioners to me here in
           Washington."
                          (ANOTHER PAUSE)
           "A. Lincoln." And the date.
                         
                          SAMUEL BECKWITH
                          (WHILE WRITING:)
           Yes sir.
                         
          Lincoln places the hat on the floor.
                         
           SAMUEL BECKWITH (CONT'D)
           Shall I transmit, sir?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (a beat, then:)
           You think we choose to be born?
                         
                          SAMUEL BECKWITH
           I don't suppose so.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Are we fitted to the times we're
           born into?
                         
                          SAMUEL BECKWITH
           I don't know about myself. You may
           be, sir. Fitted.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (TO HOMER:)
           What do you reckon?
                         
                          HOMER BATES
           I'm an engineer. I reckon there's
           machinery but no one's done the
           fitting.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           You're an engineer, you must know
           Euclid's axioms and common notions.
                         
                          HOMER BATES
           I must've in school, but...
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I never had much of schooling, but
           I read Euclid, in an old book I
           borrowed. Little enough ever found
           its way in here -
           (touching his cranium)
           - but once learnt it stayed learnt.
           76.
                         
                         
           Euclid's first common notion is
           this: "Things which are equal to
           the same thing are equal to each
           other."
                         
          Homer doesn't get it; neither does Sam.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           That's a rule of mathematical
           reasoning. It's true because it
           works; has done and always will do.
           In his book, Euclid says this is
           "self-evident."
                          (A BEAT)
           D'you see? There it is, even in
           that two-thousand year old book of
           mechanical law: it is a self-
           evident truth that things which are
           equal to the same thing are equal
           to each other. We begin with
           equality. That's the origin, isn't
           it? That balance, that's fairness,
           that's justice.
                         
          He looks at his scribbled note, then at Sam and Homer.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Read me the last sentence of my
           telegram.
                         
                          SAMUEL BECKWITH
           "Have Captain Saunders convey the
           commissioners to me here in
           Washington."
                         
                          LINCOLN
           A slight emendation, Sam, if you
           would.
                         
          Beckwith writes as Lincoln dictates.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           "Have Captain Saunders convey the
           gentlemen aboard the River Queen as
           far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and
           there wait until..."
                          (BEAT)
           "...further advice from me. Do not
           proceed to Washington."
           77.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE MORNING
                         
          The chamber's noisy and packed. In the balcony's front row, a
          wall of newspapermen, notebooks at the ready.
                         
          TITLE: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

          Ashley, Colfax, and Stevens approach Stevens's desk. Colfax
          nods towards the journalists in the balcony:
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           The World, the Herald and the
           Times, New York, Chicago, the
           Journal of Commerce, even your
           hometown paper's here.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
                          (TO STEVENS:)
           Say you believe only in legal
           equality for all races, not racial
           equality, I beg you, sir.
           Compromise. Or you risk it all.
                         
          Stevens sees Mary, with Mrs. Keckley, claiming front seats
          from two journalists.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATER
                         
          Stevens, at the podium, is being challenged by Fernando Wood,
          standing at his desk.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           I've asked you a question, Mr.
           Stevens, and you must answer me. Do
           you or do you not hold that the
           precept that "all men are created
           equal" is meant literally?
                         
          All eyes are on Stevens, the chamber quiet except for a
          scratching sound: the journalists have begun scribbling.
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
           Is that not the true purpose of the
           amendment? To promote your ultimate
           and ardent dream to elevate -

           78.
                         
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           You have always insisted, Mr.
           Stevens, that Negroes are the same
           as white men are.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           The true purpose of the amendment -
                         
          Stevens looks up at the balcony, at the waiting journalists,
          and Mary, who raises her eyebrows, then at Ashley and Litton
          at their desks. Seward watches from the balcony.
                         
          Stevens returns to Wood.
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           I don't hold with equality in all
           things only with equality before
           the law and nothing more.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
                          (SURPRISED:)
           That's not so! You believe that
           Negroes are entirely equal to white
           men. You've said it a thousand
                          TIMES -
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON

          Pendleton persists, through cheers and catcalls.

           79.
                         
                         
          Among the amendment's supporters, including Vintner Litton, a
          GROUP OF WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS in the balcony, and Elizabeth
          Keckley, there's visible, audible shock and dismay at
          Stevens's capitulation. Mary's surprised by Stevens, and
          impressed.
                         
                          MARY
           (whispering to Mrs.
                          KECKLEY:)
           Who'd ever've guessed that old
           nightmare capable of such control?
           He might make a politician someday -
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
                          (STANDING ABRUPTLY:)
           I need to go.
                         
          Mary's startled. Mrs. Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing
          past journalists. On the floor:
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           Your frantic attempt to delude us
           now is unworthy of a
           representative. It is, in fact,
           unworthy of a white man!
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           (giving in to his anger:)
           How can I hold that all men are
           created equal, when here before me -
           (pointing to Pendleton:)
           - stands stinking the moral carcass
           of the gentleman from Ohio, proof
           that some men are inferior, endowed
           by their Maker with dim wits
           impermeable to reason with cold
           pallid slime in their veins instead
           of hot red blood! You are more
           reptile than man, George, so low
           and flat that the foot of man is
           incapable of crushing you!
                         
          General uproar.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           HOW DARE YOU!
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Yet even you, Pendleton, who should
           have been gibbetted for treason
           long before today, even worthless
           unworthy you ought to be treated
           equally before the law! And so
           again, sir, and again and again and
           80.
                         
                         
           again I say: I DO NOT HOLD WITH
           EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS. ONLY WITH
           EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.
                         
          Ashley sits, nearly weeping with relief, while the chamber
          explodes: laughter, applause, boos.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS
           VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO
           THREATEN ME AND -
                         
          The journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not
          newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it.
                         
          Stevens limps out through the aisle to wild Republican
          applause. He looks up to the balcony; Mary is looking down
          approvingly. He looks down before she can see him smile.
                         
                         
          INT. A CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER - LATER
                         
          Stevens sits on a bench, alone, thinking, troubled. Asa
          Vintner Litton approaches him.
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           You asked if ever I was surprised.
                         
          Stevens nods.
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON (CONT'D)
           Today, Mr. Stevens, I was
           surprised. You've led the battle
           for race equality for thirty years!
           The basis of, of every hope for
           this country's future life, you
           denied Negro equality! I'm
           nauseated. You refused to say that
           all humans are, well... human! Have
           you lost your very soul, Mr.
           Stevens? Is there nothing you won't
           say?
                         
          Stevens nods, then, quietly:
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa,
           that must be unpleasant.
           I want the amendment to pass. So
           that the Constitution's first and
           only mention of slavery is its
           absolute prohibition. For this
           amendment, for which I have worked
           all of my life and for which
           81.
                         
                         
           countless colored men and women
           have fought and died and now
           hundreds of thousands of soldiers -
           no, sir, no, it seems there is very
           nearly nothing I won't say.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON - MORNING
                         
          Lincoln and Robert are in the buggy driven by the old
          soldier; a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver,
          his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs. Lincoln is on one
          side reading over a stack of documents. Robert's on the other
          side of the buggy, staring sullenly at his feet.
                         
          The buggy stops outside an army hospital. Lincoln packs up
          his papers.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm not going in.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           You said you wanted to help me.
                         
                          ROBERT
           This is - This is just a clumsy
           attempt at discouragement. I've
           been to army hospitals, I've seen
           surgeries, I went and visited the
           malaria barges with mama.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           She told me she didn't take you
           inside.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I snuck in after - I've seen what
           it's like. This changes nothing.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           At all rates, I'm happy to have
           your company.
                         
          Stepping out of the buggy, he hands his folio to the
          bodyguard and enters the army hospital.
                         
                         
          INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING
                         
          He's met in the antechamber by an ARMY SURGEON.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Morning, Jim.
           82.
                         
                         
                          ARMY SURGEON
           Hello, Mr. President.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Good to see you again.
                         
          They move into the main ward, Lincoln removing his hat.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Well, boys, first question: You
           getting enough to eat?
                         
          He walks from bed to bed, shaking hands with each patient.
          Most are amputees.
                         
                          FIRST PATIENT
           Hello, sir.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           What's your name, soldier?
                         
                          FIRST PATIENT
           Robert.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.
                         
                          SECOND PATIENT
           Nice to meet you.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           What's your name?
                         
                          SECOND PATIENT
           Kevin.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Tell me your names as I go past. I
           like to know who I'm talkin' to.
           Kevin.
                         
                          THIRD PATIENT
           Mr. President. John.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           John. I've seen you before.
                         
                          FOURTH PATIENT
           Mr. President...
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTSIDE THE ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING
                         
          Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy.
           83.
                         
                         
          Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO
          BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy
          wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes
          while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.
                         
          Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He
          gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a
          corner of the building.
                         
          Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with
          puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the
          edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,
          revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered
          by bullet or bomb.
                         
          Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
          Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.
                         
          Robert walks away, unsteady.
                         
          Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
          paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
          rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to
          control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic
          attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.
          Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold
          back tears.
                         
           LINCOLN (O.C.)
           What's the matter, Bob?
                         
          Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with
          concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I have to do this! And I will do it
           and I don't need your permission to
           enlist.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           That same speech has been made by
           how many sons to how many fathers
           since the war began? "I don't need
           your damn permission, you miserable
           old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"
           And what wouldn't those numberless
           fathers have given to be able to
           say to their sons - as I now say to
           mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so
           in point of fact, without my
           permission, you ain't enlisting in
           nothing, nowhere, young man."
           84.
                         
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's mama you're scared of, not me
           getting killed.
                         
          Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both.
                         
          Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past
          him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           I have to do this! And I will! Or I
           will feel ashamed of myself for the
           rest of my life. Whether or not you
           fought is what's gonna matter. And
           not just to other people, but to
           myself.
           I won't be you, pa. I can't do
           that. But I don't want to be
           nothing.
                         
          He hurries away.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We can't lose you.
                         
                         
          INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Outside, driving rain and wind. Lincoln sits by the window,
          in his coat, vest and tie, hair combed neatly.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's
           far from the front lines, from the
           fighting, he'll be an adjutant
           running messages for General Grant.
                         
          Mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale
          with rage.
                         
                          MARY
           The war will take our son! A
           sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or
           typhus, same as took Willie, it
           takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll
           die, uselessly, and how will I ever
           forgive you? Most men, their
           firstborn is their favorite, but
           you, you've always blamed Robert
           for being born, for trapping you in
           a marriage that's only ever given
           you grief and caused you regret!
           85.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           That's not true -
                         
                          MARY
           And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor
           is on your hands same as Grant, God
           help us! We'll pay for the oceans
           of spilled blood you've sanctioned,
           the uncountable corpses we'll be
           made to pay with our son's dear
                          BLOOD -
                         
          Lincoln rises from the window seat, angry.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,
           I demand of you to try and take the
           liberal and not the selfish point
           of view! You imagine Robert will
           forgive us if we continue to stifle
           his very natural ambition?!
                         
                          MARY
           (with a mocking smile:)
           And if I refuse to take the high
           road, if I won't take up the rough
           old cross, will you threaten me
           again with the madhouse, as you did
           when I couldn't stop crying over
           Willie, when I showed you what
           heartbreak, real heartbreak looked
           like, and you hadn't the courage to
           countenance it, to help me -
                         
                          LINCOLN MARY
          That's right. When you I was in the room with
          refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in
          Tad - my arms as he died!
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN MARY
          - the child who was not only How dare you!
          sick, dangerously sick, but
          beside himself with grief?
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN MARY
          Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at
          grief, your inexhaustible me?!
          grief!
           86.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN MARY
          And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I
          near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how
          screaming from morning to angry I was!
          night pacing the corridors,
          howling at shadows and
          furniture and ghosts! I ought
          to have done it, I ought have
          done for Tad's sake, for
          everybody's goddamned sake, I
          should have clapped you in
          the madhouse!
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you
           threaten me, you do it this time!
           Lock me away! You'll have to, I
           swear, if Robert is killed!
                         
          Silence. Then:
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I couldn't tolerate you grieving so
           for Willie because I couldn't
           permit it in myself, though I
           wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl
           under the earth, into the vault
           with his coffin. I still do. Every
           day I do.
           Don't... talk to me about grief.
                          (BEAT:)
           I must make my decisions, Bob must
           make his, you yours. And bear what
           we must, hold and carry what we
           must. What I carry within me - you
           must allow me to do it, alone as I
           must. And you alone, Mary, you
           alone may lighten this burden, or
           render it intolerable. As you
           choose.
                         
          She opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and
          watches as he leaves the room.
                         
                         
          INT. ODD FELLOWS' HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT
                         
          Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden
          outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night.
          MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing. The Lincolns, in
          their box, watch quietly. Elizabeth Keckley sits next to
          Mary.
           87.
                         
                         
          Mary turns to Lincoln. They speak in whispers. Mrs. Keckley
          tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say.
                         
                          MARY
           You think I'm ignorant of what
           you're up to because you haven't
           discussed this scheme with me as
           you ought to have done. When have I
           ever been so easily bamboozled?
                          (BEAT)
           I believe you when you insist that
           amending the constitution and
           abolishing slavery will end this
           war. And since you are sending my
           son into the war, woe unto you if
           you fail to pass the amendment.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Seward doesn't want me leaving big
           muddy footprints all over town.
                         
                          MARY
           No one ever lived who knows better
           than you the proper placement of
           footfalls on treacherous paths.
           Seward can't do it. You must.
           Because if you fail to secure the
           necessary votes, woe unto you, sir.
           You will answer to me.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE - A SHORT WHILE LATER
                         
          The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White
          House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage.
                         
          She hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln.
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           I know the vote is only four days
           away; I know you're concerned.
           Thank you for your concern over
           this, and I want you to know:
           They'll approve it. God will see
           to it.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I don't envy him his task. He may
           wish He'd chosen an instrument for
           His purpose more wieldy than the
           House of Representatives.
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           Then you'll see to it.
           88.
                         
                         
          Lincoln looks at her, considering. Then:
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Are you afraid of what lies ahead?
           For your people? If we succeed?
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           White people don't want us here.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Many don't.
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           What about you?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.
           Any of you. You're ...familiar to
           me, as all people are.
           Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked
           creatures such as we all are. You
           have a right to expect what I
           expect, and likely our expectations
           are not incomprehensible to each
           other. I assume I'll get used to
           you. But what you are to the
           nation, what'll become of you once
           slavery's day is done, I don't
           know.
                         
                          ELIZABETH KECKLEY
           What my people are to be, I can't
           say. Negroes have been fighting and
           dying for freedom since the first
           of us was a slave. I never heard
           any ask what freedom will bring.
           Freedom's first. As for me: My son
           died, fighting for the Union,
           wearing the Union blue. For freedom
           he died. I'm his mother. That's
           what I am to the nation, Mr.
           Lincoln. What else must I be?
                         
                         
          INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - LATE NIGHT
                         
          The room is far filthier and more cluttered than before.
          Bilbo and Latham are playing cards. Schell is asleep in bed.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           My whole hand's gonna be proud in
           about five seconds, let's see how
           proud you gonna be.
           89.
                         
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Oh, it is? What you got goin'?
                         
          There's a quick knock on the door.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Yeah?
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Go away!
                          (TO BILBO)
           That watch fob, is that gold?
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           You keep your eyes off my fob!
                         
          Seward enters, displeased, as they show their cards,
          laughing.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Nines paired!
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Oh my God damn!
                         
                          SEWARD
           Gentlemen. You have a visitor.
                         
          Latham jovially collects his winnings. He stops short when
          Lincoln steps into the room, cloak and stovepipe, very tall.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Well, I'll be fucked.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...?
                         
          Schell startles awake as Bilbo puts down his cigar and wipes
          his hand on his vest.
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           W.N. Bilbo.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Sir...
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Why are you here? No offense, but
           Mr. Seward's banished the very
           mention of your name, he won't even
           90.
                         
                         
           let us use fifty-cent pieces `cause
           they got your face on `em.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           The Secretary of State here tells
           me that, uh, you got eleven
           Democrats in the bag. That's
           encouraging.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Oh, you've got no cause to be
           encouraged. Sir. Uh...
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Are we being...fired?
                         
          Lincoln sits at the card table.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           "We have heard the chimes of
           midnight, Master Shallow." I'm here
           to alert you boys that the great
           day of reckoning is nigh upon us.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           The Democrats we've yet to bag,
           sir. The patronage jobs simply
           won't bag `em. They require
           more...convincing, Mr. President.
                         
          Lincoln nods. He turns to Bilbo.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Sure.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Snagged my eye in the paper this
           morning. Governor Curtin is set to
           declare a winner in the disputed
           Congressional election for the -
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Pennsylvania 16th District.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           What a joy to be comprehended. Hop
           on a train to Philadell, call on
           the Governor -
           91.
                         
                         
                          SEWARD
           (looking askance at
                          BILBO'S APPEARANCE:)
           Send Latham. Or Schell.
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (TO BILBO:)
           No, he'll do fine, just polish
           yourself up first.
                         
          Bilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           The incumbent is claiming he won
           it. Name of, uh...
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Coffroth.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           That's him.
                         
                          RICHARD SCHELL
           Coffroth. He is a Democrat.
                         
                         
           LINCOLN W.N. BILBO
          I understand he is. Silly name.
          Let Governor Curtin know it'd
          be much appreciated if he'd
          invite the House of
          Representatives to decide who
          won. He's entitled to do
          that. He'll agree to it.
                          (TO SCHELL:)
          Then advise Coffroth, if he
          hopes to retain his seat,
          that he'd better pay a visit
          to Thaddeus Stevens.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Pity poor Coffroth.
                         
                         
          INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE, THE CAPITOL - NIGHT
                         
          Stevens is at his desk, paperwork piled high. There's a knock
          at the door.

           It opens!
                         
          A nervous man enters hesitantly: Alexander Coffroth.
           92.
                         
                         
          Stevens glares at him with what looks like horror. Coffroth's
          frightened smile transforms into a rictus of pain. Then:
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           You are Canfrey?
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           Coffroth, Mr. Stevens, Alexander
           Coffroth, I'm, I'm -

           Are we representatives of the same
           state?
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           Y-yes sir! We sit only three desks
                          APART -
                         
          Stevens waves him into a chair.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           I haven't noticed you. I'm a
           Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are
           a Democrat?
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           Well, I... Um, that is to say... I -

           like a barnacle has the effrontery
           to call itself The Democratic
           Party. You are a Dem-o-crat.
           What's the matter with you? Are you
           wicked?
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           Well, I felt, um, formerly, I -
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Never mind, Coffsnot. You were
           ignominiously trounced at the
           hustings in November's election by
           your worthy challenger, a
                          REPUBLICAN -
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           No, sir, I was not, um, trounced!
           Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I
           didn't lose the election -

           What difference does it make if you
           lost or not?! The governor of our
           state, is...? A Democrat?

           I know what he is. This is a
           rhetorical exercise. And Congress
           is controlled by what party? Yours?
                         
          Coffroth doesn't know whether to answer. He shakes his head.
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           Your party was beaten, your
           challenger's party now controls the
           House, and hence the House
           Committee on Elections, so you have
           been beaten. You shall shortly be
           sent home in disgrace. Unless.

                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           NO! Coffroth will vote yes but
           Coffroth will remain a Democrat
           until after he does so.

           We want to show the amendment has
           bipartisan support, you idiot.
           Early in the next Congress, when I
           tell you to do so, you will switch
           parties. Now congratulations on
           your victory, and get out.

          INT. SEWARD'S OFFICE, STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY
                         
          Seward sits at his grand desk, looking on with an anxious
          scowl. Lincoln sits on the edge of Seward's desk. Yeaman sits
          in a chair facing him.
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
           I can't vote for the amendment, Mr.
           Lincoln.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,
           filled with colored men in chains,
           heading down the Mississippi to the
           New Orleans slave markets. It
           sickened me, `n more than that, it
           brought a shadow down, a pall
           around my eyes.
                          (BEAT)
           Slavery troubled me, as long as I
           can remember, in a way it never
           troubled my father, though he hated
           it. In his own fashion. He knew no
           smallholding dirt farmer could
           compete with slave plantations. He
           took us out from Kentucky to get
           away from `em. He wanted Indiana
           kept free. He wasn't a kind man,
           but there was a rough moral urge
           for fairness, for freedom in him. I
           learnt that from him, I suppose, if
           little else from him. We didn't
           care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           I... Well, I'm sorry to hear that -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Lovingkindness, that most ordinary
           thing, came to me from other
           sources. I'm grateful for that.
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
           I hate it, too, sir, slavery, but -
           but we're entirely unready for
           emancipation. There's too many
                          QUESTIONS -
           96.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
                          (LAUGHS)
           We're unready for peace too, ain't
           we? When it comes, it'll present us
           with conundrums and dangers greater
           than any we've faced during the
           war, bloody as it's been. We'll
           have to extemporize and experiment
           with what it is when it is.
                         
          Lincoln moves from the desk to take the seat beside Yeaman,
          no longer towering over him. He leans forward and rests a
          hand on Yeaman's knee.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I read your speech, George. Negroes
           and the vote, that's a puzzle.
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
           No, no, but, but, but - But Negroes
           can't, um, vote, Mr. Lincoln.
           You're not suggesting that we
           enfranchise colored people.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I'm asking only that you
           disenthrall yourself from the slave
           powers. I'll let you know when
           there's an offer on my desk for
           surrender.
           There's none before us now. What's
           before us now, that's the vote on
           the Thirteenth Amendment. It's
           going to be so very close.
           You see what you can do.
                         
          Lincoln leaves Yeaman, considering.
                         
                         
          EXT. A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN WASHINGTON - NIGHT
                         
          Lincoln stands in front of William Hutton's row house,
          talking to Hutton. The funeral wreath still hangs on the door
          behind them, displaying the marks of time passing: faded,
          weatherbeaten, dusty.
                         
                          WILLIAM HUTTON
           I can't make sense of it, what he
           died for. Mr. Lincoln, I hate them
           all, I do, all black people. I am a
           prejudiced man.
                         
          The door opens slightly behind Hutton. His wife looks out.
          Hutton exchanges a glance with her, and the door shuts again.
           97.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I'd change that in you if I could,
           but that's not why I come. I might
           be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I
           expect... Colored people will most
           likely be free, and when that's so,
           it's simple truth that your
           brother's bravery, and his death,
           helped make it so. Only you can
           decide whether that's sense enough
           for you, or not.
                         
          Hutton walks slowly back to his house.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           My deepest sympathies to your
           family.
                         
          Lincoln goes back to his buggy. Hutton pauses at his door to
          watch Lincoln's buggy drive away.

           from the Republican right to
           trouble you, whereas as to what you

           Oh God...

           It's true! You, you...lied to me,
           Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests
           for a denial that, that there is a
           Confederate peace offer because,
           because there is one! We are
           absolutely guaranteed to lose the
           whole thing -
           98.

          - and we'll be discredited, We don't need a goddamned
          the amendment itself will be abolition amendment! Leave
          tainted. What if, what if the Constitution alone! State
          these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate -
          appear today? Or worse, on
          the morning -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I can't listen to this anymore! I
           can't accomplish a goddamned thing
           of any human meaning or worth until
           we cure ourselves of slavery and
           end this pestilential war, and
           whether any of you or anyone else
           knows it, I know I need this! This
           amendment is that cure! We're
           stepped out upon the world's stage
           now, now, with the fate of human
           dignity in our hands! Blood's been
           spilt to afford us this moment!
                         
          He points around the table at Ashley, Monty, Preston.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Now now now! And you grousle and
           heckle and dodge about like
           pettifogging Tammany Hall
           hucksters! See what is before you!
           See the here and now! That's the
           hardest thing, the only thing that
           accounts! Abolishing slavery by
           constitutional provision settles
           the fate, for all coming time, not
           only of the millions now in bondage
           but of unborn millions to come. Two
           votes stand in its way, and these
           votes must be procured.
                         
                          SEWARD
           We need two yeses, three
           abstentions, or four yeses and one
           more abstention and the amendment
           will pass -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           You got a night and a day and a
           night and several perfectly good
           hours! Now get the hell out of here
           and get `em!
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Yes but how?
           99.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Buzzards' guts, man.
                         
          Lincoln rises, and keeps rising, till he seems eight feet
          tall.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I am the President of the United
           States of America, clothed in
           immense power! You will procure me
           these votes.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAWN
                         
          The chamber is quiet and dark. Pages and clerks prepare the
          desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells.
                         
          TITLE: THE MORNING OF THE VOTE
                         
           JANUARY 31, 1865
                         
          A CLERK is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of
          representatives from seceded states. These will of course
          remain unoccupied during the vote.
                         
          The first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in.
          He goes to his desk and sits. He looks around the empty
          chamber, ready and waiting.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - MORNING, SEVERAL HOURS LATER
                         
          Thaddeus Stevens is at his desk. The House is in session, the
          floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing.
                         
          The balcony's packed. Mary and Keckley sit at the front,
          Nicolay and Hay behind them. The Blairs are among other
          officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries.
                         
          There's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. Ashley, Stevens and
          everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and
          Hawkins among these.
                         
          In the balcony, twenty WELL-TO-DO BLACK PEOPLE, mostly men,
          are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade,
          to a reserved section of the balcony. The black people glance
          at their surroundings but are rigidly composed.
                         
          Asa Vintner Litton sees them enter. He looks about, at the
          representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors.
          Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with
          emotion, he calls up to the black visitors:
           100.
                         
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           We welcome you, ladies and
           gentlemen, first in the history of
           this people's chamber, to your
           House!
                         
          There's tense applause. Some of the black guests bow; most
          aren't sure how to respond.
                         
          Yeaman watches this, deeply moved.
                         
          Bilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves. Hawkins looks
          anxiously around, blushing.
                         
          Everyone is seated, and the place is packed.
                         
          Schuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the
          SERGEANT-AT-ARMS to his right. Colfax gavels the House into
          session. Ashley is at the podium.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           On the matter of the joint
           resolution before us, presenting a
           Thirteenth Amendment to our
           national Constitution, which was
           passed last year by the Senate, and
           which has been debated now by this
           estimable body for the past several
           weeks. Today we will vote...
                         
          Cheers, boos, applause.
                         
           JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
           By mutual agreement we shall hear
           brief final statements -
                         
          General cheering for this, laughing.
                         
           JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
           - beginning with the honorable
           George Pendleton of Ohio.
                         
          Applause, boos. Pendleton, taking the podium, is handed
          several letters by Wood. He holds them over his head. The
          chamber's quiet.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           I've just received confirmation of
           what previously has been merely
           rumored! Affidavits from loyal
           citizens recently returned from
           101.
                         
                         
           Richmond. They testify that
           Commissioners have indeed come
           north and ought to have arrived by
           now in Washington City! Bearing an
           offer of immediate cessation of our
           civil war!
                         
          The chamber explodes. Through the ensuing ruckus:
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           (to Ashley, fake shock:)
           Are there Confederate commissioners
           in the Capitol?
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           I don't... I have no idea where
           they are or if they've arrived or -
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           If they've arrived?!
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           I appeal to my fellow Democrats, to
           all Republican representatives who
           give a fig for peace! Postpone this
           vote until we have answers from the
           President himself!
                         
          In the balcony, Hay and Nicolay exchange worried glances.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           Postpone the vote!
                         
          Ashley turns to Stevens: "DO SOMETHING!" as Pendleton's
          Democrats begin to chant "POSTPONE THE VOTE!"
                         
          Mary, worried, looks from Mrs. Keckley to Preston Blair, who
          is focused on the leader of the conservative Republican
          representatives, AARON HADDAM (R, KY). Haddam looks up at
          Preston, awaiting instructions.
                         
          Democrats and Republicans rush to the Speaker to support or
          protest the motion.
                         
          In the balcony, Preston slowly stands, saddened and angry.
                         
           FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D)
           I have made a motion! Does anyone
           here care to second -
                         
          Preston nods at Haddam: "Go ahead." Haddam rises.
           102.
                         
                         
                          AARON HADDAM
           (in a powerful voice:)
           Gentlemen.
           The conservative faction of border
           and western Republicans cannot
           approve this amendment, about which
           we harbor grave doubts, if a peace
           offer is being held hostage to its
           success. Joining with our
           Democratic colleagues, I second the
           motion to postpone.
                         
          The debate swells again as, in the balcony, Schell scribbles
          in a notebook while Latham whispers furiously in his ear.
          Latham rips the page out before Schell's finished; Bilbo
          snatches it from him.
                         
                          ROBERT LATHAM
           Quick, man! Quick!
                         
          Bilbo pushes his way out of the balcony. Nicolay, then Hay,
          follow on his heels. Mary sees this; she's concerned.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON
                         
          Hay and Nicolay emerge. They see Bilbo running, far ahead.
          Hay immediately sprints after him and trips. Nicolay
          continues running.
                         
                         
          INT/EXT. WHITE HOUSE PORTICO, FOYER, STAIRS - AFTERNOON
                         
          Bilbo puffs his way across the portico, through the door, and
          up the stairs. Hay gains on him. It's become a race!
                         
          In the second floor hallway, Bilbo gets winded, and Hay
          dashes past him. Hay reaches the doors to Lincoln's office
          and flings them open.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
                         
          Lincoln is at his desk, working, when Hay bursts in. Bilbo
          appears in the doorway, beet-red and gasping for air.
                         
          Hay's too winded to speak. Bilbo holds out the note, limp
          with sweat, and brings it to Lincoln. Lincoln reads it.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           This is precisely what Mr. Wood
           wishes me to respond to?
           103.
                         
                         
          Tad runs into the room, excited by the commotion. He wraps
          his arm around his father's neck, then tears wildly out of
          the room.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           Word for word? This is precisely
           the assurance that he demands of
           me?
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           Yes sir.
                         
          As Nicolay heaves into the room in last place, wheezing
          terribly, Lincoln deliberates for a moment, then writes a
          note. He blots, folds and hands it to Hay, who immediately
          reads it, Nicolay looking on.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Give this to Mr. Ashley.
                         
          Hay looks at Nicolay, who can't speak; he waves at Hay to
          speak for him.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           I feel, um, I have to say, Mr.
           Lincoln, that this -
           (annoyed, impatient, to
                          BILBO:)
           Could you please just step
           outside?!
                         
           W.N. BILBO
           You gonna have a chat now, with
           with the whole of the House of
           Representatives waiting on that?
                         
          Nicolay continues gasping, trying to speak. He can't.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
                          (TO LINCOLN:)
           Making false representation to
           Congress is, it's, um -
                         
                          JOHN NICOLAY
           It's, it's -
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Impeachable. I've made no false
           representation.
                         
                          JOHN HAY
           But there are -
                          (WHISPERING:)
           104.
                         
                         
           There is a delegation from
           Richmond.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Give me the note, Johnnie.
                         
          Hay gives Lincoln the note. Lincoln takes it, holding on to
          Hay's hand; with his free hand, Lincoln passes the note to
          Bilbo.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
                          (TO BILBO:)
           Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON
                         
          Bilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note,
          Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the
          podium. All eyes are on Ashley.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           From the President:
                         
          The chamber falls silent.
                         
           JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D)
           "So far as I know, there are no
           peace commissioners in the city
           nor are there likely to be."
                         
          Applause, booing, furious discussion.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           "So far as I know-"?! That means
           nothing! Are there commissioners
           from the South or aren't there?!
                         
          In the balcony, Mary looks to Mrs. Keckley.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           The President has answered you,
           sir! Your peace offer is a fiction!
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           That is not a denial, it is a
           lawyer's dodge!
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Mr. Haddam? Is your faction
           satisfied?
           105.
                         
                         
          Preston, in the balcony, hesitates. He looks at his daughter,
          who gives him a questioning look: "Do you want this on your
          head?"
                         
          Preston doesn't. He indicates to Haddam with a small shake of
          his venerable head: "Drop it."
                         
                          AARON HADDAM
           The conservative Republican
           faction's satisfied, and we thank
           Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr.
           Wood's motion.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           Tabled!
                         
          There's an angry response, but Wood and Pendleton sit,
          thwarted.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Speaker Colfax, I order the main
           question.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           A motion has been made to bring the
           bill for the Thirteenth Amendment
           to a vote. Do I hear a second?
                         
           ASA VINTNER LITTON
           I second the motion.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           So moved, so ordered. The Clerk
           will now -
           (a rap of the gavel)
           Quiet please.
                         
          The noise of the chamber and balcony reduce to a rumble.
                         
           SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
           The clerk will now call the roll
           for voting.
                         
          Thaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the
          moment has come.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           We begin with Connecticut. Mr.
           Augustus Benjamin, on the matter of
           this amendment, how say you?
                         
          The chamber is completely silent for the first time.
           106.
                         
                         
                          AUGUSTUS BENJAMIN
           Nay!
                         
          The clerk records his vote.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.
                         
                          ARTHUR BENTLEIGH
           Nay!
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. John Ellis, how say you?
                         
                          JOHN ELLIS
           Aye!
                         
          Angry shouts from Ellis's fellow Democrats, forcing Colfax to
          gavel for order.
                         
                          DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
           What?! Shameful!
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Missouri next. Mr. Walter Appleton.
                         
                          WALTER APPLETON
           I vote no!
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Josiah Burton.
                         
          JOSIAH BURTON rises to his feet. He is very, very tall and
          thin.
                         
                          JOSIAH BURTON
           Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote
           yea!
                         
          Mary watches from the balcony, pleased, but anxious.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           The State of New Jersey. Mr.
           Nehemiah Cleary.
                         
                          NEHEMIAH CLEARY
           No.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. James Martinson.
           107.
                         
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Mr. Martinson has delegated me to
           say he is indisposed and he
           abstains.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Austin J. Roberts.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Also indisposed, also abstaining.
                         
          Shocked anger from the Democrats. Pendleton starts
          calculating votes on a sheet of paper. Wood grabs it and
          begins to calculate more rapidly.
                         
          In the balcony, Mary keeps track on her own list. She writes
          carefully next to Roberts's name: "15 TO WIN"
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Illinois concluded. Mr. Harold
           Hollister, how say you?
                         
          Hollister glowers next to Hutton, who's silently praying.
                         
                          HAROLD HOLLISTER
           No.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Hutton? Mr. William Hutton,
           cast your vote.
                         
          Hutton looks up from his prayer.
                         
                          WILLIAM HUTTON
           William Hutton, remembering at this
           moment his beloved brother,
           Fredrick, votes against the
           amendment.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
                         
          Lincoln watches Tad stacking books to make a fort for his
          lead toy soldiers.
                         
                         
          INT/EXT. ROTUNDA AND FRONT DOOR OF THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON
                         
          A field telegraph has been set up near the steps, at the
          front of the enormous crowd that's assembled before the
          Capitol. Poles are held up in the crowd by soldiers along
          which the telegraph wire is stretched.
           108.
                         
                         
          A soldier stationed at the door of the Capitol relays the
          vote to another soldier manning the cipher key:
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Webster Allen votes no.
                         
          The cipher operator instantly transmits.
                         
                         
          INT. GRANT'S TELEGRAPH ROOM AT CITY POINT - AFTERNOON
                         
          OFFICERS are crowded in the small room, watching a SERGEANT
          transcribe as his cipher key clicks.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Webster Allen, Illinois, Democrat,
           votes...no.
                         
          The cipher key clicks again.
                         
                          SERGEANT (CONT'D)
           Halberd Law, Indiana, Democrat,
           votes...no.
                         
          Grant observes this from the balcony above. Robert, in a
          captain's uniform, stands near him. Like his mother, Robert
          has a scorecard, and he's keeping track.
                         
          Grant turns his back on the proceedings to light a cigar.
          He's concerned at how close the vote is. Behind him the count
                         CONTINUES:
                         
                          SERGEANT (CONT'D)
           Archibald Moran...yes.
                         
          Robert has been looking at Grant; he returns to his score
          keeping.
                         
                          SERGEANT (CONT'D)
           Ambrose Bailer...yes.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON
                         
          The Clerk continues.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Walter H. Washburn.
                         
           WALTER H. WASHBURN
           Votes no.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you?
           109.
                         
                         
          Yeaman doesn't respond. The silence this causes lengthens,
          till representatives begin to look to see what's happened.
          Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding. Thaddeus Stevens,
          sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction.
          Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's
          inaudible.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)
           Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn't hear you
                          VOTE -
                         
                          GEORGE YEAMAN
           (rising to his feet)
           I said aye, Mr. McPherson.
           AYE!!!
                         
          Great surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts.
                         
                          FERNANDO WOOD
           TRAITOR! TRAITOR!
                         
          Yeaman looks ready to faint. To the consternation of the
          Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the
          aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman,
          shaking his hand, slapping him on the back. Colfax bangs the
          gavel.
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           Order!
                         
          Pendleton is speechless. Litton turns to Ashley, both
          astonished; Ashley turns to Stevens, who watches, sharp,
          observant, giving nothing away.
                         
          Mary updates her tally: "8 TO WIN"
                         
           SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
           Order in the chamber!
                         
          Yeaman collapses back into his seat. The room quiets.
                         
           SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
           Mr. MacPherson, you may proceed.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio.
                         
          Hawkins seems to have been startled out of a reverie. Sick
          with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name. He can't
          speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed. Hawkins
          snaps out of it.
                         
                          CLAY HAWKINS
           Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.
           110.
                         
                         
          A huge reaction to this. LeClerk gapes at Hawkins.
                         
           CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D)
           (right at Pendleton and
           Wood!)
           I don't care, shoot me dead! You
           shoot me dead I, I am voting yes!
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk.
                         
          LeClerk, seated next to Hawkins and transfixed by his
          courage, turns dazedly to McPherson.
                         
                          EDWIN LECLERK
           No.
           (then, standing abruptly:)
           Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead
           too. Yes!
                         
          The noise gets wilder. Pendleton fixes LeClerk and Hawkins
          with a murderous look.
                         
           EDWIN LECLERK (CONT'D)
           I mean, abstention. Abstention.
                         
          Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses
          out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering
          and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this
          means for the vote count.
                         
          In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Alexander Coffroth.
                         
          Coffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him.
                         
                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH
           (proud of himself and
           happy about the reward
                          HE'LL GET:)
           I. Vote. Yes.
                         
          Applause. Stevens still doesn't look at Coffroth, but,
          tickled, he grins and nods.
                         
                         
          INT. GRANT'S TELEGRAPH ROOM AT CITY POINT - AFTERNOON
                         
          Grant stands with Robert at the balcony rail, waiting.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           James Brooks...nay.
           111.
                         
                         
          On a nearby board, a large map has been tacked backwards; on
          its reverse side, the count is being scrawled by an officer,
          who marks off the votes in quintiles in columns marked YEA
          and NAY.
                         
           SERGEANT AT ARMS
           Josiah Grinnell...yea. Meyer
           Straus...
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON
                         
          STRAUS rises.
                         
                          MEYER STRAUS

           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Joseph Marstern?
                         
                          JOSEPH MARSTERN
           Nay.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Chilton A. Elliot?

           No!
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Daniel G. Stuart?
                         
           DANIEL G. STUART
           I vote yes.

           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. Howard Guilefoyle.

           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Mr. John A. Kassim.

                          AVON HANREADY
           Nay.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           And Mr. Rufus Warren?

           Yea.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
                         
          Tad is on Lincoln's lap. They're examining a book, the pages
          of which feature illustrations comparing the varieties of
          species of insects, zebras, finches.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON
                         
          The room is quiet and tense.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           The roll call concludes, voting is
           completed, now -
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           Mr. Clerk, please call my name, I
           want to cast a vote.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           I object! The Speaker doesn't vote!
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           The Speaker may vote if he so
           chooses.
                         
                          GEORGE PENDLETON
           It is highly unusual, sir -
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           This isn't usual, Mr. Pendleton,
           this is history.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           How does Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?
           113.
                         
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           (a look of surprise that
           this needs to be asked,
           then, stating the
                          OBVIOUS:)
           Aye, of course.
                         
          Laughter in the chamber. The Clerk tallies the vote, then
          passes the recorded vote to the Speaker. There's absolute
          silence.
                         
          In the balcony, Mary checks her own tally, not quite
          believing it.
                         
           SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D)
           The final vote: eight absent or not
           voting, fifty six votes against,
           one hundred nineteen votes for.
           With a margin of two votes -
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
                         
          Lincoln stands, waiting. The only sound is the ticking of
          the clock. And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as
          bells begin to peal throughout the city. Lincoln raises the
          window as Tad rushes to him. The bells are joined by a
          cannonade. The sound of jubilation fills his office.
                         
          Lincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly,
          seeking out the source of the noise. Lincoln puts his hand on
          Tad's head. He looks down at his son, silent.
                         
                         
          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Representatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep,
          shout, dance, climb on desks. In the balcony, Mary stands
          slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs. Keckley stands with her,
          smiling, crying. Preston Blair applauds vigorously. The black
          visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some
          praying, others embracing and weeping.
                         
          Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone.
                         
          Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his
          face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room,
          as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The
          Battle Cry of Freedom."
                         
          Pendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world
          collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening
          to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder.
          Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House.
           114.
                         
                         
          Yeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing.
                         
          Stevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing
          his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a
          folio. He looks up.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?
                         
          The Clerk hands the bill to Stevens, who folds it and pockets
          it.
                         
           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE
           That's...That's the official bill.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           I'll return it in the morning.
           Creased, but unharmed.
                         
                         
          EXT. A STREET, WASHINGTON - DUSK
                         
          Celebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying
          placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment.
                         
          Thaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction,
          making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and
          shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl
          utterly at odds with the prevailing festive mood.
                         
          He reaches a modest house, unlocks the door and steps inside.
                         
                         
          INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Stevens is met at the door by LYDIA SMITH, a black woman in
          her fifties. As she helps him off with his coat, he takes a
          piece of paper from his pocket.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           A gift for you.
                         
          She takes it.
                         
           THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D)
           The greatest measure of the

          INT. THE BEDROOM IN THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Stevens, in his nightgown, takes off his wig. He's bald.
                         
          He lies down in bed. Mrs. Smith is in bed already beside
          him. She's holding the paper he gave her.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           I wish you'd been present.
                         
                          LYDIA SMITH
           I wish I'd been.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           It was a spectacle.
                         
                          LYDIA SMITH
           You can't bring your housekeeper to
           the House. I won't give them
           gossip.
                          (THE PAPER)
           This is enough. This is... It's
           more than enough for now.
                         
          They kiss. He lies back. He grabs her hand.
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           Read it to me again, my love.
                         
                          LYDIA SMITH
                          "PROPOSED -"
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
           And adopted.
                         
                          LYDIA SMITH
           Adopted. "An Amendment to the
           Constitution of the United States.
           Section One: Neither slavery nor
           involuntary servitude, except as a
           punishment for crime whereof the
           party shall have been duly
           convicted, shall exist within the
           United States, or any place subject
           to their jurisdiction."
                         
                          THADDEUS STEVENS
                          SECTION TWO:

          Thaddeus Stevens grins, nods, thinking, eyes sparkling.
                         
                         
          INT./EXT. THE DOCK AT FORTRESS MONROE, HAMPTON ROADS,
          VIRGINIA - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Sailors cheer Lincoln's arrival. Lincoln walks across the
          gangway. Seward greets him amidst the cheers.

          Lincoln, Seward and the commissioners are seated. Seward
          looks concerned at Lincoln's fatigue.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           Let me be blunt. Will the southern
           states resume their former position
           in the Union speedily enough to
           enable us to block ratification of
           the Thirteenth Amendment?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I'd like peace immediately.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           Yes, and...?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I'd like your states restored to
           their practical relations to the
           Union immediately.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           If this could be given me in
           writing, as Vice President of the
           Confederacy, I'd bring that
           document with celerity to Jefferson
           Davis.
                         
                          SEWARD
           Surrender and we can discuss
           reconstruction.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           Surrender won't be thought of
           unless you've assured us, in
           writing, that we'll be readmitted
           in time to block this amendment.
           117.
                         
                         
           R.M.T. HUNTER
           This is the arrogant demand of a
           conqueror for a humiliating,
                          ABJECT -
                         
                          SEWARD
           You'll not be conquered people, Mr.
           Hunter. You will be citizens,
           returned to the laws and the
           guarantees of rights of the
           Constitution.
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           Which now extinguishes slavery. And
           with it our economy. All our laws
           will be determined by a Congress of
           vengeful Yankees, all our rights'll
           be subject to a Supreme Court
           benched by Black Republican
           radicals. All our traditions will
           be obliterated. We won't know
           ourselves anymore.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           (a nod, then:)
           We ain't here to discuss
           reconstruction, we have no legal
           basis for that discussion. But I
           don't want to deal falsely. The
           Northern states'll ratify, most of
           `em. As I figure, it remains for
           two of the Southern states to do
           the same, even after all are
           readmitted. And I been working on
           that.

           Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be
           ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done.
                         
          Hunter storms out of the cabin.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           If we submit ourselves to law,
           Alex, even submit to losing
           freedoms - the freedom to oppress,
           for instance - we may discover
           other freedoms previously unknown
           to us. Had you kept faith with
           democratic process, as frustrating
           as that can be -
           118.
                         
                         
           JOHN A. CAMPBELL
           Come sir, spare us at least these
           pieties. Did you defeat us with
           ballots?
                         
                          ALEXANDER STEPHENS
           How've you held your Union
           together? Through democracy? How
           many hundreds of thousands have
           died during your administration?
           Your Union, sir, is bonded in
           cannonfire and death.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           It may be you're right. But say all
           we done is show the world that
           democracy isn't chaos, that there
           is a great invisible strength in a
           people's union? Say we've shown
           that a people can endure awful
           sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't
           that save at least the idea of
           democracy, to aspire to?
           Eventually, to become worthy of? At
           all rates, whatever may be proven
           by blood and sacrifice must've been
           proved by now. Shall we stop this
           bleeding?
                         
                         
          EXT. A CITY ON A SOUTHERN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Like a vision of apocalypse, a city on the banks of a broad
          river is being consumed in a hellish fire, as artillery
          shells rend the dark sky asunder, raining down destruction.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIEGE LINES BEFORE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA - MORNING
                         
          The morning is grey, and a dense fog covers a vast field.
          Lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a
          horse on a rise at one end of the field. Behind him, several
          UNION OFFICERS are also mounted. It's chilly; the breath of
          the men and the horses is visible.
                         
          TITLE: OUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA
                         
                          APRIL 3
                         
          Lincoln flicks the reins of his horse, which starts down the
          slope. The officers follow behind him. No one speaks.
           119.
                         
                         
          Lincoln rides slowly, his focus on the ground before him.
          Debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of
          fallen soldiers.
                         
          He looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has
          concluded a couple of hours ago.
                         
          Looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by
          artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless,
          limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred
          too badly to tell. He sees soldiers killed by rifle and
          bayonet, whose corpses are intact.
                         
          At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in
          Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled
          as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final,
          successful drive to break through Confederate lines.
                         
          As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey
          and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle.
                         
          He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate
          flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY
          HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING
                         
          Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is
          sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln,
          in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they
          move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his
          eyes.
                         
          He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed
          with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused
          with grey. His brow has grown smoother.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Once he surrenders, send his boys
           back to their homes, their farms,
           their shops.
                         
                          GRANT
           Yes sir, as we discussed.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Liberality all around. No
           punishment. I don't want that. And
           the leaders - Jeff and the rest of
           `em - if they escape, leave the
           country while my back's turned,
           that wouldn't upset me none.
           120.
                         
                         
           When peace comes it mustn't just be
           hangings.
                         
                          GRANT
           By outward appearance, you're ten
           years older than you were a year
           ago.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Some weariness has bit at my bones.
                          (BEAT)
           I never seen the like of it before.
           What I seen today. Never seen the
           like of it before.
                         
                          GRANT
           You always knew that, what this was
           going to be. Intimate, and ugly.
           You must've needed to see it close
           when you decided to come down here.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We've made it possible for one
           another to do terrible things.
                         
                          GRANT
           And we've won the war. Now you have
           to lead us out of it.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA -
                         AFTERNOON
                         
          OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
          the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's
          just happened. No one is speaking.
                         
          TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA
                         
           APRIL 9, 1865
                         
          ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
          CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
          blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.
                         
          Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
          but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
          Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
          pride, defiance, blankness.
                         
          Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
          staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.
           121.
                         
                         
          Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
          Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
          two men who look awkwardly at one another.
                         
          Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
          for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
          Army remove their hats.
                         
          Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
          his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
          slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.
                         
                         
          EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON
                         
          A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in
          the buggy, driven by the old soldier.
                         
                          MARY
           You've an itch to travel?
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I'd like that. To the West by rail.
                         
                          MARY
           (shaking her head no:)
           Overseas.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           The Holy Land.
                         
                          MARY
           (a laugh, then:)
           Awfully pious for a man who takes
           his wife out buggy-riding on Good
           Friday.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon
           walked. I dream of walking in that
           ancient city.
                         
          She seems sadder. They ride in silence.
                         
                          MARY
           All anyone will remember of me is I
           was crazy and I ruined your
           happiness.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Anyone thinks that doesn't
           understand, Molly.
                         
          She nods; then, tenderly:
           122.
                         
                         
                          MARY
           When they look at you, at what it
           cost to live at the heart of this,
           they'll wonder at it. They'll
           wonder at you. They should. But
           they should also look at the
           wretched woman by your side, if
           they want to understand what this
           was truly like. For an ordinary
           person. For anyone other than you.
                         
          Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           We must try to be happier. We
           must. Both of us. We've been so
           miserable for so long.
                         
                         
          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - EVENING
                         
          Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening
          wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William
          Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and
          Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch
          whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the
          stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.
                         
          John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily
          marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops
          these on the floor. As they watch Hay:
                         
                          LINCOLN
           I did say some colored men, the
           intelligent, the educated, and
           veterans, I qualified it.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to
           know why you qualified it -
                         
                          SCHUYLER COLFAX
           No one heard the intelligent or the
           educated part. All they heard was
           the first time any president has
           ever made mention of Negro voting.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a
           better speech.
                         
                          JAMES ASHLEY
           Mr. Stevens also wants to know why
           you didn't make a better speech.
           123.
                         
                         
          They laugh. There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters.
                         
                          JOHN NICOLAY
                          (TO LINCOLN:)
           Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the
           carriage. She wants me to remind
           you of the hour, and that you'll
           have to pick up Miss Harris and
           Major Rathbone.
                         
          Lincoln nods. Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and
          gloves. Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Am I in trouble?
                         
                          WILLIAM SLADE
           No, sir.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Thank you, Mr. Slade.
                         
          Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain
          their drinks and rise.
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           I suppose it's time to go, though I
           would rather stay.
                         
          He leaves the room.
                         
                         
          INT. AN EMPTY CORRIDOR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE -
                         CONTINUOUS
                         
          On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table.
          Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then
          thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then
          some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.
          Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down
          the empty hallway.
                         
          Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone.
                         
                         
          INT. A THEATER - NIGHT
                         
          The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting.
                         
          Onstage, a Caliph's palace. A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars
          against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers
          in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed,
          then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon
          screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a
           124.
                         
                         
          flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's
          heart.
                         
          The audience applauds. In the center box, Tad Lincoln is
          joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel.
                         
          Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the
          young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain
          lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies,
          the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of
          the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and
          walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.
                         
          In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on
          the stage, eyes open, alarmed.
                         
          The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of
          concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands.
                         
                          LEONARD GROVER
                          (VOICE SHAKING:)
           The President has been shot.
                         
          There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap
          from their seats.
                         
           LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D)
           The President has been shot at
           Ford's Theater!
                         
          The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium. People cry,
          jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats,
          shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible
          in the uproar.
                         
          Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close
          to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the
          railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose. Tad can't
          stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing.
                         
                         
          INT. THE BEDROOM IN PETERSON'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. A small, hissing
          gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light.
                         
          Stanton, Speed, GENERAL HENRY HALLECK and a MINISTER, are
          standing. Welles sits by the head of the bed. DR. CHARLES
          LEALE, a young army surgeon, and DR. ROBERT STONE, the
          Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the
          bed, while DR. JOSEPH BARNES, the Surgeon General, listens to
          Lincoln's faint breathing.
           125.
                         
                         
          Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the
          bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing.
                         
          Lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed
          he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt.
                         
          Barnes moves his head closer, then closer. The room is
          utterly still. Barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time,
          softly clears his throat.
                         
           DR. BARNES
           It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday
           the 15th of April. It's all over.
           The President is no more.
                         
          No one talks, or moves.
                         
          Stanton looks at Lincoln's body.
                         
                          STANTON
           Now he belongs to the ages.
                         
          Robert begins to weep.
                         
           LINCOLN (V.O.)
           Fondly do we hope, fervently do we
           pray, that this mighty scourge of
           war may speedily pass away.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE EAST PORTICO OF THE CAPITOL - NOON
                         
          Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the
          Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies. He
          reads from the two pages.
                         
                          LINCOLN
           Yet, if God wills that it continue
           until all the wealth piled by the
           bondman's two hundred and fifty
           years of unrequited toil shall be
           sunk, and until every drop of blood
           drawn with the lash shall be paid
           by another drawn with the sword, as
           was said three thousand years ago,
           so still it must be said "the
           judgments of the Lord are true and
           righteous altogether."
                         
          He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the
          country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the
          first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of
          African Americans, civilians and soldiers.
           126.
                         
                         
                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)
           With malice toward none, with
           charity for all, with firmness in
           the right as God gives us to see
           the right, let us strive on to
           finish the work we are in, to bind
           up the nation's wounds, to care for
           him who shall have borne the
           battle, and for his widow and his
           orphan, to do all which may achieve
           and cherish a just and a lasting
           peace among ourselves and with all
           nations.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         THE END
