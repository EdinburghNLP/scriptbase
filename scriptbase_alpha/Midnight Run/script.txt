Midnight Run (1988) movie scriptby George Gallo.Shooting draft.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


The screen is BLACK. TRAFFIC HUMS on the SOUNDTRACK. MUSIC 
KICKS IN.

FADE IN:

The CREDIT SEQUENCE starts.

EXT. AVALON STREET - WATTS, CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

An Olds creeps slowly along the street. BADASSES loiter. 
Pass before the headlights. A fight is in progress out front 
of a topless bar. Punches are thrown. STRAGGLERS laugh at 
the mayhem.

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

This street is DEAD SILENT. The sidewalk is empty. A junkyard 
dog trots by on his nightly rounds. The Olds pulls into a 
spot at the curb. Tires CRACKLE over broken glass. The car 
engine DIES.

INT. OLDS - NIGHT

The driver taps a Camel cigarette. Raises it to his lips. 
Lights it with his Zippo. The flame reveals the face of JACK 
WALSH. Strong. Haggard. A killer stare. Pressure-cooker of a 
man. Always about to explode. The flame dances. Blue smoke 
swirls. The flame fades.

Walsh smokes his cigarette and stares at a four-story slum 
across the street. He glances at his watch. It's an old and 
battered Timex. It's been with Walsh for many years.

He checks his .45. It's loaded. Slips it back into his 
shoulder holster. Opens the door. Gets out.

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Walsh raises his collar against the Santa Ana wind and trots 
toward the slum.

INT. HALLWAY OF SLUM - NIGHT

Walsh enters. Eyes darting. Quietly moves up the first flight 
of stairs. The joint is SILENT.

INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Walsh turns the corner and moves up the stairs of the second 
floor. Catches a liquor bottle with his foot. BOUNCE. CLANK. 
CRASH. Walsh grimaces. A dog BARKS from a first-floor 
apartment. Cursing, Walsh moves for the third floor.

INT. THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT

Walsh hits the top step. Squints. Finds apartment 3C. 
Approaches. Stops. Puts his ear to the door. Removes a lock 
pick. Crouches. Slips it in. Jiggles it quietly. Drops it. 
Walsh bends over to retrieve the lock pick, when SUDDENLY:

BLAMMM!!! A shotgun UNLOADS from the other side of the door. 
Wood chunks fly. A gaping hole appears in the door right 
where Walsh's head was a moment before. Walsh bounces on his 
ass. Curses. Gets up. Pulls out his .45. Doesn't need to 
open the door to see into the apartment. Twenty-two-year-old 
MONROE BOUCHET climbs out of his window into the night. 
Clanging down the fire escape. Walsh runs down the stairs.

INT. BOUCHET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Walsh runs through the apartment to the window. Looks out. 
Sees Bouchet making his way up the fire escape. He goes out 
after him.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Bouchet makes his way up to the roof and starts running. The 
lights of downtown L.A. sparkle in the distance. Walsh hoists 
himself up to the roof, pursuing the fleeing Bouchet. Bouchet 
leaps from his building over to the next. Walsh, hot on his 
trail, does the same thing. Bouchet vaults over another alley 
to a third building. Ditto Walsh. Amazed that Walsh is still 
on his tail, Bouchet makes his most daring jump yet. He lands 
with a tumble, scoops up his shotgun and keeps moving. Without 
missing a beat, Walsh makes the leap and MISSES! He grabs at 
the ledge with his armpits. He slides slowly, grabbing for 
dear life as the old ledge cracks. It's a four-story drop. 
Some debris falls away. Walsh manages to pull himself back 
onto the roof. Winded, he spots Bouchet going down a fire 
escape at the far end of the building. Walsh is up and after 
him.

EXT. BOUCHET'S BUILDING - NIGHT

As Walsh appears at the rooftop, Bouchet opens FIRE. Walsh 
ducks. Bouchet continues down the metal staircase. Walsh 
clangs down after him. Bouchet hits the ground and runs into 
an alley. Walsh drops to the concrete in pursuit. As he turns 
into the alley, Bouchet fires again. Garbage cans EXPLODE. 
HEADLIGHTS of a car turn into the far end of the alley, aiming 
at Bouchet. Bouchet tries to avoid the car. Can't. He gets 
side-swiped. Growls with pain when he lands. The car SKIDS 
to a stop. From it emerges MARVIN DORFLER. If Walsh is the 
"Avis" of bounty hunters, Dorfler is the "Rent-a-Wreck." He 
makes up for his deficiencies with force. He's loaded with 
dim, impulsive behavior. Walsh approaches. He and Dorfler 
lock eyes. They know each other well. Too well.

               WALSH
     What the hell are you doin', Dorfler?

               DORFLER
     He's mine, Jack. Get lost.

               WALSH
     Fuck you, he's yours. He's mine. 
     Moscone assigned this guy to me.

Dorfler places his foot on Bouchet's chest. Bouchet still 
MOANS.

               DORFLER
     Well, go straighten it out with 
     Moscone. I'll collect the money.

               WALSH
          (Closer)
     Goddamn you, Dorfler. I nearly got 
     killed tryin' to get him!

Dorfler WHIPS out a .45. Points it at Walsh.

               DORFLER
     Back off, Walsh. I said I'm takin' 
     him.

Walsh stops. Smiles. Ear to ear.

               WALSH
     Marvin. Why are we fightin'? You and 
     me are friends.

               DORFLER
     This clown's worth fifteen hundred, 
     Jack. It's nothin' personal. Now get 
     lost.

               WALSH
     Alright, alright.

Suddenly Walsh points over Dorfler's shoulder.

               WALSH
     Marvin! Watch out!

Walsh decks Marvin.

               BOUCHET
          (Still dazed)
     What the fuck's goin' on? You guys 
     ain't cops.

               WALSH
     No, we're musicians. Get in the car.

Walsh gets inside Marvin's car and takes off with Bouchet.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Walsh drives down the street, slowing Dorfler's car outside 
of the L.A. County Jail parking lot. He pulls in. Partway.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - NIGHT

Bouchet looks at Walsh.

               WALSH
     Open your door.

Bouchet, confused, opens the car door. Walsh does the same 
with his car door. Then he BACKS UP quickly.

EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Both doors are RIPPED off the car by the two pillars at the 
entrance. Then Walsh swings Dorfler's car into the parking 
lot through the exit. The tires EXPLODE as Walsh proceeds 
the wrong way over the metal teeth that block incoming 
traffic. Walsh keeps moving and SLAMS into a brick wall, 
CRUNCHING the front end. Then Walsh puts it in reverse and 
ROARS into the parking spot he targets, CRUNCHING the rear 
end of the car against another brick wall.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - NIGHT

Walsh looks at Bouchet.

               WALSH
     We get out here.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

A few PRISONERS mill about with their lawyers. A JANITOR 
mops the floor. Handcuffed to Walsh, Bouchet almost starts 
to cry.

               BOUCHET
     All I did was come home and he was 
     sleepin' with my old lady. And I 
     shot him. Then I heard on the TV 
     that the dude was "lucid." I didn't 
     do that to him. I swear.

Walsh looks at Bouchet. Feels sorry for him.

               WALSH
     "Lucid" means he was coherent. Makin' 
     sense when he talked.

               BOUCHET
     Shit. He wasn't "lucid" before I 
     shot him.

Behind the window, a cop named GOOCH.

               WALSH
     Hey, Gooch, I've got a delivery.
          (Sliding papers)
     Monroe Bouchet.

               GOOCH
     Give you any trouble?

               WALSH
     Nah, he was real cooperative. A 
     regular charm.

Bouchet thanks Walsh with his eyes as a GUARD takes him away. 
Gooch hands Walsh a booking slip.

               WALSH
     Take care of yourself, Monroe.

               BOUCHET
     You too.

EXT. VIGNES STREET - DAWN

Walsh leaves the L.A. County Jail. The street glows with 
early blue of dawn. Across the way, there's a carnival of 
bail bond offices. All with lights. Inviting signs. Walsh 
heads for the sideshow.

INT. JOE MOSCONE'S BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAWN

Second floor. Huge glass doors. Three desks. Fourteen tons 
of paper. A thirty-year-old weasel of an assistant, JERRY 
GEISLER, reads a newspaper. He sucks toothpicks for a living. 
Walsh enters.

               WALSH
     Is Moscone in? I just dropped off 
     Bouchet.

               JERRY
     You finally caught somebody, Jack?

               WALSH
     Jerry, is he in?

Jerry flips through the Los Angeles Times.

               JERRY
     It says here that eleven percent of 
     people, in the course of dreaming, 
     are aware of that fact while they're 
     in the dream state.

Walsh has no patience for Jerry.

               WALSH
     Where is he, Jerry?

               JERRY
     That ever happen to you, Jack?

JOE MOSCONE exits his cubicle. He's a man on edge at all 
times. Juggling cash and clients and a thousand lies at once. 
He is slipping into a cheap sports jacket.

               MOSCONE
     Hey, Jerry, this ain't a library.

Walsh hands Moscone the booking slip. He glances at it.

               MOSCONE
     Bouchet was twelve hundred, right?

               WALSH
     No, fifteen.

               MOSCONE
     Oh, yeah, right. I was just going 
     over to Denny's to catch the "grand 
     slam breakfast." They start serving 
     at six-thirty.

               WALSH
     Do you have my fifteen hundred?

               MOSCONE
     Of course. Did you think I was gonna 
     stiff you?

               WALSH
     You? Never.

               MOSCONE
     Jack, you really are the best at 
     what you do. Let me buy you some 
     breakfast.

               WALSH
     I don't eat breakfast.

               MOSCONE
     Then have an early lunch. Hey, Jerry. 
     Watch the phones.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - EARLY MORNING

Walsh and Moscone move down the street, heading for Denny's.

               WALSH
     You'll never guess who I ran into 
     while I was taking in Mr. Bouchet.

               MOSCONE
     Who's that?

               WALSH
     Marvin Dorfler.

               MOSCONE
     No. Funny how that guy keeps poppin' 
     up.

               WALSH
     Hysterical.

               MOSCONE
     Jack, I'm not gonna bullshit you. I 
     got a little problem right now.

               WALSH
     Hey, can we stop and buy a copy of 
     Playboy, because when I'm being jerked 
     off, I like to look at something.

               MOSCONE
     What are you talkin' about?

               WALSH
     I've been through this. You're about 
     to tell me you don't have my fifteen 
     hundred.

               MOSCONE
     Jack, I've got something better than 
     fifteen hundred.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - MORNING

A typical Denny's interior. Walsh and Moscone sit at a table. 
Walsh sips coffee and watches Moscone wolf down his "grand 
slam breakfast."

               MOSCONE
     Do you know who Jonathan Mardukas 
     is?

               WALSH
     The Duke? Yeah, I know who he is.

               MOSCONE
     What do you know?

Walsh taps a Camel. Lights it.

               WALSH
     He's that accountant that embezzled 
     a couple million from some Vegas 
     wise guy and gave it to charity.

               MOSCONE
     That's pretty good, only it wasn't a 
     "couple of million," it was fifteen 
     million and it wasn't just "some 
     Vegas wise guy," it was Jimmy Serrano.

               WALSH
     Yeah, I can read a newspaper.

               MOSCONE
     Well, I don't want to bring up the 
     past, but isn't Serrano the guy that 
     ran you out of Chicago when he was 
     running things there years back?

Walsh tenses up.

               WALSH
     He didn't run me out.

               MOSCONE
     Sure. You left being a cop to do 
     this shit.

               WALSH
     What's the point?

               MOSCONE
     The point, Jack, is twenty-five 
     thousand bucks. I bailed the 
     accountant out. Only, I didn't know 
     who he was at the time. If I knew, I 
     never would of put up the bond. I 
     mean it would only be a matter of 
     time before Serrano vanished him 
     from the planet and I'm out my four 
     hundred and fifty grand.

               WALSH
     You're out four hundred and fifty 
     grand on this guy?

               MOSCONE
     No.

               WALSH
     No?

               MOSCONE
     No. Because I've got you. And you're 
     gonna go find him and bring him back.

               WALSH
     Right. How do you even know he's 
     still alive?

               MOSCONE
     Because he sends Jimmy Serrano 
     postcards from everywhere, telling 
     him what a great time he's having 
     with his money.

Walsh can't help but smile.

               WALSH
     How much time you have left?

               MOSCONE
          (Sick again)
     Friday midnight I default and have 
     to eat the four-fifty.

               WALSH
     That's five days. Forget it. You go 
     find him.

               MOSCONE
     Jack, hear me out. I'll give you 
     fifty thousand. I'm in jam city.

               WALSH
     I've got to chase you down just to 
     collect fifteen hundred. No dice.

               MOSCONE
     Jack...

               WALSH
     Jack, nothin'. What else have you 
     got?

               MOSCONE
     If you don't get this guy, I might 
     be out of business. I can't absorb 
     this kind of loss.

               WALSH
     I'll do it for a hundred grand.

               MOSCONE
     A hundred grand! Are you out of your 
     mind? Jack, this is an easy gig. 
     It's a midnight run, for Christ sakes.

Walsh gets up.

               MOSCONE
     C'mon Jack, sit down.

               WALSH
     If you want me for a job this big, 
     you pay me what's right. Maybe you 
     haven't noticed but I'm tired of 
     getting shot at.

               MOSCONE
     This guy's an accountant! He's not 
     going to shoot you. Just put a bag 
     over his head, hit him with a rubber 
     hose and stick him on an airplane.

               WALSH
     I'll do it for a hundred grand and 
     then I'm out of this business forever. 
     And I want a contract. I want it in 
     writing. A hundred grand, and I'll 
     have the Duke here by Friday night.

Walsh sees that Moscone is about to give in.

               WALSH
     Now, do you think I could have my 
     fifteen hundred?

Moscone starts reaching for his pocket.

INT. RAMPART DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Walsh moves through the homicide division with DETECTIVE 
DAVE HAMMOND. Other DETECTIVES sit at their desks. Phones 
RING. The joint is JUMPING as usual.

               HAMMOND
     I was just saying to myself that 
     this has been the worst day in memory. 
     All I need is Jack Walsh to appear, 
     and look what blows in.

               WALSH
     Dave, look, I need a favor.

               HAMMOND
     What do you need? A case of Jack 
     Daniels?

               WALSH
     The booking slip for a guy named 
     Jonathan Mardukas.

               HAMMOND
     I'll get you a copy.

               WALSH
     No, Dave. I need to see the original.

               HAMMOND
     Copies were good enough for the FBI.

               WALSH
     They're looking for him, too?

               HAMMOND
     The guy's wanted in seven states.

INT. FILE DEPARTMENT - DAY

A dark cavern filled with file cabinets. Hammond pulls the 
police booking slip and hands it to Walsh. Walsh glances at 
the front. He crosses his fingers, takes a hopeful breath 
and turns it over. Scribbled on the back is a telephone number 
with a 212 area code. Walsh smiles.

               HAMMOND
     What did you find?

               WALSH
     The number Mardukas called after he 
     was arrested.

Walsh starts to copy it down.

               WALSH
     Two-one-two. Looks like I'm going to 
     New York.

EXT. BEVERLY BOULEVARD - DAY

Walsh exits Rampart Division Police Station. A very large 
black man -- with steel-rimmed sunglasses, dressed in a 
sharply pressed navy-blue suit -- stands alongside a car. 
His name is ALONZO MOSELY. As Walsh walks down the street, 
Mosely blocks his way. They lock eyes.

               WALSH
     Excuse me.

               MOSELY
     Are you Jack Walsh?

Walsh senses trouble.

               WALSH
     Do I know you?

Mosely starts to reach for his identification. Before he can 
get it out, Walsh starts to walk. Mosely moves to block him.

               WALSH
     Hey, get the fuck outta my way.

Walsh shoves Mosely back. A SCUFFLE ensues. SUDDENLY from 
out of nowhere, three men in suits appear. They surround 
Walsh. Shove him through the crowds and into a green Plymouth.

INT. PLYMOUTH - DAY

One of the men slides in behind the wheel. Mosely gets in 
the front. Walsh is wedged in the backseat between two men. 
Each of them wears sunglasses. Walsh sits in the silence as 
the four men stare him down through their dark green lenses.

               MOSELY
     Inspector Mosely, Federal Bureau of 
     Investigation.

               WALSH
     Did you know there's a ten-dollar 
     fine for jaywalking in Los Angeles?

No response. The other men are AGENTS PERRY, TUTTLE and 
PLUMIDES.

               MOSELY
     Are you working on anything having 
     to do with Jonathan Mardukas?

               WALSH
     Who's that?

               MOSELY
     The Duke.

               WALSH
     Never heard of him.

               MOSELY
     I think you have heard of him.

Walsh slowly reaches into his breast pocket and puts on his 
own sunglasses. He smiles back at the group and then Mosely. 
Now everyone's wearing sunglasses.

               MOSELY
     Let me tell you something, asshole. 
     I've been working six years trying 
     to bring down Jimmy Serrano and 
     Mardukas is my shot. I want to take 
     him into Federal Court.

Without missing a beat, Mosely reaches over and whips off 
Walsh's sunglasses.

               MOSELY
     So I don't want to see some third-
     rate rent-a-thug who couldn't cut it 
     as a cop in Chicago bring him into 
     L.A. for some bullshit local charge. 
     Do I make myself understood?

               WALSH
     Let me ask you somethin'. Those 
     sunglasses. Are those government-
     issued or do all you guys go to the 
     same store to get them?

               MOSELY
     You can go now.

Plumides opens the door.

               WALSH
     Have a nice day.

EXT. BEVERLY BOULEVARD - DAY

Walsh gets out. Plumides shuts the door. The car STARTS up.

               WALSH
     Do you think I could have my 
     sunglasses back?

As the car begins to ROAR off, Mosely tosses Walsh's 
sunglasses out. Walsh catches them. He watches the car 
disappear. Then he turns. Squints. Spots a wallet on the 
sidewalk. Picks it up and opens it. It's Mosely's FBI 
identification. Walsh smiles.

INT. 747 - NIGHT

Walsh hums a tune while he inserts his photo over Mosely's 
FBI identification. A CHILD sits next to him watching. Walsh 
smiles at the kid and then flashes his badge.

               WALSH
     Mosely, FBI.

The kid looks scared.

               WALSH
     Just kidding.

EXT. RUNWAY J.F.K. AIRPORT, NEW YORK - MORNING

The 747 THUNDERS down in the rain.

INT. J.F.K. AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING

Long faces march off the red-eye. Walsh moves with purpose 
over to a pay phone. Looks through his black book. Dials.

               WALSH
          (Into phone)
     Harold Longman, please.
          (A beat)
     Harry. Jack Walsh. Did ya get me 
     that address check on that phone 
     number?
          (Starts scribbling)
     I've got it. Thanks, Harry. Say hello 
     to Julie for me.

Walsh hangs up.

INT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL OFFICE - MORNING

Walsh completes filling out a rental form and hands it over 
to an EMPLOYEE.

DARUVO

Large. Somewhere between muscular and overweight approaches 
with JOEY RIBUFFO. Tall and thin, a New York Post under his 
arm.

               DARUVO
     You Jack Walsh?

               WALSH
     Who wants to know?

               JOEY
     That's a yes.

Joey's got a staring problem. He can't take his eyes off of 
Walsh's coat.

               DARUVO
     We'd really like to have a word with 
     you.

               WALSH
     What about?

               JOEY
     It involves big cash and lots of 
     prizes.

Walsh lights a Camel. Joey stares at that, too.

               DARUVO
     I'll make it short and sweet. The 
     people I work for are very interested 
     in your visit here.

               WALSH
     Oh yeah? Who are the people you work 
     for?

               DARUVO
     An old friend of yours from the 
     Chicago days.

Walsh turns, locks eyes with Joey's stare.

               WALSH
     How are ya?

               DARUVO
     You're here for the Duke. You think 
     he's in New York. We think you're 
     right.

               JOEY
     Where'd you get that coat? Is that a 
     London Fog?

               WALSH
     What the hell are you talkin' about?

               DARUVO
     Never mind him.
          (Beat)
     The way I hear it, you didn't 
     cooperate with my boss a few years 
     back.

Walsh takes a thoughtful drag on his Camel. Thinks. Joey's 
attention shifts to Walsh's cigarette.

               JOEY
     You smoke Camels?
          (A beat, smiling)
     I smoke Kools.

The importance of this statement is known only to Joey. A 
poker-faced Walsh looks at him uncomprehendingly.

               DARUVO
     My boss would pay you a hell of a 
     lot more for the Duke than that putz 
     bail bondsman in L.A.

               WALSH
     How much more?

               DARUVO
     How about a one with six zeros?

Walsh feels the heat of Joey's stare. Walsh turns.

               WALSH
     Are you gonna propose?

               JOEY
     Propose?

               WALSH
     'Cause if you ain't, quit fuckin' 
     starin' at me.

               DARUVO
     Yeah, Joey. Back off, for Christ 
     sakes.

Joey steps back. The Employee reappears with the contract 
and keys.

               EMPLOYEE
     Here are your keys, sir. Just exit 
     through the glass doors. The parking 
     lot is to your left.

Walsh takes the keys. Tony has scribbled down his number on 
the back of a card. He puts it in Walsh's pocket.

               DARUVO
     Ask for Tony Daruvo. That's me. 
     They'll put you through to wherever 
     I am
          (Beat)
     Be good to yourself, this time.

Walsh heads out through the glass doors.

EXT. QUEENS STREET - DAY

Walsh cruises along in his rented Pontiac approaching the 
bridge leading into Manhattan.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - DAY

As he drives, he suddenly notices that he's being tailed by 
Tony and Joey in a Lincoln. After a few moments of thinking, 
he GUNS the car hard.

EXT. QUEENS STREET - DAY

Walsh gets the jump on Tony and Joey. They TEAR off in 
pursuit.

INT. LINCOLN - DAY

As Tony and Joey try to keep up with him. Several trucks 
impair their view. Walsh disappears around a corner.

               JOEY
     I think he's onto us.

               DARUVO
     Figured that out, did ya?

EXT. QUEENS PONTIAC DEALERSHIP - DAY

Tony and Joey cruise by the dozens of parked Pontiacs. When 
they are out of sight, one of them starts up and moves off 
in the opposite direction with Walsh behind the wheel.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - DAY

Walsh grins as he watches the Lincoln disappear in his 
rearview mirror.

EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET - DAY

The CAMERA FOLLOWS a wire from a telephone junction box, 
mounted on the side of a brownstone. It leads into the 
passenger window of Walsh's car where it is attached to a 
small cassette recorder. A taxi rounds the corner and pulls 
up to the brownstone that Walsh is staking.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - DAY

Walsh licks his fingers. Finishing off his lunch of jelly 
donuts, he eyeballs the older couple that exits the cab. 
They enter the brownstone. Walsh hits the "record" button on 
the recorder and gets out of his car.

EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET - DAY

He trots up to a phone booth on the corner and dials.

               WALSH
          (Into phone)
     Mrs. Nelson?

               MRS. NELSON (V.O.)
     Yes?

               WALSH
     Alonzo Mosely, FBI. How are you this 
     afternoon?

No response.

               WALSH
     Let me get right to the point, if I 
     may, Mrs. Nelson. An agent in our 
     Los Angeles office discovered a detail 
     that somehow was overlooked until 
     now. It seems that when Jonathan 
     Mardukas was arrested, you were the 
     first person he called. Isn't that 
     correct, Mrs. Nelson?

Still no response.

               WALSH
     Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?

               MRS. NELSON (V.O.)
          (Weakly)
     Yes.

               WALSH
     Needless to say, this is a matter of 
     great concern to us. If it wouldn't 
     be too much trouble, I would like 
     you to come down to 26 Federal Plaza 
     tomorrow at nine o'clock and ask for 
     Agent Mosely. Do you think you could 
     do that, please?

               MRS. NELSON (V.O.)
     I suppose so.

               WALSH
     Thank you for your cooperation. Good 
     afternoon, Mrs. Nelson.

He hangs up and runs back to his car.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - DAY

As he gets in, he hears TOUCH-TONE BEEPS through the cassette 
recorder's speaker. Mrs. Nelson is making a call. Walsh has 
tapped the line.

               MRS. NELSON (V.O.)
     Dana? Helen. The FBI just called. 
     They want to speak to me about 
     Jonathan.

Walsh LISTENS. Then he HEARS a male voice. It's THE DUKE 
himself.

Walsh hangs on every word.

               THE DUKE (V.O.)
     Helen? What's going on?

               MRS. NELSON (V.O.)
     Jonathan, the FBI just called. They 
     know we spoke the night you were 
     arrested.

               THE DUKE (V.O.)
     Hang up the phone, Helen. Right now!

CLICK. DIAL TONE. Walsh hits the rewind on the cassette 
recorder. Replays the touch-tone beeps. Smiling, he GUNS the 
car away.

EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS STREET - NIGHT

Manhattan looms across the East River. As Walsh's car glides 
down the street, he notices a woman placing a suitcase in 
the trunk of a car. She heads back into her house, leaving 
the door ajar. Walsh checks the address of the house. Stops. 
Gets out. Sneaks toward the front porch.

EXT. MARDUKAS HOME - NIGHT

Walsh stops at the front door. Removes his .45. Listens. He 
pushes his way inside quietly.

INT. MARDUKAS HOME - NIGHT

Downstairs is dark. Walsh creeps across the living room. 
HEARS MOVEMENT going on upstairs. Walsh inches for the stairs, 
moving up them SILENTLY. Walsh is not alone. A pair of eyes 
watch him. A shadow moves across the wall. A huge German 
shepherd follows him across the living room floor.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Walsh craftily moves up the steps with his back to the wall. 
Walsh may be stalking the Duke, but the huge shepherd is 
stalking Walsh as well. Walsh disappears around the corner 
to the upstairs hall. The shepherd follows its prey.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

.45 at the ready, Walsh approaches the bedroom. Walsh is 
beginning to sweat. About to make his move. He turns. Locks 
eyes with the shepherd. Walsh's eyes bulge. The shepherd 
bares its teeth. Begins a low guttural GROWL. Walsh tries to 
stand his ground with an intimidating stare, but this is one 
contest that he won't win. He reaches for the doorknob behind 
him. Opens it. Bolts inside. The shepherd lunges against the 
closing door, barking wildly. JONATHAN MARDUKAS, the Duke, 
appears from the bedroom. DANA MARDUKAS, his wife, follows. 
The Duke appears almost bookish. Yet, there is an enigmatic 
quality about him. A man with many facets which are not 
apparent at first glance.

               THE DUKE
     What is it, Heidi?

Heidi throws herself at the bathroom door.

               DANA
     What is it, John?

               THE DUKE
     I don't know.

He reaches for the bathroom door. Opens it. Heidi bolts 
inside.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

It's instantaneous. The Duke and Dana enter. Heidi throws 
herself against the glass enclosed shower door. Walsh is on 
the other side. His FBI badge plastered against the glass 
door with one hand. The .45 pointed against the glass with 
the other.

               WALSH
     Alonzo Mosely, FBI! Get that fuckin' 
     dog outta here!

The Duke hesitates.

               WALSH
     Don't move! I'll drop you right 
     through the fuckin' glass!

               THE DUKE
          (To Dana)
     Do what he says. Get her out of here.

Dana grabs the BARKING dog. Drags her out of the bathroom. 
Walsh steps out of the shower. The Duke has his hands up.

               WALSH
     You're the Duke?

               THE DUKE
     That's right.

Walsh cuffs him.

EXT. MARDUKAS HOME - NIGHT

Walsh leads the Duke to the Pontiac. Dana follows along-side, 
panicked. Heidi BARKS from inside the house.

               DANA
     John. What do I do?

               THE DUKE
     Don't do anything, sweetheart, I'll 
     be alright.

               WALSH
     Yeah. He'll be fine.

Walsh shoves the Duke into the car.

               WALSH
     Nice watchdog.

               THE DUKE
     For five hundred dollars she should 
     have taken your head off.

Walsh climbs behind the wheel, swings a mad U-turn and tears 
away.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - NIGHT

They speed through the night.

               THE DUKE
     Congratulations.

               WALSH
     For what?

               THE DUKE
     You just did what no one else could 
     do. You found me.

               WALSH
     You got that right.

EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

Walsh GUNS the car onto the expressway, heading for J.F.K. 
Airport.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - NIGHT

The Duke looks behind him. Manhattan is in the distance. He 
turns. Airport signs are up ahead.

               THE DUKE
     You're taking me to the airport, 
     aren't you?

No answer. The Duke looks around the car with apprehension.

               THE DUKE
     You don't seem like an FBI agent to 
     me.

               WALSH
     Well, you don't seem much like a 
     "Duke" to me either.

               THE DUKE
     If you're an FBI agent, why don't 
     you just take me to the FBI office?

               WALSH
     If you don't be quiet, this is gonna 
     be the worst trip of your fuckin' 
     life.

               THE DUKE
     You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't 
     you?

               WALSH
     No, I don't work for that piece of 
     shit. Your bail bondsman hired me to 
     bring you back to L.A.

               THE DUKE
     I've got money, you know.

               WALSH
     I'm sure you do.

               THE DUKE
     I'll give you whatever you want.

               WALSH
     Start by shuttin' up.

Walsh slows the car as he takes an exit ramp. The Duke sizes 
up his situation. As Walsh turns the car to blend into the 
traffic of a busy street, the Duke opens the door and tries 
to jump. Walsh grimaces and reaches for him.

EXT. LONG ISLAND STREET - NIGHT

As Walsh tries to pull the Duke back inside, he almost loses 
control of the car. Nearby cars screech away to avoid him. 
Horns BLARE. Swerving hard, he just misses an eighteen-
wheeler.

INT. WALSH'S CAR - NIGHT

Walsh yanks the Duke back inside, slams the door and forces 
him to the floor. Cocks his .45 and levels it in the Duke's 
face.

               WALSH
     It is truly in your best interest 
     for you to just fuckin' relax.

               THE DUKE
     I'm relaxed. I'm totally relaxed.

EXT. AMERICAN AIRLINES TERMINAL - NIGHT

Walsh pulls up and SLAMS the brakes. They both get out. Walsh 
puts his .45 into his bag.

               WALSH
     I can't keep you cuffed on a 
     commercial flight and I gotta check 
     my gun in with the luggage. But, 
     fuck with me once, and I'll break 
     your neck.

               THE DUKE
     I can't fly.

               WALSH
     What?

               THE DUKE
     You heard me. I can't fly.

               WALSH
     You're gonna have to do better than 
     that.

               THE DUKE
     I don't have to do better than that 
     because that's the truth. I can't 
     fly. I suffer from aviophobia.

               WALSH
     What does that mean?

               THE DUKE
     It means I can't fly. I also suffer 
     from acrophobia and claustrophobia.

Walsh takes him firmly by the arm.

               WALSH
     When we get to L.A. you can tell the 
     prison psychiatrist all about it. 
     You fuck with me you'll suffer from 
     fist-O-phobia.

INT. AMERICAN AIRLINES TERMINAL - NIGHT

A row of pay phones. Walsh is on the phone. The Duke is cuffed 
to him. Walsh jabs a bunch of numbers.

               WALSH
          (Into phone)
     Jerry, give me Moscone.

               JERRY (V.O.)
     Hold on.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE Moscone picks up the phone. Jerry 
quietly listens in on the extension.

               MOSCONE
     Jack...

               WALSH
     I got him.

               MOSCONE
     Got who?

               WALSH
     The Duke. He's standing right here.

               MOSCONE
     You got him? Already?

               WALSH
     You wanna say hello?

Walsh yanks the Duke to the phone. Forces it to his face.

               WALSH
     Say hello to your bail bondsman, 
     Eddie Moscone.

               THE DUKE
          (Flatly)
     Hello.

Walsh yanks the phone back.

               WALSH
     There you go. Jonathan Mardukas in 
     the flesh.

               MOSCONE
     Where are you now?

EXT. VIGNES STREET - NIGHT

DEAD QUIET. The street is empty except for a van parked up 
the street from Moscone's.

               WALSH (V.O.)
     I found him in New York. We're at 
     J.F.K.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

TWO FEDERAL AGENTS have tapped into Moscone's phone lines. 
Both wear headphones. The van is filled with cables. Meters. 
Phone-tapping equipment.

               WALSH (V.O.)
     We're comin' in on Flight 97. American 
     Airlines. We'll be there at eleven, 
     your time.

Agent 1 scribbles down the information.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               MOSCONE
     I love you. Jack, goddamnit! I really 
     do!

               WALSH
     See you soon.

Moscone hangs up. Races out of his cubicle. Something is 
afoot with Jerry. He hangs up slowly.

               MOSCONE
     Walsh picked up the Duke.

               JERRY
     No kidding. That's great, Eddie. 
     Let's celebrate. Do you want some 
     donuts?

               MOSCONE
     Yeah. Run down to Winchell's and get 
     a dozen. And get me a few of those 
     apple fritters.

               JERRY
     You got it, Eddie.

Jerry grabs his jacket and moves out the door.

EXT. VIGNES STREET - NIGHT

Jerry zips up his jacket. Moves quickly toward the pay phone 
at the corner. Passes right by the FBI van.

ANGLE ON PHONE BOOTH Jerry grabs the receiver. Dials.

               JERRY
          (Into phone)
     Hello. This is Jerry Geisler. Can 
     you put me through to Tony Daruvo.

INT. BROOKLYN STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

Joey eats his dinner in the background. Still chewing his 
steak, Tony approaches the phone. He picks up the receiver.

               DARUVO
     Yeah.

INTERCUT TONY AND JERRY

               JERRY
     Tony, this is Jerry Geisler. How are 
     you?

               DARUVO
          (Still chewing)
     I'm eating dinner.

               JERRY
     I'm sorry to bother you, but Walsh 
     found the Duke and he's bringing him 
     in on American Airlines, Flight 97. 
     They'll be at L.A.X. at eleven 
     o'clock. Don't forget me, huh?

INT. STARLIGHT CASINO, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

PHIL, a pit boss, moves through the crowds and approaches 
the high-roller crap table. A man, who exudes importance, 
has his back to us. He's laughing with a group of VIP 
gamblers. Phil taps the man on the shoulder, who turns. It 
is JIMMY SERRANO. Two thousand dollar suit. You can take 
Jimmy out of the streets, but you can't take the streets out 
of Jimmy.

               PHIL
     Mr. Serrano?

Serrano turns. Phil leans in. WHISPERS.

               PHIL
     Daruvo called. Your friends are going 
     to be flying into L.A. at eleven 
     o'clock.

Serrano excuses himself from the group.

INT. L. A. FBI OFFICE - NIGHT

A long hallway. Mosely strides with determination. Steel-
rimmed sunglasses hanging from his breast pocket. In his 
wake, Perry, Tuttle and Plumides struggle to keep up. Tuttle 
just has to ask.

               TUTTLE
     How did Walsh find him so fast?

Plumides winces and gestures to Tuttle to keep quiet before 
further enraging Mosely. They all move for the door.

INT. 747 - NIGHT

Walsh and the Duke enter the first-class section. Walsh 
smiles, already spending his money. They are directed to 
their seats. Walsh eases back in his spacious seat. Stretching 
out, he takes full advantage of the legroom. The Duke, of 
course, sits next to him, looking nervous.

               WALSH
     First class is nice. I could make a 
     habit out of this. America. What a 
     country? Huh?

The STEWARDESS approaches.

               STEWARDESS
     Good evening, gentlemen.

               WALSH
     Good evening to you.

She hands them menus.

               STEWARDESS
     Would you gentlemen like something 
     to drink once we're in the air?

               WALSH
     We'd like your best champagne.

She leaves. Walsh enthusiastically studies the menu.

               WALSH
          (To the Duke)
     I'm gonna have the steak. How about 
     you, John?

               THE DUKE
     I'm not hungry.

               WALSH
     Well, then, get the lobster so I can 
     get a little surf-and-turf action 
     goin'.

Walsh happily straps himself in. The Duke is not doing well. 
Walsh straps the Duke in.

EXT. 747 - NIGHT

The jet pulls away from the jetway.

INT. 747 - NIGHT

The Duke is sweating.

               WALSH
     Enjoy the ride.

               THE DUKE
     I'm not going to make it.

The Duke grabs the STEWARDESS. Unstraps himself.

               THE DUKE
     I can't go through with this.

               STEWARDESS
     Sir, you'll have to sit down. We're 
     taxiing.

The ENGINES increase. ROAR. People turn. Start watching the 
unfolding scene.

               THE DUKE
     I will not sit down! This is MY LIFE!

Walsh gets up. Tries to calm the situation down.

               WALSH
     Stewardess, relax. This man's my 
     prisoner and I'm taking him back to 
     Los Angeles.

The Duke regresses. Sounds more and more like a child.

               THE DUKE
     I'm getting claustrophobic. I can't 
     take it. I've got this recurring 
     nightmare, where I feel as if I'm 
     losing control. And this feels the 
     same way.

               WALSH
     You're right. You're not in control. 
     I'm in control. Now sit down!

               THE DUKE
          (To Stewardess)
     How long is this flight?

               STEWARDESS
     We should be in Los Angeles in just 
     over five hours.

               THE DUKE
          (Losing it)
     Should? Should be in Los Angeles? 
     That means you're not sure! If you 
     were sure, you'd say we'd be in Los 
     Angeles in just over five hours.

The Stewardess backs away from the situation and moves up 
the aisle. She enters the cockpit.

               WALSH
          (Grabbing the Duke)
     Alright. Enough. Now sit down!

               THE DUKE
          (Having a tantrum)
     I'm in a casket and they've buried 
     me alive! I'm in a casket and they've 
     buried me alive! I can't get out! I 
     can't get out! I can't breathe!

The Duke breaks free. Turns.

               THE DUKE
     You can't do it. You can't make me 
     fly. I'll go back to Los Angeles 
     with you, but you can't make me fly!

EXT. 747 - NIGHT

The ENGINES DIE. The plane stops.

INT. 747 - NIGHT

The CAPTAIN appears from the cockpit moving down the aisle.

               CAPTAIN
     Alright, everyone. Just calm down.

               WALSH
          (Flashing badge)
     Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

               CAPTAIN
     You can't take a prisoner aboard an 
     airplane if he doesn't want to fly. 
     You should know that.

               WALSH
     I do. I'm sorry. I thought he was 
     bluffing. Let's forget the whole 
     thing.

               CAPTAIN
     I suggest you find some other mode 
     of transportation.

Walsh nods. Closes his eyes. Hates what's coming next.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

The P.A. system echoes forth departure times. COMMUTERS run 
for trains. Some BUMS hang out at a news-stand while others 
sleep on benches. Walsh strides through the crowd with the 
Duke in tow. He notices a slight smile on his face.

               WALSH
     What the fuck are you smiling at?

               THE DUKE
     I love to travel by train.

               WALSH
     What do you think this is, the class 
     trip?

               THE DUKE
     Are you always this angry?

               WALSH
     I'm in a great mood right now. You 
     wait until I've been cooped up on 
     this thing for awhile. You'll be 
     running for that jail cell.

INT. UNDERGROUND TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

Packed with PASSENGERS and PORTERS. The Lake Shore Limited 
is on the platform.

               THE DUKE
     Are you still going to make your 
     deadline, Jack?

               WALSH
     With fourteen hours to spare.

Walsh shoves the Duke onto the train.

INT. HALL OF SLEEPING CAR - NIGHT

Walsh and the Duke follow MILES, the porter. Walsh blocks 
Miles' view of the cuffs.

               MILES
          (With passenger list)
     You are?

               WALSH
     Jack Walsh.

               MILES
          (To the Duke)
     And?

               WALSH
     Guest.

               MILES
     This way, gentlemen.

INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Miles leads Walsh and the Duke to a small sleeping 
compartment. Two bunk beds. Miles leaves. Walsh unlocks his 
side of the handcuffs and opens the bathroom door.

               THE DUKE
     You know, Jack, it really shows me 
     that you're a quality human being 
     for not forcing me to fly against my 
     will.

Walsh cuffs the Duke to the handicap railing and SLAMS the 
bathroom door.

INT. UNDERGROUND TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

The Lake Shore Limited lurches to a start. Picking up speed, 
it begins its journey west.

INT. LOS ANGELES AMERICAN AIRLINES TERMINAL - NIGHT

As the PASSENGERS start to deplane, several HITMEN, scattered 
about the terminal, scan each face looking for the Duke. As 
the crowd grows thinner, they exchange puzzled glances. As 
it becomes apparent Walsh and the Duke are not on this plane, 
Mosely and his men appear, as if out of nowhere. Perry flashes 
his I.D. at the Flight Attendant as the Agents board. The 
Hitmen shoot glances back and forth, reading the situation 
clearly.

INT. COCKPIT OF PLANE - NIGHT

Mosely and Perry stand in front of the Captain.

               MOSELY
     Inspector Mosely, FBI.

               CAPTAIN
     Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?

               MOSELY
     What are you talking about?

               CAPTAIN
     You're here to pick up a prisoner, 
     right?

               MOSELY
     How'd you know that?

               CAPTAIN
     He was afraid to fly so he got off 
     the plane. He left with an Agent 
     Mosely.

Once again, Tuttle needlessly expounds on the obvious.

               TUTTLE
     Sir, that must mean that Walsh has 
     your identification.

Mosely can barely contain himself.

INT. SERRANO'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The Las Vegas skyline twinkles outside floor-to-ceiling 
windows. Serrano is on the phone speaking with restrained 
rage.

               SERRANO
     I thought you said he was going to 
     be on that plane.

INT. MIDTOWN BAR - NIGHT

Tony is on the other end of the phone. Joey leans in, trying 
to hear what Serrano is saying. The closeness irritates Tony, 
who turns away.

               DARUVO
     That's the information we got.

INTERCUT SERRANO AND TONY

               SERRANO
     You listen to me. I want this 
     motherfucker's lights out. And you 
     better get more personally involved 
     and stop sending other people to do 
     your job.

               DARUVO
     You got it.

               SERRANO
     If you don't, I'll stab you right 
     through the heart with a fucking 
     pencil.

They hang up. Tony, relieved to be off of the phone, turns 
to Joey.

               DARUVO
     What did I tell you? It's going to 
     be our ass.

EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

The Lake Shore Limited thunders past, into the night.

INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Walsh lies on the bed, writing on a pad. The Duke's voice 
can be heard from the bathroom.

               THE DUKE (O.S.)
     Jack...

Walsh ignores him.

               THE DUKE (O.S.)
     Jack...

Walsh tries to shut him out.

               THE DUKE (O.S.)
     Jack...

               WALSH
     What the fuck do you want!

               THE DUKE (O.S.)
     I told you I was claustrophobic.
          (Beat)
     Jack, I know you're upset with me 
     but it's stuffy in here. Come on, 
     Jack, what do you think I'm going to 
     do? Jump off a train going ninety 
     miles an hour?

Walsh finally gets up and opens the bathroom door. Uncuffs 
the Duke. Leads him over to the second bed. Cuffs him to 
that. Walsh sits back on his bed and continues his writing.

               THE DUKE
     Thank you, Jack.
          (Beat)
     What are you doing?

               WALSH
     Arithmetic.

               THE DUKE
     Maybe I can help you. I am an 
     accountant.

               WALSH
     Well, I was thinking. After I turn 
     your ass in and collect my money, I 
     want to open up a restaurant.

               THE DUKE
     How much is it, exactly, that you're 
     getting for me?

               WALSH
     A hundred thousand.

               THE DUKE
     Does that mean you'd let me go for a 
     hundred thousand?

               WALSH
     I never took a payoff in my life. 
     I'm not going to start now.

The Duke considers this for a second.

               THE DUKE
     A restaurant is a very tricky 
     investment, Jack. More than half of 
     them fail within the first year. As 
     an accountant, I would have to advise 
     you against it.

Walsh studies the Duke for a moment.

               THE DUKE
     What kind of restaurant were you 
     thinking about opening?

               WALSH
     A family restaurant.

               THE DUKE
     Why a family restaurant? Do you have 
     a family, or did they break the law 
     and you took them in, too? I'm sorry, 
     Jack. That was uncalled for.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A cigarette butt dangling from his lips, Moscone looks at 
his watch. He turns to Jerry.

               MOSCONE
     How the hell could he miss that plane? 
     He called from the goddamn airport.
          (Puts out cigarette)
     Look at this. I'm smokin' again. Get 
     Dorfler on the phone. See if he's 
     still in Pittsburgh.

Jerry reaches for the phone.

INT. PITTSBURGH MOTEL - NIGHT

A cheap room. Lit only by glow of the TV set. Eating junk 
food, Marvin Dorfler sits on the bed watching ROBIN LEACH 
wax euphoric about the French Riviera. Nearby, we can make 
out a thin, wired PITTSBURGH THUG, handcuffed to a radiator.

               PITTSBURGH THUG
     Could I at least have a french fry?

               DORFLER
     I told you, no. Shut up!

The phone RINGS. Dorfler picks it up.

INTERCUT DORFLER AND MOSCONE'S OFFICE

               JERRY
     Marvin. Hang on a second.
          (Calling out)
     Eddie, I got him.

Moscone picks up the phone.

               MOSCONE
     Marvin. I got a job for you. Big 
     money. I gave it to Walsh, but he's 
     fuckin' it up.

               DORFLER
     Well, I don't know why you keep hirin' 
     that guy.

               MOSCONE
     I know, Marvin. You're right. You're 
     the best. You always come through 
     for me. So, here's the job.

               DORFLER
     I'm listenin'.

               MOSCONE
     You ever hear of the Duke?

               DORFLER
     No.

               MOSCONE
     Jonathan Mardukas. The Duke.

               DORFLER
     I never heard of him.

               MOSCONE
     That's okay, Marvin. It's not 
     important. What is important is that 
     you've got to find him and get him 
     back here as soon as possible. Last 
     I heard, Walsh had him in New York. 
     But I don't know where the hell he 
     is now. You pick him up, I'll pay 
     you exactly what I'm payin' Walsh.

               DORFLER
     What's that?

               MOSCONE
     Twenty-five thousand. But you got to 
     get him back by midnight, Friday.

RESUME DORFLER

               DORFLER
     Don't worry. I'll get him.

Dorfler hangs up.

               DORFLER
          (To thug)
     Hey, scumbag.

               PITTSBURGH THUG
     You talkin' to me?

               DORFLER
     No, the guy behind you. Today's your 
     lucky day.

               PITTSBURGH THUG
     How's that?

Dorfler glances into his little black book. Filled with dark 
tidbits. He picks up the phone. Dials.

               DORFLER
          (into phone)
     American Express? This is Jack Walsh. 
     Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh. I lost 
     my card. I wanna know the last place 
     I used it. Here's the card number.

Dorfler reads off the credit card number. It checks out.

               DORFLER
     The Amtrak office at Grand Central 
     Station?

Dorfler smiles. He's gotten what he needs.

               DORFLER
     Thank you very much. By the way. 
     Maybe we better cancel that card.

Dorfler hangs up and stands. Shoves all of his wrinkled 
belongings into a huge duffelbag. Grabs his .45 and heads 
for the door.

               PITTSBURGH THUG
     Where are you going?

               DORFLER
     I'll be back in a few minutes, jerk-
     off. Wait here.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Dorfler closes the door. Moves for his rent-a-car. Tosses 
the duffelbag inside. Climbs in. Starts the car. SPINS his 
wheels toward the Pittsburgh turnpike.

INT. DINING CAR - NIGHT

Walsh eats his fried chicken dinner. The Duke, hand-cuffed, 
struggles to lay out a row of vitamins.

               THE DUKE
     Jack, this is very difficult.

               WALSH
          (Re: vitamins)
     What are you, a drug addict?

               THE DUKE
     No, these are vitamins.

               WALSH
     You piss ninety percent of that out 
     of your system.

               THE DUKE
     I'm not going to discuss nutrition 
     with a man who eats deep-fried food 
     and smokes cigarettes. And by the 
     way, people who smoke should take 
     extra vitamin C. If you'd like, I 
     could outline a complete program for 
     you.

               WALSH
     Mail it to me from "C" Block.

               THE DUKE
     I don't think you're as mean as you 
     pretend to be. Why do you smoke? You 
     know it's not good for you.

               WALSH
     I don't think about it.

               THE DUKE
     Well, that's living in denial.

               WALSH
     I'm aware of that.

               THE DUKE
     That sounds kind of foolish. Don't 
     you think, Jack?

               WALSH
     No. Stealing fifteen million dollars 
     from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.

               THE DUKE
     I didn't think I'd get caught.

               WALSH
     That's living in denial.

               THE DUKE
     I'm aware of that.

               WALSH
     Oh, so you're aware of your behavior 
     but continue to do things that aren't 
     good for you? Sounds sort of foolish, 
     don't you think, John?

               THE DUKE
     What I did helped a lot of people.

               WALSH
     So, you pissed off a mafioso killer 
     just to be loved by a bunch of fucking 
     strangers. That makes a lot of sense.

               THE DUKE
     Jack, do you have a family?

               WALSH
     I don't like sharing the intimate 
     details of my life with strangers.

               THE DUKE
     How far is it going to go? I'll 
     probably be dead in a few days.

               WALSH
     How do you figure that?

               THE DUKE
     With what I know about Serrano and 
     his business, I won't last twenty-
     four hours in jail. You know that.

               WALSH
     I have an ex-wife and daughter living 
     in Chicago.

               THE DUKE
     Oh, are we going to stop off and see 
     them?

               WALSH
     I haven't seen either of them in 
     nine years.

               THE DUKE
     You haven't seen your wife and 
     daughter in nine years?

               WALSH
     What is there, an echo in here?

               THE DUKE
     Your job must have been tough on 
     them.

               WALSH
     I was a cop then.

               THE DUKE
     You were a cop in Chicago? You must 
     know all about Jimmy Serrano.

               WALSH
     Yeah, I even met him a couple of 
     times.

               THE DUKE
     Really? What's he like in person?

               WALSH
     You have a way of worming things out 
     of people that I don't like.

Walsh shoves his food aside. Walsh gets up. Leaves two bucks 
for a tip.

               THE DUKE
     Two dollars? Is that all you're going 
     to leave?

               WALSH
     It's fifteen percent.

               THE DUKE
     It's thirteen percent. Look at the 
     bill. I'm an accountant, I know about 
     these things.

Walsh turns. Fishes around in his jacket for his wallet again. 
Finds it. Turns. The Duke is gone. Walsh bolts for the exit.

INT. PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT

Walsh BURSTS into the car looking for the Duke. Spots him 
going through the door at the far end. Walsh runs down the 
aisle, shoving passengers aside as he chases after the Duke.

INT. SECTION BETWEEN CARS - NIGHT

The sliding door HISSES open. Walsh enters the compartment. 
The Duke has already opened the door to the outside. The 
night RAGES by. The Duke wants to jump. Hesitates. Locks 
eyes with Walsh in a panic. Walsh stops.

               WALSH
     What are ya gonna do? Jump out of a 
     train goin' ninety miles an hour?

The Duke looks at Walsh.

               WALSH
     Go ahead. I'll get off at the next 
     stop, scoop ya up and mail ya back 
     to L.A.

The Duke thinks it over. He can't do it. Walsh walks over. 
Shuts the door. Yanks the Duke back toward their compartment.

EXT. CLEVELAND, OHIO TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

The Lake Shore Limited ROARS to a lumbering stop. CONDUCTORS 
and PORTERS step off the train. PASSENGERS start to board 
and exit. We recognize one of them. It's Marvin Dorfler. 
Looking as if he ran all the way from Pittsburgh.

INT. COACH PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT

Dorfler boards. The car interior is dark. The CONDUCTOR 
punches Dorfler's ticket. Dorfler moves down the aisle. 
Scanning the CROWDS. Some asleep. COUPLES cuddled in seats. 
A SAILOR sleeping across two seats. Dorfler heads into the 
next car. The train begins moving.

INT. SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT

The train ROCKS with speed. Dorfler moves through the sliding 
door. He approaches Miles, the porter.

               MILES
     Trying to find your room?

               DORFLER
     Nah. I'm looking for Jack Walsh's. 
     He told me to meet him there.

               MILES
     Number four. Next car.

               DORFLER
     Thanks.

Dorfler moves down the hall to the next car

INT. HALL OF LAST SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT

Dorfler moves silently down the hall. Finds room four. The 
coast is clear. Tries Walsh's door. It's locked. He slips in 
a lock pick. He opens the door silently. Removes his .45.

INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorfler peeks in. Walsh is faintly snoring. A train ROARS by 
in the opposite direction. Walsh stirs in his sleep. Dorfler 
slowly moves to the bathroom. Opens the door. Finds the Duke. 
Dorfler gags him with his hand and points his .45 at him.

               DORFLER
     One word and you're dead.

Suddenly, Walsh's fist SMASHES into the side of Dorfler's 
head.

INT. HALL OF SLEEPER - NIGHT

Walsh and Dorfler BLAST into the hallway. Tumble to the floor. 
Walsh punches Dorfler. Dorfler's .45 skids along the carpet. 
Miles appears in the hall. Walsh scoops up the .45 and points 
it at Dorfler. Flashes the FBI badge at Miles.

               WALSH
     Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
          (To Dorfler)
     How'd you find out where I was?

Walsh yanks Dorfler up. Dorfler rubs his bruised head.

               DORFLER
     Fuck you, shitheel. I don't have to 
     answer you. You ruined my fuckin' 
     car.

               WALSH
          (To Miles)
     Radio ahead. I want the local police 
     at the next stop to place this man 
     under arrest.

Dorfler grins. Starts laughing.

               DORFLER
     What the hell are you talking about?

Walsh SLAMS Dorfler's head into the wall. He sags. Collapses. 
Kisses the carpet.

               WALSH
     That's enough outta you.
          (To Miles)
     Go ahead. Get on the horn. Call the 
     cops.

The Duke whispers to Walsh.

               THE DUKE
     Who is this guy?

               WALSH
     Another bounty hunter. Count your 
     blessings he's not taking you in.

INT. HALL OF FBI OFFICE - NIGHT

Perry hurries down the hall heading for Mosely's office. 
KNOCKS. Enters.

INT. MOSELY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Walsh's belongings from the plane flight are scattered across 
his desk. Mosely looks out his window at the L.A. lights. He 
turns.

               MOSELY
     Good news or bad news?

               PERRY
     Mardukas and Walsh are on the Amtrak 
     headed to Los Angeles. Apparently, 
     another bounty hunter was arrested 
     after he tried to take Mardukas away.

               MOSELY
     I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.

EXT. SOUTH BEND, INDIANA TRAIN STATION - EARLY MORNING

The Lake Shore Limited ROARS into the station. Armed policemen

INT. SLEEPER CAR - EARLY MORNING

Mosely approaches Miles. Flashes his badge. Backed by the 
other Feds.

               MOSELY
     Where's Jack Walsh?

               MILES
     He got off. With the other fella. 
     Two or three stops ago.
          (Leaning in)
     His real name's Mosely.

               MOSELY
          (Enraged)
     I'm Mosely!

INT. FREMONT, OHIO BUS STATION - EARLY MORNING

The Duke stands cuffed to Walsh, who jabs a number into a 
pay phone. A BUM works his way through the row of phones, 
checking the coin returns. He reaches across Walsh, checking 
his phone for change. Walsh EXPLODES.

               WALSH
     Get outta here! Can't you see I'm on 
     the phone!

The Bum backs off.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jerry is half-asleep. Watching an old movie on TV. Moscone 
is crashed out on a cot in his office. The phone rings. 
Moscone yells from his sleep.

               MOSCONE
     Get it!

               JERRY
          (Into phone)
     Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE'S OFFICE

               WALSH
     Jerry, give me Moscone.

The sound of Walsh's voice snaps Jerry awake. This is the 
call he's been waiting for.

               JERRY
     Jesus, Jack, where are you?

Moscone has already heard. He grabs the phone at his desk.

               MOSCONE
     Jack. Where the fuck are you?

INT. FBI VAN - NIGHT

The two agents with headphones snap awake.

               WALSH (V.O.)
     How the hell did Dorfler end up on 
     my ass? Did you put him on this, you 
     son-of-a-bitch?

               MOSCONE (V.O.)
     How could I put him on you? I don't 
     even know where the hell you are! 
     Jack, you still got the Duke or what?

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE

Jerry is on the other line. Listening to every word.

               WALSH
     Yeah, I got him.

The Duke reaches into his pocket and hands the bum a few 
dollars.

               MOSCONE
     Where the hell are you?

               WALSH
     Somewhere between Cleveland and 
     Toledo. We're about to get on a bus 
     to L.A.

INT. FBI VAN - NIGHT

The two agents lock eyes. One nods. They've gotten the 
information.

               MOSCONE
     A bus? What the hell are you doing, 
     Jack? Are you out of your mind?

The DISPATCHER announces the departure of their bus over the 
P.A.

               WALSH
     I can't get into it right now, Eddie. 
     I just wanted to let you know we're 
     on our way. The bus is leaving. I'll 
     talk to you later.

Walsh hangs up.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Moscone lights a cigarette. Jerry picks up his jacket.

               MOSCONE
     What the hell is this guy doin'?

               JERRY
     I don't know, Eddie. You want me to 
     go get some donuts or something?

               MOSCONE
     What do I look like, a diabetic? And 
     where the hell is that goddamn 
     Dorfler?

               JERRY
     I don't know, Eddie. I think I'm 
     gonna step outside for some air.

Jerry turns. Moves quickly out of the office.

EXT. VIGNES STREET - NIGHT

Jerry hits the street. Trots for the pay phone at the corner. 
Passes the FBI van. Grabs the phone. Starts dialing.

INT. FBI VAN - NIGHT

Agent 1 watches Geisler through the rear window of the van.

INT. FREMONT, OHIO BUS STATION - EARLY MORNING

Walsh and the Duke stand at the ticket window.

               THE DUKE
     How's our schedule doing now, Jack?

               WALSH
     Don't worry. I'll get you there on 
     time.

A TICKET CLERK slides Walsh's credit card back to him.

               TICKET CLERK
     I'm sorry, sir, but this card has 
     been canceled.

               WALSH
     That's impossible.

               TICKET CLERK
     I double checked it. Sorry, I can't 
     accept it, sir.

Walsh digs into his pockets. It is apparent that he doesn't 
have enough money. He turns to the Duke.

               WALSH
     How much money you got?

               THE DUKE
     A lot.

Walsh digs into the Duke's pockets and comes up with a few 
bills.

               WALSH
     You call that a lot of money?

               THE DUKE
     I'm not the one who can't pay his 
     credit card bills.

Walsh finishes counting and slaps the money on the counter.

               WALSH
          (To Clerk)
     Just made it. Two tickets to L.A.

INT. HOLDING CELL OF ELYRIA POLICE STATION - DAY

Dorfler sits. Smoking cigarettes. A FEW LOCAL DETECTIVES 
nearby. Mosely enters with Tuttle and Plumides.

               DORFLER
     Who the fuck are you?

               MOSELY
     Mosely. FBI.

Dorfler panics.

               DORFLER
     Goddamnit! I didn't do anything!

               MOSELY
     Sit down. I just want to ask you 
     some questions.

Dorfler slides back into his seat. Mosely towers over him. 
Takes one of Dorfler's cigarettes. Lights it with Dorfler's 
lighter. Pockets the cigarettes.

               DORFLER
     Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.

Mosely lights it. Inhales. Blows a blue wad at Dorfler.

               MOSELY
     What do you know about Jack Walsh?

EXT. SERRANO'S PENTHOUSE BALCONY - DAWN

Serrano, in his silk robe. Sipping coffee, overlooking the 
city, desert and beyond. Neon against the desert dawn. Serrano 
is wired and loaded with adrenaline. The door-bell rings. 
Serrano, still locked in thought, heads inside.

INT. SERRANO'S PENTHOUSE - DOWN

Serrano crosses the room. A BODYGUARD is heading to open the 
door. Serrano reaches under his desk, pushing a button that 
unlocks the security door.

               SERRANO
          (To Bodyguard)
     I got it. Get outta here.

SID LYMAN, Serrano's attorney, enters.

               SERRANO
     What do you want, Sid?

               LYMAN
     I think you and I should talk. I 
     heard somebody picked Mardukas up in 
     New York.

               SERRANO
     Yeah, it's old news. I'm on it.

               LYMAN
     I don't have to tell you what will 
     happen if he becomes a government 
     witness.

               SERRANO
     That won't be the case.

               LYMAN
     I assumed you were taking that 
     position. I am supposed to advise 
     you against such acts.

               SERRANO
     Hey, Sid. Why don't you relax and 
     have a drink.
          (Looking at watch)
     It's all gonna be over in a couple 
     of minutes.

EXT. ELKHART, INDIANA SUBURBS - DAY

The Greyhound bus speeds by.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Walsh and the Duke sit toward the back. While Walsh tries to 
sleep, the Duke is wide awake.

               THE DUKE
     You know, the way you spoke to that 
     homeless man back there in the bus 
     station was a perfect example of 
     misdirected anger. You should learn 
     to focus on what is really hurting 
     you and work on that.

Walsh tries to ignore him.

               THE DUKE
     Can I ask why it is you haven't seen 
     your wife and daughter in nine years?

               WALSH
     My ex-wife got married to a police 
     captain and I'm not very popular 
     with the Chicago Police Department.

               THE DUKE
     Why aren't you popular with the 
     Chicago Police Department?

               WALSH
     Do we know each other?

               THE DUKE
     Did you do something wrong?

               WALSH
     That doesn't concern you.

               THE DUKE
     Are you hurt?

               WALSH
     No.

               THE DUKE
     I'm sorry.

               WALSH
     What are you sorry about?

               THE DUKE
     I asked if you were hurt and you 
     said you were sorry.

               WALSH
     I didn't say I was sorry. You said I 
     was sorry. You're starting to put 
     words in my mouth.

               THE DUKE
     You're a grown man. You have control 
     of your own words.

               WALSH
     You goddamn right I do. So, here 
     come two words for you. Shut the 
     fuck up!

INT. HOLDING CELL OF ELYRIA POLICE STATION - DAY

Perry enters. Motions quickly to Mosely. Mosely moves to 
Perry in the doorway. They talk quietly.

               PERRY
     Walsh called Moscone about a half 
     hour ago from outside of Toledo. 
     He's on a Greyhound bus headed for 
     Chicago.

               MOSELY
     Let's go.

They head for the door. A LOCAL DETECTIVE calls after him, 
motioning at Dorfler.

               LOCAL DETECTIVE
     Inspector. What do we do with this 
     guy?

               MOSELY
     Let him go.

Mosely moves out. Dorfler grabs his jacket. Turns to the 
local detective.

               DORFLER
     Son of a bitch took my cigarettes...

EXT. GARY, INDIANA GREYHOUND BUS STATION - DAY

A few cars scattered in the lot. A black Chrysler is parked 
toward the back end.

INT. CHRYSLER - DAY

Tony sits at the wheel. Smoking. He looks annoyed. Joey plays 
with a tassel that hangs from the rearview mirror.

               DARUVO
     What's wrong with you? Do you have 
     to touch everything? That's fuckin' 
     annoying.

Joey glances out at the platform. A GUY casually smokes a 
cigarette. ANOTHER reads a magazine. More GUYS can be seen 
in the terminal. It's another group of HITMEN. A SNIPER waits 
on a rooftop.

               JOEY
     Do you think we'll get 'em?

               DARUVO
     Fuck. They can't all miss.

EXT. GARY, INDIANA GREYHOUND BUS STATION - DAY

The bus swings into the terminal and HISSES to a stop. The 
door opens.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Through the sniper's cross-hairs, we see PASSENGERS beginning 
to file off of the bus.

INT. BUS - DAY

The Duke looks out the window, then turns to Walsh.

               THE DUKE
     Can I stretch my legs?

               WALSH
     Yeah, if you can do it sitting down.

               THE DUKE
     C'mon, Jack. We're going to be stuck 
     on this thing for a couple of days.

Walsh gives in. The two of them start down the aisle. Just 
as they are about to step off the bus...

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

From out of nowhere Federal cars swing up. Surrounding the 
bus. Mosely's car swings in. SLAMS its brakes. He gets out 
and heads the pack that approaches the bus.

INT. CHRYSLER - DAY

Tony and Joey's jaws drop.

               DARUVO
     Who the hell are these guys?

               JOEY
     They with us?

               DARUVO
     It's the fuckin' Feds.

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Neither Walsh nor the Duke have time to react. Perry SLAMS 
Walsh against the bus. Tuttle and Plumides SLAM the Duke 
against the bus. More FEDS surround them. LOCAL COPS appear. 
Both Walsh and the Duke are forced into the stressed spread-
eagle position. Mosely appears. Locks eyes with the Duke.

               MOSELY
     You and I have a lot of talking to 
     do.

Mosely puts on his sunglasses for effect. Looks at Walsh.

               MOSELY
     Remember me?

               WALSH
     Oh, yeah. Agent Foster Grant. Hey, 
     Alonzo, aren't ya gonna thank me for 
     doing your job for ya?

               MOSELY
     Thanks, Walsh.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Suddenly, the sniper takes aim and FIRES at the Duke.

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

He misses, hitting the side of the bus. Mosely swings out 
his .38. The sniper fires again. Hits a local cop. People 
SCREAM. Run. Hit the deck. Perry. Tuttle. Plumides. All pull 
out their pieces. More GUNFIRE. The hitman with the magazine 
FIRES. Walsh forces the Duke to the pavement. Bullets BLAST 
the windows of the Greyhound. More SCREAMS. The hitmen from 
the terminal are now on the platform. FIRING. Bullets SCREAM 
all around the Duke and Walsh. The hitman with the magazine 
keeps FIRING. Perry OPENS FIRE. The hitman sails over the 
railing. Mosely fixes on the sniper.

               MOSELY
     Freeze!

The sniper turns to fire. Mosely BLOWS the sniper off the 
roof.

INT. CHRYSLER - DAY

Watching from a distance.

to the passenger seat.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Walsh SLAMS the door. STARTS the car. GUNS it away.

INT. FBI CAR - DAY

The Duke is near hysterics.

               THE DUKE
     Oh, God! Oh, my God! Let me go.

               WALSH
     Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

               THE DUKE
     What was that? Why would they shoot 
     at us like that?

               WALSH
     Those were Serrano's people. He's 
     not even waiting until you get to 
     jail.

The Duke picks up a clipboard. He starts to read it.

               THE DUKE
     Alonzo Mosely? Isn't that the name 
     you've been using?

               WALSH
     Give me that.

Walsh yanks it away. Reading as he drives.

               WALSH
     Isn't that nice. This is Mosely's 
     car.

               THE DUKE
     If you want to turn me in, why are 
     you running away from the FBI?

               WALSH
     I only get my money when I deliver 
     you to L.A., not to the Feds
          (Re: clipboard)
     Goddamnit. They've got a wiretap on 
     Moscone's phone line.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Walsh turns off the road. A police chopper ROARS by. Heading 
for the bus station.

INT. FBI CAR - DAY

               WALSH
     We're not gonna get too far in a 
     stolen FBI car.

As they both get out, Walsh reaches into his pocket. Removes 
his sunglasses and sets them on the steering wheel.

               THE DUKE
     What's that for?

               WALSH
     It's an inside joke between me and 
     Alonzo.

EXT. AM/PM MINI-MART - DAY

Tony and Joey are at a pay phone. Joey polishing off a box 
of Cracker Jack. He TAPS the bottom of the box to get the 
crumbs.

               DARUVO
     Sorry, Jimmy, it didn't happen.

INT. SERRANO'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

Serrano is on the other end of the line, using the speaker 
box. Lyman sits at the bar, nervously sipping a drink.

INTERCUT SERRANO AND TONY

               SERRANO
     What was that again?

               DARUVO
     It didn't happen. There were about 
     thirty Feds there, along with local 
     heat. A lot of heads got popped.

Lyman paces. Nervous. Shakes his head.

               LYMAN
     You better get off the line, Jimmy.

               SERRANO
     Shut up.

               LYMAN
     If they've got a tap...

               SERRANO
          (Exploding)
     I said shut up!
          (Into phone)
     Where's Mardukas? In custody?

Joey fishes the prize out of the Cracker Jack box. Opens it. 
It's a whistle. Begins BLOWING it, annoyingly.

               DARUVO
     I don't know. There was so much 
     commotion, I don't know.

Joey BLOWS his whistle again.

               DARUVO
          (Covering phone)
     Will you knock it off!

               SERRANO
     Let me make it simple for you guys. 
     I am not to get another phone call 
     like this. If I do? I'll blowtorch 
     the both of yuz.

Serrano hangs up, then suddenly knocks the speaker box off 
the table.

               SERRANO
     Should've killed that son-of-a-bitch 
     Walsh back in Chicago.

EXT. GAIL BROONER'S HOUSE - DAY

Walsh climbs out of a cab with the Duke. Middle-class homes. 
Manicured lawns. Hands his last dollar bills over to the CAB 
DRIVER. The cab pulls away.

               WALSH
     I can't believe this. I haven't seen 
     them for nine years and the first 
     thing out of my mouth is gonna be 
     "can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"

               THE DUKE
     I have a feeling that this is going 
     to be very good for you.

They move toward the house. This is the first time Walsh 
appears unsure of himself. Slightly unkempt from the journey, 
he makes a feeble attempt to straighten out his hair and 
clothing. The Duke lends a hand, fixing Walsh's collar and 
adjusting a loose lock of hair.

               THE DUKE
     You look great.

Walsh RINGS the doorbell. They wait in expectant silence. 
Seven-year-old JASON opens the door and looks at Walsh and 
the Duke.

               JASON
     Who are you guys?

               WALSH
     I'm your mother's ex-husband.

Jason SLAMS the door.

               JASON (O.S.)
     Mom!

               THE DUKE
     Nice kid.

The door opens revealing GAIL BROONER. Very attractive. She 
stares at Walsh.

               GAIL
     Jack...

               WALSH
     Hi, Gail.

The Duke watches the strained exchange.

               GAIL
     They mentioned you and him on the 
     news this morning. Are you alright?

Walsh looks at her deeply. With desperate eyes.

               WALSH
     Can I come in for a few minutes?

She nods. Walsh and the Duke enter the house.

INT. GAIL BROONER'S HOUSE - DAY

They enter the foyer.

               GAIL
     You're in a lot of trouble. Did you 
     impersonate an FBI agent?

               WALSH
     Gail, I won't stay long. I need some 
     money to get to L.A. You know I'm 
     good for it.

Walsh feels shame. Fear. Confusion.

               WALSH
     I'm so embarrassed. I'm just in a 
     jam.
          (Smiles)
     You look so beautiful.

Gail bites her lip. Tears fill her eyes. She looks gorgeous. 
Meanwhile, Jason has been studying the Duke.

               JASON
     You don't look much like a criminal.

               THE DUKE
     I'm a white-collar criminal.

               GAIL
     Jack, you shouldn't be here. If Ted 
     comes home, he'll arrest you. And 
     him.

               WALSH
     Arrest us?
          (To the Duke)
     Then we'd really be in trouble, 'cause 
     I'm a little short on bribe money.

               GAIL
     Jack, don't start, please. Today's 
     not a good day for this.

               THE DUKE
     Yeah, Jack. Don't start.

               WALSH
     I'm sorry my fugitive timetable 
     doesn't coincide with your social 
     calendar.

               THE DUKE
     I don't think she was saying that, 
     Jack.

               WALSH
     Stay out of this, John.

               GAIL
     Same old Jack. Gets his feelings 
     hurt and tries to hurt everyone around 
     him.

               WALSH
     Gail, the last thing I need now is 
     one of your lectures.

               GAIL
     I'm trying to protect you, stupid! 
     Ted's going to be home any minute. 
     Tonight's a very important night for 
     us. We're all going out.

               WALSH
     What's so special about tonight? 
     Wait. Let me guess.
          (A beat)
     Payoff night.

               GAIL
     That's enough!

               THE DUKE
     Alright, everyone, let's not fight.

               WALSH
     I'm in a big fuckin' jam. I just 
     need some money. All I've got to do 
     is just get this guy to L.A. and I'm 
     out of this miserable business 
     forever.

Walsh's 15-year-old daughter, DENISE BROONER, appears in the 
doorway. A vision. Walsh turns with a lump in his throat. 
The Duke looks at her. At Walsh. Emotions fly through the 
room. Walsh can barely speak.

               WALSH
     Hi.
          (Clears his throat)
     Hi, Denise.

Denise floats across the room. Approaches her haggard father. 
Looks into his eyes. Holds him tight. Gail fights tears. 
Loses. Tears roll down her face. Walsh hugs Denise as tight 
as he can. Still cuffed to the Duke, he drags the reminder 
of who he is.

               DENISE
     Hi, Daddy.

               WALSH
     You're so grown-up.

They break their embrace. He looks into Denise's eyes.

               WALSH
     That's all I wanted to do. Just hold 
     you for a minute.

Walsh turns to Gail.

               WALSH
     I'll go now.
          (A beat)
     I'm sorry.

               GAIL
     Hang on.

She disappears into the kitchen. Walsh looks at the Duke. 
Gail comes back with cash and car keys. Hands them to Walsh.

               GAIL
     I only have forty dollars but you 
     can take my car if you want. I'll 
     tell Ted it's in the shop. We'll 
     worry about it after you get to L.A.

Walsh slowly takes the keys.

               WALSH
     Does he take good care of you?

Gail nods affirmatively.

               WALSH
     That's all I want to know.
          (A beat)
     What will he say about this?

               GAIL
     He'll understand.

Walsh looks at her. There's so much distance. So much time. 
So much unsaid. He nods.

               WALSH
     That's love.

EXT. GAIL BROONER'S DRIVEWAY - DAY

Walsh exits the house and cuffs the Duke inside the LTD. 
Denise follows, approaching her father. She has a stack of 
bills in her hands.

               DENISE
     It isn't much. About a hundred and 
     eighty dollars. Baby-sitting money. 
     Take it.

               WALSH
     I can't do that, sweetheart.

               DENISE
     Please...
          (A beat)
     Daddy.

Walsh looks at her. There's so much to say. No time. He takes 
the money. Nods. Gets into the LTD. Pulls out quickly. Denise 
remains on the lawn, watching them descend into the distance.

INT. LTD - DAY

Walsh is silent, watching his daughter fade from sight in 
the rearview mirror.

               THE DUKE
     You have a beautiful daughter, Jack.

               WALSH
     I'd just like to be quiet for a while.

Walsh continues to drive. Then, out of nowhere, pulls a U-
turn.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The LTD SWINGS completely around. Heading back the way it 
came.

EXT. GAIL BROONER'S HOUSE - DAY

Denise watches the LTD returning. Suddenly, from behind her, 
her stepfather, Gail's husband, TED BROONER, pulls his car 
into the driveway.

INT. LTD - DAY

Still at a distance, Walsh slows to a stop. He watches the 
sad sight. All of what he could have been. Ted, well dressed 
and unaware of Walsh's presence, puts his arm around Denise, 
leading her back to the house. Just before she disappears 
inside the doorway, she turns, giving her real father a 
farewell glance. Walsh, in a trance, watches the door close. 
The Duke sits quietly. With a start, Walsh drives up to the 
house. He gets out of the car.

EXT. GAIL BROONER'S HOUSE - DAY

Walsh crosses the lawn. Approaches the front door. Out of 
his pocket, he takes the money that Denise gave him. Puts it 
in the mailbox. He turns and heads back to the LTD. Drives 
off.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Highway traffic roars in the background. Walsh, wrestling 
with a road map, punches in a telephone number. The Duke 
cuffed alongside of him.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

Jerry grabs the RINGING phone.

               JERRY
          (Into phone)
     Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE'S OFFICE WALSH

               WALSH
     Jerry, Jack. Give me Moscone.

Jerry is nervous. He keeps feeding the mob bad information. 
He SHOUTS at Moscone's cubicle.

               JERRY
     Hey, Eddie, it's Jack.

Jerry listens in.

INT. FBI VAN - DAY

The two agents snap awake.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

Moscone is in the middle of a rap with a lawyer and a 
criminal. He cuts them off with a wave. Grabs the phone.

               MOSCONE
     Jack. Where are you?

               WALSH
     I'm in Boise, Idaho.

INT. FBI VAN - DAY

The agents start writing.

               WALSH (V.O.)
     No, wait a minute. I'm in Casper, 
     Wyoming.
          (A beat)
     No, wait. I'm in Anchorage, Alaska. 
     I'm in the lobby of a Howard 
     Johnson's. I'm wearing a pink 
     carnation.

The agents lock eyes with confusion.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

               MOSCONE
     What the hell are you talkin' about?

               WALSH
     I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' 
     to the other guys.

               MOSCONE
     What other guys?

               WALSH
     Let me describe the scene to you.

INT. FBI VAN - DAY

The four agents listen.

               WALSH (V.O.)
     There's these guys, see? They've 
     probably been up for two days. So, 
     they stink of B.O., have coffee 
     breath, and they're constipated and 
     have hemorrhoids from sitting on 
     their asses for so long.

The agents shift nervously. One looks at his thermos coffee 
cup.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

               WALSH (V.O.)
     They're sitting in a van. Probably 
     parked up the street from your office.

Moscone takes the phone over to the window. Parts the blinds. 
Spots the van on the corner.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

               WALSH
     But now they're gonna have to pack 
     up all their shit and go home, because 
     I'm onto them! You dumb fucks! I'm 
     not usin' this line anymore!

INT. FBI VAN - DAY

The agents lock eyes realizing they've been had.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE

               WALSH
     Hey, Eddie.

               MOSCONE
     Yeah, Jack.

               WALSH
     Go to Denny's. I'll call you in five 
     minutes. They can't run a tap that 
     fast.

               MOSCONE
     Right.

               WALSH
          (To agents)
     So long, everybody.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

The phone RINGS. The MANAGER takes it. Hands it to Moscone, 
who leans next to the register.

               MOSCONE
          (Into phone)
     Jack?

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE

               WALSH
     I need you to wire me five hundred 
     to the Western Union Office in 
     Amarillo, Texas.

               MOSCONE
     What do you need with five hundred 
     on a bus? And why the hell aren't 
     you on a plane?

               WALSH
     Did it ever occur to you that I am a 
     professional and that I might have 
     my reasons? We're driving now and I 
     only have enough cash to get me to 
     Amarillo. We had to scrap the bus.

               MOSCONE
          (Starting to yell)
     Fuck the bus, I'd like to know what 
     happened to the goddamn plane?

               WALSH
     He doesn't like to fly.

               MOSCONE
          (Exploding)
     He doesn't like to fly!?! What the 
     fuck does that mean!?! You have to 
     be back here in less than two and a 
     half days. What the fuck are you 
     doing out there, Jack?

               WALSH
     Eddie, I swear to God, don't start 
     with me now or I'll shoot him and 
     dump him in the swamp.

Walsh shakes his head to the Duke.

               WALSH
     I'm in no fuckin' mood for this. 
     Just send me the money and I'll have 
     him back by the deadline.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY

Moscone enters. Approaches Jerry.

               MOSCONE
     Hey, Jerry, wire five hundred dollars 
     to Walsh in Amarillo, Texas.

Jerry nods. Moscone walks a few steps. Turns.

               MOSCONE
     And maybe you ought to see if you 
     can't get Dorfler down there, too.

EXT. VIGNES STREET - DAY

Once again, Jerry trots for his phone booth.

INT. FBI VAN - DAY

For the second time, AGENT 1 watches Geisler through the 
rear window of the van.

               AGENT 1
          (To Agent 2)
     Let's run a tap on that phone booth. 
     Something's going on here.

EXT. OKLAHOMA - NIGHT

The LTD continues its journey west.

INT. LTD - NIGHT

Walsh and the Duke sit quietly. After a few moments, the 
Duke starts to sing softly.

               THE DUKE
     Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the 
     wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer. 
     If one of those...

Walsh silences him with a look.

               THE DUKE
     What happened to you back in Chicago? 
     Your wife married a corrupt cop?

               WALSH
     They're all bad.

               THE DUKE
     There's good and bad everywhere, 
     don't you think?

               WALSH
     There's bad everywhere. Good? I don't 
     know about.

The Duke hits a nerve.

               THE DUKE
     What happened to you?

               WALSH
     I tried to bust this big-time dealer. 
     The guy practically supplied the 
     whole city with heroin. I got close 
     to him, gained his confidence. It 
     took me a year. Just as I was ready 
     to nail the son-of-a-bitch, 
     mysteriously, my fellow officers 
     discovered seven pounds of heroin in 
     my house. They gave me a choice. Get 
     on the payroll like everyone else, 
     get out of town, or go to jail for 
     30 years.

               THE DUKE
     So you left town?

               WALSH
     Yeah. And that's why I do this. When 
     I find a criminal, like yourself, I 
     bring him in. I don't have to worry 
     about anybody getting bribed or paid 
     off because there is no "anybody." 
     There's just me.

               THE DUKE
     So, I guess that means that any offer 
     I might make would be a waste of 
     time.

Walsh's silence confirms this.

               THE DUKE
     Let me ask you something. Do you 
     miss your wife and daughter?

               WALSH
     I don't think much about it.

               THE DUKE
     There's that denial thing again.

               WALSH
     I know in some twisted way you mean 
     well, but will you please stay out 
     of my personal life?

               THE DUKE
     You can't just avoid the things that 
     hurt you. You've got to attack them 
     head on. Sooner or later you're going 
     to have to take a "front row" approach 
     to life, Jack.

EXT. AMARILLO COFFEE SHOP - EARLY MORNING

The LTD rolls up to a coffee shop. Walsh and the Duke get 
out. Arching the kinks out of their backs, they head in.

INT. AMARILLO COFFEE SHOP - EARLY MORNING

Eggs and bacon sizzle lusciously on the hot griddle. A YOUNG 
RANCH HAND stuffs his mouth with a massive forkful of steaming 
hotcakes. Walsh and the Duke eye all this from their seats 
at the counter. A WAITRESS approaches.

               WAITRESS
     What can I do for you, boys?

               WALSH
     Two coffees.

               THE DUKE
     I'd prefer herbal tea.
          (To Walsh)
     As a bounty hunter, are you licensed 
     to starve your victims?

               WALSH
     In ten minutes we'll have five hundred 
     bucks. I'll buy ya a nice juicy steak.

               THE DUKE
     I don't eat meat. It's filled with 
     carcinogens and steroids.

               WALSH
     You know, you're a very smart guy, 
     John. You know everything about 
     everything. But you don't know enough 
     to stay out of other people's 
     business. If you had left Serrano 
     alone, none of this would be happening 
     to you.

               THE DUKE
     I had a way out of this, Jack!

               WALSH
     Oh, really.

               THE DUKE
     I was going to put all of Serrano's 
     records on computer diskettes as an 
     insurance policy. I figured I could 
     always trade it over in exchange for 
     my life if things got too rough.

               WALSH
     Why didn't you just leave him alone?

               THE DUKE
     Why didn't you just ignore corruption 
     in the police department?

               WALSH
     Because I couldn't live with myself, 
     that's why.

               THE DUKE
     That's how I felt, Jack. I wasn't 
     some mob accountant. I thought I 
     worked in a legitimate firm. When I 
     found out I was managing accounts 
     that were really fronts for Serrano, 
     I just couldn't sit back and do 
     nothing.

               WALSH
     So, you decided to take what didn't 
     belong to you.

               THE DUKE
     Jack, I gave practically all of it 
     to charity. How can you take the 
     side of a mobster?

               WALSH
     I'm not taking his side.

               THE DUKE
     You're taking his side, if you're 
     not taking mine.

               WALSH
     I'm not taking anybody's side. I've 
     got nothing to do with this.

Walsh checks his Timex.

               WALSH
     Time to go.

               THE DUKE
     Why do you wear that old watch?

               WALSH
     I'll tell you when I know you better.

Walsh cuffs the Duke and drags him toward the door.

INT. TONY AND JOEY'S CAR - DAY

Tony and Joey sit in their car just up the block from the 
Western Union office. Tony scans the street. Joey eats some 
chips and drinks a Coke.

               JOEY
     You know what we should get? One of 
     those little trays that you keep in 
     the car, so you don't spill food and 
     drinks all over the place.

EXT. AMARILLO STREET - DAY

Walsh and the Duke cross the street, heading for the Western 
Union office.

INT. TONY AND JOEY'S CAR - DAY

Tony spots them.

               DARUVO
     There they are.

Tony and Joey get out of the car.

EXT. AMARILLO STREET - DAY

Tony and Joey cross the street, guns in coats, approaching 
Walsh and the Duke. Walsh sees them. Freezes.

               DARUVO
     Don't fuckin' move asshole.
          (To Walsh)
     I don't wanna kill you.
          (To the Duke)
     I just want you.

The Duke is panic-stricken. From out of nowhere, Dorfler 
appears behind Tony and Joey, cocking his. 45.

               DORFLER
     Drop 'em.

Tony and Joey turn.

               DORFLER
     You heard me. Drop 'em.

Tony and Joey drop their guns.

               DORFLER
     Who the fuck are you guys?

               DARUVO
     Who the fuck are you?

Dorfler K.O.'s Tony with the butt of his. 45. Tony eats the 
pavement.

               JOEY
     You're dead. You know who you're 
     fuckin' with?

               DORFLER
     No. Why don't you tell me about it. 
     And make sure you speak into the 
     microphone.

On "microphone," Dorfler WHACKS the butt of his. 45 into 
Joey's mouth. Walsh and the Duke watch the scene.

               DORFLER
          (To Walsh)
     Give me the keys to the cuffs.

               WALSH
     Sure, Marvin.

Walsh takes out the keys and then tosses them into the sewer.

               WALSH
     Looks like a package deal to me, 
     Marvin.

               THE DUKE
     Front row, Jack!

               DORFLER
     Alright, both of you, come on.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE OF TOWN - DAY

Dorfler's car makes tracks through the Amarillo country-side.

INT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Dorfler at the wheel, the Duke in between him and Walsh. 
They are sandwiched into the front seat.

               DORFLER
     Who the hell were those guys?

               WALSH
     Oh, Marvin. You've done it this time.

               DORFLER
     What are you talking about?

               WALSH
     Those were hired killers back there.

               DORFLER
     Hired to kill who?

               WALSH
          (Re: the Duke)
     Hired to kill him.

               DORFLER
     Hired by who?

               WALSH
     Jimmy Serrano.

               DORFLER
     Oh, fuck! Why do they wanna kill 
     him?

               WALSH
     Marvin, don't ya read the newspapers?

               THE DUKE
     I can't take this.

               WALSH
     How the fuck did you know where we 
     were?

               THE DUKE
     I can't take this anymore.

               WALSH
     Shut up a minute.
          (To Dorfler)
     Did Moscone put you on this?

               DORFLER
     Of course Moscone put me on this.

               WALSH
     That no good son of a bitch. I got a 
     contract with him!

               DORFLER
     You got a contract?

               WALSH
     Yeah. I signed it on Monday.

               DORFLER
     He called me in Pittsburgh. He said 
     you were fuckin' this up.

               WALSH
     I'm not fuckin' this up.

               DORFLER
     You should of been in L.A. over two 
     days ago.

               WALSH
     Don't tell me how to do my goddamn 
     job. I'm half-thinkin' not to turn 
     him in just to watch Moscone go down 
     the toilet.

               THE DUKE
     That's an excellent thought.

INT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Circling once more, the chopper comes up behind them. M-16's 
open FIRE. BLOW OUT the back window.

               WALSH
     This is bullshit! We're sittin' ducks, 
     Marvin! Get off the fucking road.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

The three sharpshooters lean out. OPEN FIRE again.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

A bridge spans a huge gorge. ROARING rapids below. An eighteen-
wheel tractor trailer is approaching. So is the helicopter.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

They are just about to enter the bridge. SWERVING. Ducking 
bullets. The Duke sees the oncoming truck.

               THE DUKE
     Look out!

Dorfler cuts the wheel.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Dorfler misses the truck by a few feet. The chopper misses 
by inches. ROARS skyward. The truck nearly jackknifes trying 
to get out of the way. Dorfler swerves off of the road, just 
short of the bridge. SLAMS through the guardrailing.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

Dorfler's car SAILS down the steep embankment. SIDE-SWIPES 
huge rocks and trees. The brush and rocks in its path don't 
slow the car down.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

The Duke SCREAMS. Walsh braces for the impact. Dorfler steers 
down the obstacle course of rocks and trees heading for the 
rapids.

               DORFLER
     Okay. Okay. I got it.

SIDESWIPES a tree. Keeps going.

               DORFLER
     Hang in. Relax. I've got it.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

The car SLAMS to a halt, wedging itself between two boulders, 
just a few feet from the edge of the rapids. The chopper 
swings around over the top of the bridge.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Dorfler's gun bounces to the floor. The Duke grabs it. Points 
it at Walsh and Dorfler.

               THE DUKE
     Nobody move.

Walsh grabs the gun out of the Duke's hand.

               WALSH
     Give me that.

Dorfler grabs the gun.

               DORFLER
     That's mine.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

The chopper roars overhead. Bullets EXPLODE around them. The 
doors are blocked by the boulders. Walsh, the Duke and Dorfler 
are forced to crawl out through the windows. Dive for cover. 
The chopper circles, then moves in for the kill.

INT. CHOPPER - DAY

The Sharpshooters take aim. Open FIRE.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

The bullets EXPLODE around Walsh, the Duke and Dorfler. The 
Duke falls, dragging Walsh with him. Dorfler FIRES at the 
helicopter with his .45. Walsh removes keys from his pocket 
and starts to uncuff the Duke.

               DORFLER
     I thought you threw those out.

               WALSH
     Always check the evidence, Marvin. 
     Those were car keys.

The Duke begins to smile.

               WALSH
          (To the Duke)
     They're not after me.

The Duke's smile vanishes.

               WALSH
     Just kiddin'.

Walsh climbs behind a group of boulders. Pulls out his .45. 
FIRES with Dorfler at the chopper.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

A bullet hits the glass bubble, EXPLODING it into the cockpit. 
The PILOT swings the chopper away.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

The chopper comes around for the kill again. The Duke tries 
to hide behind a huge boulder. Bullets EXPLODE all around 
him. He inches around the boulder, trying to keep it between 
him and the chopper. Each quickly changing directions to 
outsmart the other. A serious game of cat and mouse. The 
Duke loses his balance. He falls backwards into the rapids. 
Bullets SPRAY all around him. He disappears into the white-
water. Walsh is about to jump in after him but a hail of 
bullets forces him to stay put.

               WALSH
     Son of a bitch! Well, Marvin, there 
     goes a hundred grand.

               DORFLER
     A hundred? You're getting a hundred?

               WALSH
     Why? What was Moscone gonna pay you?

               DORFLER
     Twenty-five.

Walsh smiles. Bullets FIRE. They duck.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

One of the sharpshooters spots the Duke. Taps the Pilot. 
Points.

EXT. RAPIDS - DAY

Water ROARING. The Duke struggles to keep afloat in the 
nightmarish current. The chopper opens FIRE at him.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

Walsh sees the chopper's vulnerability. Its tail rotor.

               WALSH
     Marvin. Give me another clip!

               DORFLER
     What? I need it myself!

               WALSH
     Give me the fuckin' clip!

Dorfler hesitates. Looks at the chopper. To Walsh. Then tosses 
him the clip. Walsh jams it into his .45.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

The sharpshooters RIDDLE the water surrounding the Duke with 
GUNFIRE.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

Walsh moves along the bank. Gets a good solid line on the 
tail rotor. Crouches. Raises his arm. Sights in. Then smiles.

               WALSH
     Say good night, Gracie.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! SMACK! The STING of metal hitting 
metal. The tail rotor EXPLODES.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

The joystick slips from the Pilot's hands.

               PILOT
     We're hit!

EXT. GORGE - DAY

With a deafening high-pitched whine, the chopper swings madly 
out of control. Dorfler drops his jaw. Can't believe it. 
Walsh grins. The chopper ROARS at them. They hit the deck. 
ROARS back into the sky and starts its deadly descent toward 
the wall of the gorge. Heads straight for it. SLAMS into it. 
EXPLODES into a FIREBALL. GUSHING FLAMES AND SHRAPNEL for a 
hundred yards.

               DORFLER
     Goddamn, Jack. You did it!

Walsh smiles, then points.

               WALSH
     Marvin, watch out!

Walsh punches Dorfler square in the jaw. Dorfler falls back, 
hitting the car. Walsh digs in Dorfler's pockets. Pulls out 
Dorfler's cuffs and keys. Cuffs him to the open car door and 
tosses the keys into the water. Dorfler is coming to.

               WALSH
     See you in L.A., Marvin!

Walsh dives into the rapids.

EXT. RAPIDS - DAY

The Duke, trying to swim, grabs for debris lodged between 
rocks. Stops. Unsurvivable white-water ROARS just ahead. 
Holding onto the debris for dear life, he pulls himself along. 
Slowly. Surely. Inches toward a boulder. Walsh comes bouncing 
down the rapids on the same path that the Duke has just taken. 
He sees the Duke pulling himself to safety. Walsh reaches 
out as he passes. Grabs for the same debris. SLAMS into it. 
Dislodges all of it. He and the Duke ROAR down the rapids 
together clinging to the same log. Moving into the white-
water.

               THE DUKE
     Goddamnit, I was almost safe!

They ride the log, holding on for dear life. A group of 
boulders are ahead. Water RUSHES between them. The log slams 
into the boulders, getting caught between two of them. Duke's 
back is against the current. Walsh is on the other side of 
the log. He's losing his grip. The rapids beyond invite death.

               WALSH
     I'm slipping! Give me your hand!

               THE DUKE
     Promise you'll let me go!

               WALSH
     Fuck you!

               THE DUKE
     Promise me!

               WALSH
     Fuck you!

               THE DUKE
     You're making it very hard for me to 
     do the right thing here, Jack.

               WALSH
          (Slipping)
     Alright! Alright! I'll let you go! I 
     promise.

The Duke reaches for Walsh. Grabs him. Together, they lunge 
for the boulder as the log breaks free, disappearing into a 
field of white. They climb to safety.

EXT. BANK - AFTERNOON

Drenched to the core. Exhausted. They crawl ashore.

               THE DUKE
     Where's Dorfler?

               WALSH
     He's watchin' the car. Thanks for 
     savin' me.

               THE DUKE
     Thanks for letting me go.

               WALSH
     I'll let you go, alright.
          (Cuffing him)
     The second you're in the L.A. County 
     Jail.

               THE DUKE
     I just saved your life!

               WALSH
          (Yanking up the Duke)
     Come on.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Looking like shit, Walsh and the Duke walk slowly along the 
side of the rural road. A dilapidated pickup truck snakes 
toward them. Walsh uncuffs the Duke then waves it to a stop. 
BILLY, an overweight Indian, with a black ponytail and black 
cowboy hat, is at the wheel. Two other INDIANS are crammed 
in the front seat. FOUR more sit on the bed of the truck.

               WALSH
     How's it goin', gentlemen? Do you 
     think you can give me and my friend 
     a ride to the nearest town?

               BILLY
     Sure. Pile in.

EXT. GORGE - DAY

We recognize the bridge. It's where the chopper went down. A 
dozen police cars are on it. Several COPS lean over the side 
of the bridge. They watch a man SCREAMING in the gorge. 
Handcuffed to a car. Dorfler.

               DORFLER
     That's right! Down here! Get me the 
     fuck outta here!

INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY

Mosely sits alone, looking like he's been working long hours. 
Perry approaches, handing him a teletype page.

               PERRY
     This just came in.

               MOSELY
     Is it going to upset me?

               PERRY
     I think it's safe to say that.

EXT. MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, LAS VEGAS - DAY

Jets THUNDER overhead. Joey and Tony stand in front of the 
United terminal holding their luggage. With a handkerchief, 
Tony nurses a huge bruise on the side of his face from the 
whack of Dorfler's .45. Joey sports a fat lip. Serrano's 
black limousine pulls up. It feels angry. A CHAUFFEUR takes 
their bags. Tony and Joey reluctantly get inside.

INT. SERRANO'S LIMO - DAY

Serrano is in back. Also, Sid Lyman. They face Tony and Joey. 
The car moves quickly away from the terminal area. Serrano 
is livid.

               SERRANO
     What's the problem with you guys? 
     The guy's a fuckin' accountant!

               DARUVO
     It's been bad luck down the line. 
     Plus this guy, Walsh, is pretty good.

               SERRANO
     Well, if he's so fuckin' good, maybe 
     I should hire him to hit you.

               LYMAN
     Is any of this going to come back to 
     him?

               DARUVO
     No. None of it. We rented the chopper 
     through Detroit.

               JOEY
          (To Serrano)
     It's five times removed from you. So 
     you're clear of this. Don't worry.

               SERRANO
          (Exploding)
     I'm clear of shit! He's still out 
     there!
          (Yelling to Chauffeur)
     Pull the fuck over!
          (To Tony and Joey)
     Get out of the car!

               LYMAN
     Jimmy...

               SERRANO
     Shut up, Sid.
          (To Tony and Joey)
     Get the fuck out of the car!

The limo pulls to the side of the road. A confused Tony and 
Joey sheepishly exit.

               SERRANO
     I have no interest whatsoever in 
     seeing the two of you alive again 
     unless you have the accountant! You 
     understand?

EXT. LAS VEGAS ROADSIDE - DAY

The limo peels away, leaving Tony and Joey in the dust.

               JOEY
     How do we get our luggage back?

EXT. INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY

The middle of nowhere. Chickens scatter avoiding the pickup 
truck as it pulls up to a dilapidated general store. The 
Indians pile out. Other Indians sit on indoor furniture that 
has been left outside. An old crop duster is parked to one 
side of the general store. It catches the Duke's eye.

               BILLY
     This is the end of the ride.

Walsh stares at the sights.

               WALSH
     What the hell kind of town is this?

An OLD INDIAN WOMAN sits on the porch.

               THE DUKE
     Is there a bathroom in there I could 
     use?

She nods "yes." The Duke turns to Walsh.

               THE DUKE
     Is it alright, Jack?

               WALSH
     G'head.

The Duke disappears inside. Walsh studies the lonely landscape 
of old cars and shacks. In their native language, a few 
INDIANS sitting nearby are having a good laugh at the expense 
of Walsh's bedraggled appearance. Walsh does his best to 
ignore them. The sound of a large engine coming to life fills 
the air. Walsh, pacing along the porch, casually glances in 
the direction of the crop duster as it slowly starts to taxi 
away. His eyes widen as he realizes that the man in the open 
cockpit is the Duke. It appears that the Duke is not afraid 
of flying. The prop spins with life. The SOUND of the crop 
duster intensifies. Walsh can't believe how badly he's been 
taken. As the crop duster moves away, Walsh goes berserk.

               WALSH
     Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?

Walsh runs after the plane, sprinting the length of the 
reservation to catch up with the taxiing plane. The Duke 
swings it around for takeoff, now moving toward Walsh. As it 
moves past him, Walsh grabs onto the wing and hoists himself 
alongside the cockpit. The plane ROARS with life. He reaches 
for the Duke. The Duke tries to push Walsh off and maintain 
control at the same time.

               WALSH
     Fear of flying, my ass! Get out of 
     that plane, you son of a bitch.

               THE DUKE
     My work is done here, Jack. I've 
     reopened the lines of communication 
     between you, your ex-wife and your 
     daughter.

               WALSH
     I'm gonna open your fuckin' head.

               THE DUKE
     And I think you're well on your way 
     to reexamining who you are as a human 
     being.

Walsh grabs the Duke halfway out of the cockpit. The plane 
zig-zags wildly through the field.

               THE DUKE
     You're going to get us killed!

               WALSH
     I don't give a fuck.

Walsh right-hooks the Duke, knocking him out, then manages 
to yank him from the cockpit. They both fall to the ground. 
The pilotless crop duster aimlessly taxis in circles. Indians 
come running from every direction. Walsh shoves the Duke 
back toward the general store. Indians surround them angrily. 
SHOUTING. Walsh pulls out his .45. Points it in every 
direction. It gets quiet fast.

               WALSH
     Shut the fuck up! All of ya!

He moves through the circle, dragging the Duke by his collar.

               WALSH
          (To the Duke)
     Let me tell you about the coffee 
     shop I'm gonna open after I dump you 
     off and collect my hundred grand. 
     You're gonna love it. Maybe when you 
     get out, if they don't kill you first, 
     you can come pay me a visit.

They approach Billy's pickup truck. Walsh points the gun at 
Billy.

               WALSH
     Give me the keys to the truck.

               THE DUKE
     You just can't take their truck.

               WALSH
     You were about to take their plane.

Walsh pulls the Duke's watch off of his wrist and tosses it 
to Billy. Billy complies. Walsh takes the keys and cuffs the 
Duke inside the truck.

               WALSH
     Hey, maybe I'll even call it "Duke's 
     Place." Y'know. Out of respect to 
     you.

Walsh gets in behind the wheel. Fires it up. Roars off.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The truck barrels down the road.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Walsh sits behind the wheel, angry. The Duke at his side.

               THE DUKE
     Jack. Let's be fair about this. You 
     lied to me, too. At the river you 
     promised to let me go.

               WALSH
     You lied to me first.

               THE DUKE
     Yes. But the river was before you 
     knew I had lied to you. So that really 
     doesn't count. Don't you think, Jack?

               WALSH
     What?

               THE DUKE
     It's wrong that I lied to you. But 
     you had no knowledge that I was lying 
     about my aviophobia when we were in 
     the river, when you lied to me.

               WALSH
     I can't even argue with you. I don't 
     know what the fuck you're talking 
     about.

A town is up ahead. Walsh is gripping his stomach.

               WALSH
     Ah, shit!

               THE DUKE
     Have you got an ulcer. Jack?

               WALSH
     Yes, I've got an ulcer! A big fuckin' 
     ulcer! And all your bullshit is 
     startin' to make it bleed again.

               THE DUKE
     We better get something to coat it.

               WALSH
     I need somethin' to eat! That's what 
     I need!

               THE DUKE
     I can take care of that.

EXT. RED'S CORNER BAR - DAY

The truck slows to a stop.

INT. TRUCK - DAY

Walsh looks at the bar. Looks at the Duke.

               WALSH
     Now what?

               THE DUKE
     Give me that FBI badge.

Walsh hesitates.

               THE DUKE
     Do you want to eat that shit you eat 
     or not?

Walsh studies him for a moment.

               WALSH
     If you fuck with me...

               THE DUKE
     Yeah, you'll hit me in the head and 
     drop me in a thing...

INT. RED'S CORNER BAR - DAY

The Duke bursts in the front door followed by Walsh. Makes 
his way to the CASHIER. The Duke speaks with urgency.

               THE DUKE
     I want to speak to the manager 
     immediately.

               CASHIER
          (Taken aback)
     Alright, just a minute, sir.

He calls over the MANAGER. Walsh and the Duke lock eyes.

               RED
     May I help you?

               THE DUKE
          (Flashing badge)
     Alonzo Mosely, FBI. My partner and I 
     have been tracking a ring of 
     counterfeiters who have been passing 
     phony one-hundred-dollar bills 
     throughout the state. Have you 
     received any hundred-dollar bills in 
     the last couple of hours?

               RED
     I received one just 20 minutes ago.

               THE DUKE
          (To cashier)
     Would you mind opening the register, 
     please.

The manager gives a nod of approval. The cashier complies.

               THE DUKE
          (To cashier)
     Let me see all of them.

She reaches for the bills. The Duke stops her.

               THE DUKE
     No, no! Don't touch them.

Walsh uses a paper napkin to take the bills from the cash 
register. The Duke clears the counter and proceeds to lay 
the bills out methodically. The employees look on attentively.

               THE DUKE
          (Snapping fingers)
     Give me that pencil. Confract two.

The cashier hands over her pencil to the Duke. He slides the 
bills and pencil over to Walsh.

               THE DUKE
     Check all of these.

Walsh does a series of "tests" on the bills. Erasing. Holding 
bills up to the light. Occasionally making eye contact with 
the Duke.

               THE DUKE
     How are we doing?

               WALSH
     This one's bad.

Walsh puts it aside. The manager eyeballs their attire.

               RED
     You guys look like you've been through 
     the ringer.

               WALSH
     You don't know the half of it.
          (Looking at the Duke)
     This one's bad, too.

The Duke speaks with great urgency again.

               THE DUKE
     I want you to describe, exactly, 
     what the person who handed you this 
     bill looked like.

               CASHIER
     It was a man. About thirty. Tall.

               THE DUKE
     Oh yeah? About six feet tall?

               CASHIER
     Yeah.

               THE DUKE
     What color hair?

               CASHIER
     Brown.

               WALSH
     Sounds like our man.

               THE DUKE
          (To manager)
     I want you to call all the other 
     restaurants in the area and advise 
     them of the situation.
          (To Walsh)
     If we move fast we might be able to 
     nail him.
          (Grabbing money)
     We have to take this for evidence.
          (To Walsh)
     Make sure they get a receipt for 
     this.

Walsh scribbles a bogus receipt on a scratch pad next to the 
register. Hands it to the manager.

               WALSH
     It's as good as gold.

               THE DUKE
     What's the name of your establishment?

               RED
     Red's Corner Bar.

               THE DUKE
     Do you dye your hair?

               RED
     No.

               THE DUKE
     Why do they call you Red?

               RED
     It's short for Redwood.

               THE DUKE
     What's your first name?

               RED
     Bill.

               THE DUKE
     We'll be back. Thanks for your 
     cooperation, Bill.

EXT. RED'S CORNER BAR - DAY

Walsh and the Duke strain to maintain their poise as they 
exit the Howard Johnson's and hurry across the street into a 
7-11.

EXT. 7-11 - DAY

Walsh and the Duke can be seen through the windows inside of 
the store. In the middle of a shopping spree. Walsh stuffs 
his face as he goes for sandwiches, beer, doughnuts, etc. 
The Duke goes for fruit and cereal. They pay for their goods. 
Exit. As they walk down the street, they RIP into the bags 
like hungry dogs. They HEAR the RINGING of a railroad 
crossing. Down the street, a freight train BLOWS its WHISTLE 
as it rumbles through the center of town at fifteen miles 
per hour.

               WALSH
     Come on. We're catchin' this train.

Walsh shoves the Duke. Both carry their bags of food.

               THE DUKE
     I can't do this.

               WALSH
     You also couldn't fly. Start running.

They run alongside an open boxcar.

EXT. RED'S CORNER BAR - DAY

With a perplexed look, Red watches through the window as the 
two "FBI agents" run for the freight train.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

The Duke tosses his bag of food into it. Then hoists himself 
aboard. Walsh starts to lose his footing. He drops all of 
his food. Beer EXPLODES. Doughnuts and sandwiches go flying.

               WALSH
     Ah, shit!

EXT. RED'S CORNER BAR - DAY

Somewhat confused, Red turns and goes inside. He picks up a 
telephone. Dials.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

The train starts picking up speed. Walsh can't keep up with 
the car. The Duke does nothing to help. He just crouches and 
watches from the open boxcar.

               WALSH
     Give me your hand!

               THE DUKE
          (Sarcastically)
     Do you promise to let me go?

               WALSH
     Goddamnit, give me your hand!

The Duke doesn't budge.

               THE DUKE
     See you in the next life, Jack!

Walsh reaches out. Manages to grab onto a ladder on the side 
of the car. Hoists himself aboard.

EXT. TRAIN CARS - DAY

Walsh stretches toward the boxcar's open door. The Duke slams 
it shut. Walsh starts banging on the door.

               WALSH
          (Screaming)
     You son of a bitch! You're gonna 
     have to come out of there sometime 
     and I'm gonna be waiting here!

The train starts picking up speed. Walsh is getting unnerved.

               WALSH
     You're only making it harder on 
     yourself, making me stay out here!

After a few expectant beats, the large door slowly slides 
open, revealing an angel-eyed Duke. Walsh reaches into the 
car and pulls himself inside.

INT. BOXCAR - DAY

Walsh is completely out of breath. The boxcar is near-empty. 
As Walsh dusts himself off, the Duke sits on a couple of 
small flimsy crates stacked against the wall. Walsh walks 
over next to him. Kicks the bottom crate out with a powerful 
sideswipe. The Duke and the crates CRASH to the floor.

               WALSH
     And don't you forget it.

Walsh walks over to the far end of the boxcar and sits 
quietly. Stares down the Duke from across the car.

               WALSH
     I ain't talkin' to you for the rest 
     of this trip.

               THE DUKE
     That's adolescent. Don't you think, 
     Jack?

INT. AMARILLO POLICE STATION INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Dorfler sits at a small desk in a naked room. He's tired, 
dirty and nervous. Chain-smoking. A SHERIFF and two COPS 
enter. Dorfler rises.

               DORFLER
     Hey, are you guys gonna let me go? 
     I'm tellin' ya, I don't know anythin'.

Mosely enters. Followed by Perry, Tuttle and Plumides.

               MOSELY
     Is that a fact.

               DORFLER
     Oh, shit.

Mosely grabs Dorfler's pack of cigarettes. Takes one. Lights 
it. Pockets the pack.

               DORFLER
     Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.

               MOSELY
     Where are they?

               DORFLER
     You got me.

Mosely turns. KICKS the chair out from under Dorfler. Dorfler 
hits the floor. Perry lurches forward.

               PERRY
     Inspector...

               MOSELY
     Shut up!

Mosely picks up Dorfler. Tosses him at the table. Breaking 
it. Dorfler rolls to the floor.

               MOSELY
     I want some answers and I want them 
     now.

Mosely picks up Dorfler. Grabs the chair. Shoves him into 
it. A Sheriff enters and whispers something to Tuttle.

               DORFLER
     I don't know nothing. They went down 
     the river. They could be dead, for 
     all I know.

Tuttle meekly approaches Mosely.

               TUTTLE
     Sir?

               MOSELY
          (Snapping)
     What?

               TUTTLE
          (Whispering)
     It seems that an "Agent Alonzo Mosely" 
     and his "partner" were seen hopping 
     a westbound freight train near 
     Channing.

EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

The freight train barrels through the moonlit night.

INT. BOXCAR - NIGHT

Still at opposite ends of the car, Walsh and the Duke are 
curled up trying to resist the cold.

               THE DUKE
     C'mon, Jack. Don't be a baby. Are 
     you going to sulk the rest of the 
     trip?

Walsh doesn't answer.

               THE DUKE
     Do you want to know when I knew I 
     had you pegged?

Still no response.

               THE DUKE
     The very first second we were in the 
     car in New York. For some reason, I 
     noticed your watch. An old Timex. 
     Scratched. Cracked. But you hang on 
     to it, don't you? Even when a new 
     watch would do better by you.

The Duke speaks the truth. Suddenly Walsh appears vulnerable.

               THE DUKE
     Let me guess. It was a present. 
     Someone gave it to you about 20 years 
     ago.

Walsh doesn't answer.

               THE DUKE
     You're sentimental. You hold memories 
     as something precious. You have a 
     desire to do what's right. I knew 
     you wouldn't force me to fly.

Walsh gently looks at his watch.

               WALSH
     Gail bought me this. It was the first 
     thing she ever got me. I was always 
     a half hour late when we were dating. 
     So she bought me this watch and set 
     it a half an hour fast so I'd never 
     be late.

The Duke is silent.

               WALSH
     Somewhere in the back of my mind, I 
     still imagine that we're gonna end 
     up together. I'm still waiting. 
     Hangin' on.

               THE DUKE
     I don't think she's coming back.

               WALSH
     I don't, either.
          (A beat)
     The bitch...

INT. FRONT DESK, AMARILLO POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Dorfler is handed his belongings in a paper bag by a DESK 
SERGEANT.

               DORFLER
     Yeah. Accommodations were wonderful. 
     You gotta cigarette?

               DESK SERGEANT
     Don't smoke.

               DORFLER
     That Fed took my cigarettes.
          (Leaning in)
     Where did everybody go?

               DESK SERGEANT
     They took off.
          (Smiling)
     You want your cigarettes? You'll 
     have to go to Flagstaff.
          (Starts laughing)
     Because that's where your pal Mosely 
     went.

Dorfler laughs with him.

               DORFLER
     I just might do that.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RAILROAD TRACKS, ARIZONA - DAWN

The train moves through the Arizona desert. The sun is just 
peeking over distant mountains. The landscape is bathed in a 
deep red hue.

INT. BOXCAR - DAWN

Walsh is crouched in the open doorway, smoking. Looking at 
the sun. He flicks his cigarette butt into the wind. Walsh 
turns. Notices that the Duke is setting up his breakfast. He 
tears open the paper bag. Uses it as a place mat. Lays out 
fruit. A box of high-fiber cereal. A quart of nonfat milk.

               THE DUKE
     Jack. Would you care to breakfast 
     with me?

The Duke pulls out some packaged cakes.

               THE DUKE
     I think these are yours anyway, Jack. 
     I know I didn't buy any Ho-Ho's or 
     Suzy-Q's.

Walsh looks at the Duke's bruised face.

               WALSH
     I'm sorry I hit you.

The Duke shrugs it off. Walsh moves next to him. The Duke 
hands him the cakes.

               THE DUKE
     Do you know where we are?

               WALSH
     We've been going west all night. My 
     guess is Arizona. We're almost home.

               THE DUKE
     I'm almost dead.

               WALSH
     The witness protection program isn't 
     so bad. They'll give you a new name. 
     You'll have a new life.

               THE DUKE
     Jack, do me a favor, okay? Don't 
     play this big brother routine with 
     me because it really insults my 
     intelligence. The only thing important 
     to you about me is getting your money.

               WALSH
     I'm tired of you making me out to be 
     some kind of thug whose only concern 
     is a big chunk of change. Did you 
     know that Serrano's people offered 
     me a million bucks for you?

               THE DUKE
     Why don't you just go for the big 
     money, Jack? You're doing his work 
     for him either way.

               WALSH
     You don't know what the fuck you're 
     talking about. The reason I do this 
     shit is because I didn't want to 
     work for that lowlife. You remember 
     that big dealer I was trying to bring 
     down in Chicago? That was Serrano, 
     alright? Now, you know everything. 
     Are you happy?

               THE DUKE
     He's the reason you left Chicago? 
     And you're taking me in? Are you out 
     of your mind? You want me to speak 
     your language, Jack? You let that 
     motherfucker beat you! With what you 
     know about police work and what I 
     know about Serrano's operation, we 
     should be able to put him away for 
     thirty years.

               WALSH
     I'm not in that business anymore.

               THE DUKE
     I'm a goddamn accountant and I tried 
     to get him. You're this big macho 
     guy, with your guns and all your 
     bullshit and you're backing away?

Walsh opens himself up like he has never before.

               WALSH
     I just don't have it in me.

EXT. BOXCAR - DAY - LATER

The city of Flagstaff is in the distance. The train begins 
to slow down. Walsh leans out of the car. Eyeballing it.

               WALSH
     We're gettin' off here. Just in case.

They both get up. Wait for the right moment.

               WALSH
     You first, wise guy.

The Duke jumps. Walsh follows. They tumble through the high 
grass. Roll to a stop. Endless boxcars THUNDER past them.

INT. FLAGSTAFF TRAIN DEPOT - DAY

A few minutes later. The train is now stationary. The door 
is SWUNG OPEN. HARD.

SERIES OF CUTS

Of boxcars being opened. One after another. FEDS and COPS 
are all over the train in greater numbers than ever before. 
Mosely's car pulls up. He gets out. Perry, Tuttle and Plumides 
follow suit. Mosely approaches a Flagstaff POLICE CAPTAIN.

               MOSELY
     Inspector Mosely. Find anything?

               POLICE CAPTAIN
     Not yet.

Mosely walks away with determination. His men follow.

               PERRY
     They could have jumped off the train 
     anywhere along the line.

               MOSELY
     Walsh isn't playing with a lot of 
     time. He took this train as far as 
     he could.

EXT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Dorfler cruises over a bridge. Below him is the train depot. 
He slows and spots the slew of police cars below him. Watches 
as they continue conducting the search of the boxcars.

EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

Some pickup trucks with Arizona plates. Walsh and the Duke 
are cuffed again. Sneaking along, they approach a Jeep CJ-7 
decked for off-road use.

               WALSH
     Arizona plates. Do I know my shit or 
     what?

Walsh moves around to the passenger side of the Jeep. The 
door is unlocked. He opens it.

INT. JEEP - DAY

He proceeds to hot-wire the vehicle. The engine CRANKS and 
FIRES. Walsh pushes the Duke across the passenger side. Cuffs 
him to the roll bar. Hops in.

EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

As Walsh ROARS away, the OWNER of the Jeep exits the store. 
His jaw drops as his Jeep passes him and tears off down the 
road.

INT. JEEP - DAY

Walsh tools down the road. The Duke staring ahead. An 
occasional building passes by as they move to the outskirts 
of town. Fields and mountains ahead.

               THE DUKE
     Where are we going?

               WALSH
     To the next fuckin' airport.

A police car comes up behind him. Hits its lights. SIREN. 
Starts coming up fast.

               WALSH
     Shit!

Walsh jams it. The truck lurches with life. Suddenly, a second 
police car is moving like a bat out of hell from the opposite 
direction. Sirens WAILING. Light blazing.

               THE DUKE
     You're not going to be happy until 
     you get us both killed.

               WALSH
     I came too far. I'm too close.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

A cop car ahead skids to a stop, blocking the road. Walsh 
SCREAMS off the pavement. Driving onto the shoulder. Clods 
of earth kick up. Walsh SCRAPES the cop car and moves right 
back on to the road. The car chasing Walsh tries the same 
trick. Doesn't make it. SMACKS hard into the police car 
blocking the road.

EXT. FLAGSTAFF TRAIN DEPOT - DAY

COPS. FEDS. Everyone is running for their cars. Cars SCREECH 
out in all directions. The police captain runs up to Mosely, 
Perry, Tuttle and Plumides.

               POLICE CAPTAIN
          (Shouting)
     Follow me to the chopper!

EXT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

From the bridge, Dorfler watches the excitement unfold. He 
smiles, knowing that Walsh and the Duke must be nearby. He 
gets back into his car and follows the procession of speeding 
police and Federal cars.

INT. JEEP - DAY

Walsh has got it to the floor. They move more and more into 
the country. Dirt roads cross the plains.

               WALSH
     How many fuckin' cops can they have 
     in this town?

Walsh checks the rearview mirror. More than a dozen police 
and Federal cars are behind them. The Duke notices several 
police cars ROARING down the dirt road on their right. Walsh 
turns. At least a dozen more are on his left. They seem to 
be coming from everywhere.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Walsh tears by. The cop cars from the right and left sides 
converge onto Walsh's road. The two dented cop cars from 
behind come up fast in pursuit. It's a carnival of SIRENS 
and BLAZING LIGHTS.

INT. JEEP - DAY

               THE DUKE
     I know you can do it, Jack!

Walsh spots the worst sight yet. A slew of Federal cars coming 
at him from ahead. He's surrounded. There's no way he's 
getting around this. He turns the wheel hard.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The Jeep skids off the road. SMASHES through fence posts. 
Rips into the field. Jumps a hill. Lands and keeps going. 
The Cops and Feds swerve off the road in pursuit.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Dorfler slows, as his car passes the spot where Walsh crashed 
through the fence. The place is crawling with Cops and Feds. 
Cautious not to be observed, he keeps moving.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Walsh shifts it into four-wheel-drive. SLAMS up a hill. 
Missing trees. Rocks. The cop cars can't keep up. A helicopter 
ROARS overhead.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Mosely sits alongside the PILOT. Looking down at the terrain 
with binoculars. Behind him sits Perry, Tuttle and Plumides. 
Below, the fields are filled with the tangle of police and 
Federal cars. The hill approaches. Mosely taps the pilot.

               MOSELY
          (To pilot)
     Check the other side.

EXT. HILL - DAY

The Jeep ROARS over the peak. Starts bouncing down the other 
side. It's very steep. PLOWING through brush. Picking up 
speed. A group of farmhouses are clustered below.

INT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Dorfler follows the chopper with his eyes as it heads for 
the group of hills. The chopper obviously has an overview so 
Dorfler decides to follow it.

EXT. FARM ROAD - DAY

Dorfler makes a turn onto a dirt road, ROARING past the group 
of farmhouses. Slows. Checks the position of the helicopter, 
then keeps moving.

INT. JEEP - DAY

Coming down a hill, Walsh realizes he's not going to make 
it. He loses control of the Jeep.

EXT. HILL - DAY

The Jeep SKIDS. SLAMS sideways into a group of trees. Walsh 
climbs out. Uncuffs the Duke from the roll bar. They start 
running for the farmhouses. The chopper is coming. They drop 
into the high grass. The chopper moves past them. Back toward 
the hill.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Mosely, with eagle eyes, spots something.

               MOSELY
     There's the Jeep.

It's nearly buried in trees and brush.

               MOSELY
          (To Pilot)
     Try the farm. Close to the ground.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The chopper moves toward the farmhouses. Walsh and the Duke 
move through the high grass to a thicket of trees on the 
roadside. Two Federal cars ROAR past them. Followed by two 
local cop cars. Walsh's eyes sweep the road. Next is a 
passenger car. One person at the wheel. Walsh grabs his .45. 
Runs into the road. Flags down the car. The Duke recognizes 
the driver.

               THE DUKE
     Jack! Don't! It's Dorfler!

INT. MARVIN DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

Dorfler, at the wheel, can't believe what he sees. There is 
a God. He floors it. Heads for Walsh. Opens the car door. 
WHACKS him. Walsh bounces to the concrete. Dorfler gets out. 
The Duke starts running for the woods.

EXT. CREEK - DAY

It looks like paradise. A trickling creek. Surrounded by 
aspens. Sunlight streaming down. The Duke slides down the 
embankment. SPLASHES through the creek. Dorfler follows him. 
Chasing hard. Tackles him. Lands several punches. The Duke 
swings back. Dorfler overpowers him. Pins him into the creek. 
Lands several more punches. Yanks him to his feet.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Walsh is slowly coming around. Winded. Bruised. Dorfler yanks 
the Duke up the embankment. Across the road. Quickly opens 
the trunk. Shoves the Duke inside. SLAMS the trunk closed. 
An uncomprehending Walsh takes a feeble swing at Dorfler. 
Dorfler right-hooks Walsh. Walsh stumbles. Dorfler hits him 
again. Walsh falls backwards, several feet, over the 
embankment.

EXT. CREEK - DAY

Walsh tumbles down the embankment to the banks of the creek. 
He's out cold. Dorfler can be heard SCREECHING away in the 
car. Walsh is still. The continuous roar of the chopper seems 
to fade away. He slowly comes to. Looks at the creek before 
him. Slightly confounded at finding himself in such a heavenly 
setting. Stares at clear water TRICKLING over rocks and stone.

EXT. EAT DINER - SUNSET

A gentle cut. Peaceful. Almost dream-like. Wind gently rocks 
the "EAT" sign. Its rusty hinges SQUEAK. The dirt parking 
lot is empty. Walsh moves down the road. Approaches the diner.

INT. EAT DINER - SUNSET

Walsh enters. Dirty. Ragged. The DINNER OWNER, a quiet 
matronly woman, is behind the counter. Walsh moves over to 
her. She barely moves. Just checks him out.

               DINER OWNER
     Bad day, huh?

               WALSH
     Bad week.

               DINER OWNER
     I know what you mean.

               WALSH
     I could use a cup of coffee.

               DINER OWNER
     I think I could arrange that.

He achingly sits at the counter. The Diner Owner places a 
mug before Walsh. Pours coffee. Walsh nods his thanks. Picks 
up the mug. Blows on it gently. Is about to take a sip. 
SUDDENLY, a pair of sunglasses SLIDES the length of the 
counter, coming to rest in front of Walsh. He doesn't budge. 
Just stares at them. He puts down the mug. Picks up the 
sunglasses. Knows what's coming without looking. He looks 
anyway. Standing at the end of the counter is Mosely.

               WALSH
     I've been lookin' all over for these.

Walsh turns. Through the window, in the lot, are twenty police 
cars. Federal cars. Lights turning. Police RADIOS gently 
BLABBERING.

EXT. FLAGSTAFF AIRPORT - DAY

Dorfler and the Duke pull up to the small airport.

INT. DORFLER'S CAR - DAY

The Duke eyes the planes on the runway. Turns to Dorfler.

               THE DUKE
     I can't do this. I have a very serious 
     fear of flying.

Without losing a beat, Dorfler right-hooks the Duke.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. FLAGSTAFF POLICE DEPT. - NIGHT

Walsh is on the hot seat. Smoking. Mosely sits opposite him. 
Perry, Tuttle and Plumides stand around Walsh. Also several 
high-ranking LOCAL COPS. Walsh glances at his watch. It's a 
quarter to seven.

               MOSELY
     Forget about your time clock, Walsh. 
     It's over. That's how that one went.

               WALSH
     I know my rights. You owe me some 
     phone calls.

               MOSELY
     What should be of paramount importance 
     to you, right now, is the ten years 
     you're going to get for impersonating 
     a Federal agent.

               WALSH
     Ten years for impersonating a Fed? 
     How come no one's after you?

               MOSELY
     You don't know when to quit.

               WALSH
     I know one thing. I know my rights. 
     And by law, you owe me phone calls. 
     I ain't sayin' shit 'til I get them.

Mosely gives in.

               MOSELY
     Give him his calls.

Perry and two local cops escort Walsh out of the room.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - FLAGSTAFF POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Crowded with cops and Feds. Walsh dials. Waits.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Jerry grabs the phone.

               JERRY
     Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE'S OFFICE

               WALSH
     It's Walsh. Give me Moscone.

Jerry nearly drops the phone. He turns.

               JERRY
     Eddie. Pick it up. It's Jack!

Moscone rushes for the phone. Picks it up. Nervous as hell. 
Jerry listens on the extension as usual.

               MOSCONE
     I hope you're gettin' close, 'cause 
     you only got five hours.

               WALSH
     No, I'm not, Eddie. But, I'm callin' 
     to let you know that you're a dead 
     man, you lying son of a bitch. You 
     put Dorfler on this fuckin' thing...

Moscone's nervousness turns to rage.

               MOSCONE
     Well, I should kill you. You stupid 
     son of a bitch! You had the guy five 
     days ago. What the hell are you 
     joyridin' cross-country for? And are 
     you nuts, tellin' Dorfler that I was 
     givin' you a hundred grand when I 
     offered him twenty-five? He just 
     called me up yellin' and screamin'. 
     And why the hell can't you get the 
     Duke here in five hours?

               WALSH
          (Confused)
     When did you speak to Dorfler?

               MOSCONE
     Five minutes ago. He told me to go 
     fuck myself. What the hell difference 
     does it make?

RESUME WALSH

Moscone continues yelling. Walsh slowly lowers the phone, 
hanging it up on Moscone. He thinks. It doesn't make sense. 
His wheels are turning. Then he quickly reaches into his 
wallet. Pulls out the slip of paper that Tony and Joey gave 
him in New York. The card is stained from the adventure in 
the rapids. Numbers have faded. But it's still there. Walsh 
dials it. It's a million-to-one shot. Someone picks up on 
the other end.

               MALE VOICE (V.O.)
     Hello?

               WALSH
          (Slowly)
     Yeah. Is Tony or Joey there?

               MALE VOICE (V.O.)
     Who's this?

Walsh thinks for a second. It's a million-to-one shot...

               WALSH
     Dorfler.

The voice relaxes.

               MALE VOICE (V.O.)
     Sure, Marvin, hang on. I'm gonna 
     forward your call.

Walsh's heart rate goes up. Dorfler's gone dirty.

INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Joey picks up the phone.

               JOEY
          (Into phone)
     Marvin?

INTERCUT AS NEEDED Walsh's eyes widen. He recognizes the 
voice.

               WALSH
     No, it's Jack Walsh. So, Dorfler's 
     workin' for you guys now.

               JOEY
     What are you complainin' for? We 
     came to you first.

Tony comes out of the bathroom. Joey turns and covers the 
phone.

               JOEY
     It's Jack Walsh.

Tony takes the phone.

               DARUVO
     Hey, too late scumbag...

               WALSH
     No, too late for you. I didn't come 
     this far not to collect my money. I 
     want the Duke back.

               DARUVO
     So what the fuck are you telling me 
     for?

               WALSH
     What am I telling you for? Because 
     I've got some of the Duke's 
     belongings, that's why. Including 
     some computer disks that have every 
     last detail of Serrano's businesses 
     and money-laundering operations, and 
     if I don't get him back in the next 
     two hours I'm gonna turn them over 
     to the Feds.

               DARUVO
     I'll blow your fuckin' brains out.

               WALSH
     How are you gonna do that from jail?

Tony doesn't answer.

               WALSH
     You tell Serrano, I wanna meet him 
     with the Duke alone in two hours, in 
     the main terminal of McCarran Airport, 
     where we'll make the exchange. I 
     know he's the only one of you guys 
     who won't try to take a shot at me 
     in a public place. If I see one single 
     goon within a mile of that airport, 
     the deal's off and I'm goin' to the 
     Feds.

               DARUVO
     I ain't gonna tell him that.

               WALSH
     Fine. After he's busted I'll make 
     sure to tell him you knew about it 
     beforehand. That's two hours from 
     now. Main terminal, McCarran Airport. 
     You got that, moron? Have a nice 
     day.

Walsh hangs up, wondering how he's going to dig himself out 
of this. The SOUNDS of the police station come back to him. 
He turns, locks eyes with Perry.

               PERRY
     What was that?

               WALSH
     Where's Mosely? I wanna make a deal.

               PERRY
          (Calling)
     Inspector!

Mosely moves through the cops. Comes up to Walsh.

               WALSH
     What would you do if I could deliver 
     you Serrano?

               MOSELY
     How do you mean "deliver"?

               WALSH
     Well... for starters, conspiracy to 
     destroy government evidence.

               MOSELY
     What government evidence?

               WALSH
     Would you let me take the Duke in 
     myself and collect my money?

Mosely can see that Walsh is serious.

               MOSELY
     Tell me more.

               WALSH
     Well, I'll have to tell you on the 
     way because we've got to be in Las 
     Vegas in two hours.

EXT. GOLDEN BOY MOTEL - NIGHT

Dorfler scurries with a newspaper and paper bag toward the 
motel.

INT. ROOM - GOLDEN BOY MOTEL - NIGHT

Dorfler enters. Tears open the bag. Opens a package containing 
a new Polaroid Camera. Slams in package of film. Flashbulbs. 
With the newspaper under his arm, he heads for the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Duke is cuffed to the pipe under the sink. Dorfler forces 
the Duke to hold up the paper.

               DORFLER
     Hold that up. So they'll know that I 
     took these today. See? I got it all 
     figured out. Say "cheese."

Dorfler starts snapping off pictures.

               THE DUKE
     Don't do this, Marvin.

Dorfler scoops the images off the tile floor. They're coming 
to life. He pockets them.

               DORFLER
     Adiós.

Dorfler exits. The Duke can HEAR him leave.

EXT. GULF STREAM JET - NIGHT

The FBI Gulf Stream jet flies above the desert bathed in 
moonlight.

INT. GULF STREAM JET - NIGHT

Mosely and his men listen to Walsh.

               PERRY
     If he takes those disks, even though 
     they're blank, that's the overt act, 
     correct?

Mosely is about to answer. Walsh cuts him off.

               WALSH
     If he just sets foot in the airport, 
     he's committed an overt act. 
     Conspiracy to obstruct justice.

The agents listen attentively.

               WALSH
     If he shows up with the Duke, you 
     can add kidnapping. If he shows up 
     with anyone packing a gun, you can 
     add conspiracy to commit murder. The 
     fact that it's an airport... Alonzo, 
     correct me if you think I'm wrong 
     here...
          (Back to Perry)
     ...you can slap an ITAR rap on him 
     as well.

               PERRY
     Do you think he'll show?

               WALSH
     Oh, he'll show. He's got no choice.

Mosely is impressed.

               MOSELY
          (To Perry re: Walsh)
     Get a wire on him.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lights of Las Vegas twinkle in the distance. Dorfler's 
car swings into the lot. He looks around. Still sporting 
their bruises, Tony and Joey get out of their car and move 
toward him.

               DARUVO
     Marvin?

               DORFLER
     Yeah.
          (A beat)
     Hey, look I'm sorry about what 
     happened back at the Western Union 
     office. You can imagine my 
     embarrassment when I found out who 
     you were. I didn't mean to hit you. 
     It was just one of those things. You 
     know. Like a spur of the moment. You 
     know I'd never pull any shit like 
     that.

               JOEY
     What the fuck took you?

               DORFLER
     I made a quick stop.

               DARUVO
          (Looking around)
     Where is he?

               DORFLER
     Where's my money?

               DARUVO
     It's in the car. Where is he?

               DORFLER
     Slight change of plans. Now I want 
     two million dollars. I read the 
     newspapers, ya know. This guy got 
     you for fifteen million. So I figured 
     he's gotta be worth at least two to 
     ya. You can't play me for a chump.

               DARUVO
          (Holding back rage)
     How do we know you've got him?

Dorfler reaches into his shirt pocket. Hands over the 
Polaroids. Tony starts slipping through them. Joey leans in.

               DORFLER
     A million now. Then I call you in 
     twenty minutes. Tell you where to 
     drop off the second million. Once I 
     know it's there, I tell you where he 
     is.

Tony stops flipping through the photos. Pushes Joey aside.

               DORFLER
     Okay?

               JOEY
     Not okay.

               DORFLER
     Why not?

Tony rears back and BAM! Marvin is out cold.

               JOEY
     Whatayou fucking nuts! What's Jimmy 
     gonna say!?! How the fuck are we 
     gonna get the Duke now!?!

               DARUVO
     You got the answer right in your 
     hands!

               JOEY
     What are you talking about?

Tony shows the Polaroids to Joey.

               DARUVO
     Joey, when are you going to learn 
     how to pay attention?

INSERT POLAROID The Duke is cuffed to the sink. Holding the 
paper. Several motel towels with the "Golden Boy" logo 
decorate the bathroom.

               DARUVO
     Look, see what it says there?

RESUME SCENE Tony and Joey head back for their car.

INT. SERRANO'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Serrano gives instructions to a few BODYGUARDS. Lyman paces 
nervously.

               SERRANO
     I want ten of our best people and I 
     don't want any fuck-ups this time. 
     As soon as I get ahold of these 
     things, I want them both dropped.

               LYMAN
     I don't think you should do this.

A bodyguard helps Serrano with his coat.

               SERRANO
     Oh, you don't? What do you propose I 
     do?

               LYMAN
     Send somebody with a cash offer. 
     Give this guy whatever the hell he 
     wants but don't do this.

               SERRANO
     Walsh won't take any money from me. 
     He knows I'd come and get it an hour 
     later. In his mind this is clean. He 
     gets what he wants. I get what I 
     want. The guy's a fuckin' burnout. 
     He just wants his money.

               LYMAN
     Jimmy, listen...

Serrano turns and heads for the door with his goons.

               SERRANO
     Sydney. Sit down. Relax. Have a 
     sandwich. Drink a glass of milk. Do 
     some fucking thing.

INT. STARLIGHT CASINO GARAGE - NIGHT

The elevator doors open revealing Serrano, the four bodyguards 
with him. They move with purpose, almost in step, heading 
for Serrano's limousine. FBI agents watch them as they pass 
and then one AGENT turns, picking up a walkie-talkie.

               FBI AGENT
     He's on his way.

Serrano's limousine pulls out and moves up to street level.

EXT. VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

The limousine moves into traffic. Suddenly two FBI cars, one 
parked at the curb, the other from the front of the casino, 
come to life and move off in pursuit. As Serrano's limousine 
passes a cross street, another FBI car makes a U-turn as if 
from nowhere and joins in the surveillance.

INT. FBI CAR - NIGHT

Four AGENTS. One speaks into the radio.

               AGENT
     We're on him.

INT. GULF STREAM JET - NIGHT

They approach the lights of Vegas. Everyone is strapping in. 
Perry is checking the wire Walsh is wearing. Plumides lights 
Walsh's cigarette. Mosely talks into a speakerphone.

               MOSELY
     This is Mosely.

               AGENT (V.O.)
     Serrano's just left and is heading 
     west on Vegas Boulevard.

Walsh smiles. Mosely notices.

               MOSELY
     Why are you smiling?

               WALSH
     I feel like a cop again.

EXT. GULF STREAM JET - NIGHT

The Gulf Stream jet touches down and THUNDERS toward the far 
end of the airport, roaring to a stop. Mosely, Perry, Tuttle, 
Plumides and Walsh descend the steps of the Gulf Stream jet. 
Several FBI and police cars are discreetly parked nearby. 
Walsh is directed by the agents toward the main terminal.

EXT. MCCARRAN AIRPORT - NIGHT

Serrano's limo pulls up in front, followed by the FBI cars 
which duck out of sight. Serrano gets out of his limo and 
walks to another limo, parked at the curb. Serrano gets in.

INT. LIMO - NIGHT

Serrano gets into the limo. Inside are the Duke, Tony and 
Joey. Serrano leans back and smiles at the Duke.

               SERRANO
     So we finally meet. I'm in the 
     presence of greatness. "The Duke." A 
     man who robs from the scum of the 
     earth and gives to the unfortunates 
     of the world. I wanted to meet you 
     face-to-face.

Serrano leans forward.

               SERRANO
     Did you actually think that you were 
     going to steal my money and get away 
     with it? I stopped by here to tell 
     you two things. Number one is that 
     you're going to die tonight. Number 
     two, I'm going to go home, have a 
     nice hot meal, then find your wife 
     and I'm going to kill her too.

Serrano leans in and smacks the Duke across the face.

EXT. LIMO - NIGHT

Some of Serrano's thugs hover around the limo. Serrano and 
Joey get out of the limo.

               SERRANO
     Joey, stay here and wait for my call. 
     The rest of you come with me.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Walsh walks through the crowded terminal. He moves from one 
of the arms of McCarran to the gorgeous glass main terminal. 
His eyes scan the place. No agents in sight. No sign of 
Serrano or the Duke. Walsh crosses the terminal, heading for 
the center where he can be clearly seen. A few of Serrano's 
BODYGUARDS enter, glance at Walsh, fan out into the crowd. 
Walsh pulls the last cigarette out of a pack and lights it.

INT. TERMINAL BALCONY - NIGHT

Agent Mosely and the other FBI agents look through binoculars 
down at Walsh. They also listen in on the wire. Suddenly, 
Serrano comes into sight of one of the FBI agents.

               FBI AGENT
     Here he comes.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Walsh stops in his tracks as he sees Serrano walking toward 
him. Serrano looks at Walsh's ragged appearance.

               SERRANO
     Jack, long time no see.

               WALSH
     Long time no see.

               SERRANO
     I see you're still spending all of 
     your money on clothes.

               WALSH
     Well, you know...

               SERRANO
     Listen, while you're in town, if 
     you'll want to see a show... or a 
     free meal or something like that, 
     you let me know. On me. That's just 
     the type of guy I am.

               WALSH
     You're a real sport.

INT. TERMINAL BALCONY - NIGHT

Mosely and the other agents continue watching Walsh and 
Serrano.

               MOSELY
     Just give him the disks.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

               SERRANO
     How's your mother?

               WALSH
     She's alright.

               SERRANO
     Daughter's getting big... growing up 
     and all, huh?

Walsh nods his head and stares at Serrano.

               SERRANO
     You know I was thinking, maybe if 
     we'd done business way back when, 
     you wouldn't look like a guy with a 
     fucking cup in your hand.

               WALSH
     Trying to make a living.

               SERRANO
     You got the disks or did you lose 
     them too? Like your job.

INT. TERMINAL BALCONY - NIGHT

               MOSELY
     Give him the disks, Walsh.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

               WALSH
     Well, I see you but I don't see the 
     Duke.

               SERRANO
     We'll worry about him in a minute.

               WALSH
     No, we have to worry about him now. 
     This isn't a fucking reunion. If I 
     don't see him in five seconds, I'm 
     walking.

               SERRANO
     You're still way too serious. Why 
     don't we take a walk together and go 
     get him.

               WALSH
     Fuck you. See you at the arraignment.

Jack starts to walk. Serrano calls out to him.

               SERRANO
     Alright, Jack. Hold up. You win.

Serrano nods to a gun by a phone. The goon nods back and 
places a call.

Walsh is pissed.

               WALSH
     I said no goons.

               SERRANO
     Don't worry about him. You're going 
     to get what you want.

ANGLE ON COUNTER

Dorfler, complete with back eye, moves up to the counter.

               DORFLER
     One-way ticket to L.A.

               TICKET CLERK
     Smoking or nonsmoking?

Dorfler lights up a cigarette and blows the smoke at the 
clerk.

               DORFLER
     Take a wild guess.

Suddenly, Dorfler turns and spots Tony and Joey walking right 
past him with the Duke. Dorfler does a double-take. He grabs 
his .45 out of his duffelbag. Puts it in his pocket and moves 
after them.

INT. TERMINAL BALCONY - NIGHT

Perry sees Dorfler coming.

               PERRY
     Ah, shit...

Now, Mosely sees Dorfler coming.

               MOSELY
     I'm going to have a heart attack 
     before this is over...

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Tony and Joey appear with the Duke. Walsh motions for the 
Duke to get behind him.

               SERRANO
     Give me the disks.

Dorfler appears.

               WALSH
     Ah fuck... Marvin, take a hike.

               DORFLER
     No way!

Dorfler pulls out the .45 and begins tugging at the Duke.

               WALSH
     You're missing the bigger picture 
     here, Marvin.

Dorfler grabs at Walsh.

INT. TERMINAL BALCONY - NIGHT

Walsh's wire goes dead. Agent Tuttle looks up.

               TUTTLE
     The wire's gone dead.

INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT

Serrano grabs the disks and moves off with Tony and Joey. 
The goons begin to approach. They're all clearly armed. Walsh 
sees them coming.

               WALSH
     Marvin! Watch out, watch out!

               DORFLER
     I'm not falling for that shit again.

               WALSH
     Will you look out!

Walsh leans into his jacket.

               WALSH
          (Into jacket)
     He's got the disks. He's got the 
     disks.

Walsh turns to the balcony and yells out.

               WALSH
     Serrano's got the disk! Serrano's 
     got the disk!

Feds move in from everywhere. They grab Serrano, Tony, Joey 
and Dorfler. There are nearly a hundred Federal agents that 
continue swarming in. Walsh moves over to Serrano with a big 
smile.

               WALSH
     You know, there's something I've 
     been wanting to say to you for ten 
     years.

               SERRANO
     Oh, yeah? What's that?

               WALSH
     You're under arrest.

Mosely appears with Perry and Tuttle.

               WALSH
     We still have a deal, Alonzo?

               MOSELY
     We have a deal.

Dorfler is being taken away by the Feds. He shouts out.

               DORFLER
     Why does he get special treatment?

               WALSH
     See you in L.A., Marvin.

               DORFLER
     Watch your cigarettes with this guy, 
     Jack.

Dorfler is taken away. Walsh cuffs the Duke.

               THE DUKE
     What are you doing?

               WALSH
     We've still got an hour and a half 
     to get you to L.A.

Walsh leads the uncomprehending Duke away through the crowd 
of Federal agents and spectators.

INT. 727 JET - NIGHT

Walsh and the Duke, both deep in thought, sit quietly as the 
plane approaches L.A.

POV OF 727 - NIGHT

The Los Angeles skyline beckons. The runway lights are 
approaching. It has a dream-like quality. Jet engines WHINE. 
The runway swallows up the SCREEN. The plane TOUCHES down.

INT. WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - NIGHT

Looking like the absolute ends of the earth, Walsh and the 
Duke shuffle out of the boarding ramp to the upstairs 
terminal. Walsh slips the cuffs around the Duke's wrist. 
They cross the terminal and move quietly.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS TERMINAL - NIGHT

Walsh and the Duke ride the escalator down. They move toward 
the front door. Walsh stops near a bank of pay phones. Turns 
to the Duke.

               WALSH
     When I took this job, I figured I'd 
     never make it. Not in a million years. 
     But for a hundred grand, I had to 
     give it a try.
          (A beat)
     If you had your way, what would you 
     do? Where would you go?

               THE DUKE
     Mexico. Call Dana, my wife. Have her 
     collect whatever money we've got 
     stashed. Meet me in Mazatlán. Nobody 
     would bother us and we'd live well 
     down there.

               WALSH
     Drink margaritas and watch the sun 
     go down?

               THE DUKE
     Every single night.

Walsh starts to punch a number into a pay phone.

               WALSH
     That coffee shop would've been nice.

INT. MOSCONE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The phone is ringing. Moscone picks it up. He is alone.

               MOSCONE
     Eddie Moscone, bail bondsman.

INTERCUT WALSH AND MOSCONE

               WALSH
     Hey, Eddie, where's Jerry?

               MOSCONE
     The Feds picked him up twenty minutes 
     ago.

               WALSH
     What for?

               MOSCONE
     What's the difference? I never trusted 
     that guy. Where the hell are you?

               WALSH
     I'm in L.A. with the Duke. You want 
     to say hello?

Walsh puts the phone to the Duke's face.

               THE DUKE
     Hello.

               WALSH
          (Taking back phone)
     Now, say good-bye you lying piece of 
     shit because I'm letting him go.

Walsh hangs up. The terminal VIBRATES with the SOUND of a 
JET THUNDERING down. Walsh unlocks the cuffs.

               WALSH
     May your footsteps be heard in heaven 
     before the devil knows you're gone.

               THE DUKE
     I don't get it.

               WALSH
     I did what I wanted to do. I got you 
     to L.A. before midnight.

The Duke looks deeply at Walsh. A lot is said in the silence.

               THE DUKE
     I don't know what to say.

               WALSH
     Don't say anything. Get out of here 
     before I change my mind.

               THE DUKE
     Thank you.

               WALSH
     No, John. Thank you.

Walsh turns and starts walking. He gets a few steps toward 
the door. He stops. Turns. Looks back at the Duke, who's 
still standing in the terminal. Walsh starts walking back to 
him with a smile. He takes the Duke's hand. It appears as if 
he is going to cuff the Duke again. He does. With his battered 
Timex.

               WALSH
     Remember our adventure.

The Duke strokes the watch and smiles.

               THE DUKE
     I'll treasure it.
          (A beat)
     I've got a gift for you too, Jack.

The Duke unbuttons his suit jacket. Walsh squints. He's 
confused. The Duke unbuttons two buttons on his shirt. Reaches 
underneath. UNSTRAPS something. Pulls out an odd-looking 
belt and hands it to Walsh.

               WALSH
     What's that?

               THE DUKE
     When we first met, I was packing to 
     make my getaway because...
          (Smiling)
     ...I thought the FBI was closing in. 
     So I took a little traveling money.

It is a money belt. Walsh takes it slowly. He's slow to 
understand. He opens a compartment. Thousand dollar bills 
are stacked tightly.

               WALSH
     You sonofabitch...

               THE DUKE
     I told you I had money.

               WALSH
     I know you had money. I didn't know 
     you had money.

               THE DUKE
     It's not a payoff, it's a gift. You 
     already let me go.

Walsh smiles. Wiggles the belt.

               WALSH
     How much is here?

               THE DUKE
     In the neighborhood of three hundred 
     thousand.

               WALSH
     That's one of my favorite 
     neighborhoods.

               THE DUKE
     Take care, Jack. If you're ever in 
     Mazatlán...

               WALSH
     Yeah, John. I'll look you up. Just 
     get rid of that dog of yours.

They shake hands. Walsh turns. Walks out of the terminal 
quickly. The Duke watches him go, then disappears into another 
part of the terminal.

EXT. WESTERN AIRLINES TERMINAL - NIGHT

Money belt in hand, Walsh steps outside. Takes in the night 
air. He walks past a large clock. It reads 11:35.

               WALSH
     Twenty-five minutes to midnight, 
     Walsh. You would've made it.

Looking like shit, he walks up to the first cab parked at 
the curb. A CAB DRIVER sits inside.

               WALSH
     You got change of a thousand?

               CAB DRIVER
     Get outta here, you bum!

               WALSH
          (Smiling)
     Looks like I'm walking.

MUSIC kicks in.

FADE TO BLACK ROLL CREDITS
