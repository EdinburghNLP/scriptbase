The carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth, tormented by the temptations of demons, the guilt of making crosses for the Romans, pity for men and the world, and the constant call of God, sets out to find what God wills for Him.
But as His mission nears fulfillment, He must face the greatest temptation; the normal life of a good man.
Based, not on the Gospels, but on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same name.
