Taylor and two other astronauts come out of deep hibernation to find that their ship has crashed.
Escaping with little more than clothes they find that they have landed on a planet where men are pre-lingual and uncivilized while apes have learned speech and technology.
Taylor is captured and taken to the city of the apes after damaging his throat so that he is silent and cannot communicate with the apes.
