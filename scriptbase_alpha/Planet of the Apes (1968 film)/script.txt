FADE IN

1     EXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT

Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space.
The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger
than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.

A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen.
No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-
tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR
the voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.

          ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     So ends my last signal until we reach
     our destination. We are now on automatic,
     a mere hundred and five light years from
     our base ... and at the mercy of com-
     puters. I've tucked in my crew for the
     long sleep. I'll join them presently.

2     INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the
President's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console
of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs
is occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder
amidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin
is obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating
     from a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a
     microphone.

          ASTRONAUT
     Within the hour we shall complete
     the sixth month of our flight from
     Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is ...

He pauses, looking up at:

3     TWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL

One clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has
twenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.

The other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a
     tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.

The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.
     Over this we hear:

          ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of
     time in a vehicle traveling at close to
     the speed of light, old Mother Earth has
     aged a few thousand years since our de-
     parture -- while we have scarcely aged
     at all.

4     CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT

This is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and
     comfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of
a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then
     continues:

          TAYLOR
     It may be so. This much is probable: the
     men who sent us on this journey have long
     since been moldering in forgotten graves;
     and those, if any, who read this message
     are a different breed. Hopefully, a
     better one.

He begins to roll up his left sleeve.

          TAYLOR
     I leave the twentieth century without
     regret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said
     'Modern man is the missin 'a link between
     the ape and the human being.'

He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one
of the portholes into the astral night.

          TAYLOR
     One final thought -- nothing scientific,
     purely personal. Seen from up here,
     everything looks different ... Time bends
     and space is boundless. It squashes a
     man's ego. He begins to feel like no more
     than a mote in the eye of eternity. And
     he is nagged by a question: ahat if any-
     thing, will greet us on the end of man's
     first journey to a star? Are we to believe
     that throughout these thousands of galaxies,
     these millions of stars, only one, that
     speck of solar dust we call Earth, has
     been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?
          (pause)
     I have to doubt it.

He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects
it into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.

          TAYLOR
          (sardonically)
     That's about all. I wonder if Man, that
     marvel of the universe, that glorious
     paradox who has sent me to the unknown...
     still makes war against his brother., and
     lets his neighbor's children starve.

Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in
a drawer of the console.

          TAYLOR
     Well then, Earthmen: A missing link
     salutes you. Bless you, my descendants.

Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the
     hypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and
looks up again at:

5     THE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME

The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per
second. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.

6     INT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR

Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness,
for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after
section without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now
see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor
looks down at them.

7-     SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
10
One of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE,
LANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and
Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart
is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed
and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make
them so alive.

11     ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into
     it. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid
     shut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies
     back, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.
     His eyes are open. He seems serene, even enraptured.


(NOTE: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to
     convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of
     time.)

                    DISSOLVE TO:

12-     A SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)
16
We see a strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a
small area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and
     looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of
     descent.

The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much
     of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be
     cratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow
     "green belts" and a patch of blue water.

In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it
     would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand
     feet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a
vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is
blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell
     location, at Lone Rock.)

17     INT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY

Four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in
b.g. We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND
as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then, a
great CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact.
     Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin
     aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four
glass caskets. There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass
domes of the caskets swing open automatically.

18     CLOSE ON TAYLOR

He now has a full beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert, he
rises to a sitting position, gazing across at:

19     DODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

They, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor. They, too, are
bearded.

          TAYLOR'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     You all right?

They nod.

20     BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

He glances at the casket beside his own.

          TAYLOR
     Stewart?
          (struggling to his feet)
     Stewart?

21     CLOSE-SHOT --THE FOURTH CASKET

Its dome remains unopened. The young woman is a skeleton in a
Churchill suit.

22     REACTION SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

Dodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull
of their dead comrade. A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.
     Simultaneously the lights begin to FADE. A moment later they brighten,
     but not as much as before.

          TAYLOR
     There goes our primary power. We're on
     auxilliary.

A slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:

23     REVERSE ANGLE - THE FORWARD CABIN

A trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the
     cabin. Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.

24     LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

water

The porthole is no more than six inches above the line. In the
distance we discern a shoreline of red desert.

          TAYLOR'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     We're in the soup. We're sinking.

25     INT. CABIN - FULL SHOT

The leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. Taylor
turns away from the porthole, calling:

          TAYLOR
     Dodge! Read the atmosphere!

Dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and
mounts it. Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward
     the console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's
skeleton.

          TAYLOR
     Landon! Send a last signal.

          LANDON
          (dazed)
     What signal?

          TAYLOR
     To Earth! That we've landed!

As Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.

                    CUT TO:

26     EXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE
     ROCK, LAKE POWELL)

We are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.
     There is no sign of vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body
of water that could be the bay of an inland sea. The deep blue of the
     sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. CAMERA HOLDS
     on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred
     yards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and
     only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The
     red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.

Suddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is
located amidships.

27     INT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH

Dodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges
to the end of the snorkel tube. He reads the dials, removes the kit,
     sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:

          DODGE
     It's breathable.

          TAYLOR'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Okay! Blow the hatch before we lose
     auxilliary power.

Dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.

28     CLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON

The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing.
The LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While
Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder
     rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.

          LANDON
     It's no use ... there she goes.

          TAYLOR
     Forget it. Abandon ship.

29     WIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN

The escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and
     passes a folded life raft up to Dodge. When Landon reaches the ladder,
     Taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs
through the escape hatch. Taylor is about to follow with a third
     rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:

30     THE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

Both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF
TIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked
EARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.

31     EXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT

Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and
tosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and
climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips
into the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to
paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and
takes a sample of the water.

32     CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

          DODGE
          (half to himself)
     Briny...twenty-five percent salinity.
     Near the saturation point.

          LANDON
          (looking back)
     She's still sinking...

33     THE SPACESHIP - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

Only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.

          LANDON'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Going ... going...

     The craft vanishes beneath the water.

34     CLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

Dodge is still busy with his kit. Landon is still looking back, but
Taylor doesn't bother to turn his head.

          LANDON
     Gone.

          TAYLOR
          (flatly)
     We're here to stay.

35     ANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING WITH THE RAFT

They gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the
     shore.

          LANDON
     Well? Where are we? Have any notion,
     skipper?

          TAYLOR
          (confidently)
     We're some three hundred and twenty
     light years from Earth. On an unnamed
     planet in orbit around a star in the
     constellation of Orion.
          (looks off at
          the "sun")
     That could be Bellatrix.

36     THE SUN - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

Low on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles.

          DODGE'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Too red for Bellatrix.

37     BACK TO ASTRONAUTS IN RAFT

Landon glances skeptically at Taylor.

          LANDON
     You didn't have time to check the
     tapes, so you don't really know,
     do you?
          (as Taylor ignores
          him)
     What went wrong?
          (sardonically)
     We weren't programmed to land
     in water.

          DODGE
          (grinning)
     The question, Landon, is not so much
     where we are as when we are.

          TAYLOR
     (stands up in raft)
     We've had a nice snooze. Let's start
     earning all our back pay.

38     WIDER ANGLE - THE BEACH

As the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the
raft ashore.

          TAYLOR
     Take your soil test, Dodge. I'll
     check the equipment.

Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill
from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins
to take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents
of the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around
his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and
succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific
inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous
and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while
Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.

          TAYLOR
          (calls Dodge)
     Got your sensors?

          DODGE
     Yo!

          TAYLOR
     Geiger counter?

          DODGE
     Yo!

          TAYLOR
          (taking inventory)
     One pistol... twenty-four rounds of
     ammo. two medical kits.. one camera...
     one TX9.
          (loudly to the
          others)
     We've enough food and water for three
     days.

          DODGE
     But how long is a day?

          TAYLOR
     Good question.
          (turning)
     Landon -- check your communications
     kit.

39     ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LANDON

He seems not to have heard.

          TAYLOR
          (sharply)
     Landon! Join the expedition.

          LANDON
          (rising)
     Sorry...
          (crossing to his kit)
     I was thinking of Stewart. What
     d'you suppose happened?

          TAYLOR
          (flatly)
     Air leak. Died in her sleep.

          LANDON
     You don't seem very cut up about
     it.

          TAYLOR
     It's a little late for a wake. She's
     been dead nearly a year.

          LANDON
     Then we've been away from Earth for
     eighteen months.

          TAYLOR
     By our time.
          (smiling at Landon)
     You've turned gray.

Landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor
adds lightly:

          TAYLOR
     Apart from that, you look pretty chipper
     for a man who's two thousand and thirty
     one years old.
          (casually)
     I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's
     hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for
     two thousand years, give or take a decade.
          (pause)
     Still can't accept it, huh?

          LANDON
          long pause)
     You know it.

          TAYLOR
     Because time has wiped out everyone and
     everything you cared for -- they're dust.

          LANDON
     Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still
     just a theory.

          TAYLOR
     It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep
     better.

Dodge enters scene. A handful of reddish sand dribbles through his
fingers.

          DODGE
     Nothing will grow here .... there's just a
     trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the
     nitrogen is locked into nitrates.

          TAYLOR
     Any sign of dangerous ionization?

          DODGE
     No.

          TAYLOR
          (rising)
     Okay. If there's no life here, we've got
     just seventy-two hours to find it. That's
     when the groceries run out.

He picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on. The others follow
suit.

          DODGE
     Which direction?

          TAYLOR
          (decisively, pointing
          west)
     That way.

          DODGE
     Any particular reason?

          TAYLOR
     None at all.

He moves out. Dodge follows. CAMERA PANS with them. They have gone
only a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.

40     REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANDON

Landon is squatting in the sand, sticking something into the soil.
It is a small American flag, the size of a handkerchief.

41     REVERSE  ANGLE - FEATURING TAYLOR AND DODGE

Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat. He explodes with wild laughter.
He is still laughing as they move out.

               DISSOLVE TO:

41-A     DAWN SHOT (GUNSIGHT     LOC #43)

42     THE ASTRONAUTS' TREK

They descend from the plateau (Ochre Dunes)

43     ASTRONAUTS CONTINUE MARCH,

Across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire (Black
Dunes).

44     THEY MOVE ACROSS THE TERRAIN

Jagged bolts of lightning flash across the sky, but bring, no rain, and
thunder claps sound like heavy artillery. (Gray Area)

45-     OUT
58

                    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

59     ANOTHER PART OF THE CANYON (OCHRE DUNES AREA) - GROUP
SHOT - DAY

Several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run.
wildly to escape the falling rocks. When the avalanche ends, they
sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with
     sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders. Taylor looks about him.

          TAYLOR
     Everybody all right?

Murmurs of assent from Dodge and Landon. Taylor rummages through a
     limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again,
     coming up with a cigar butt.

          TAYLOR
     Water check.

Dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it.

          DODGE
     Eight ounces.

Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky.

          DODGE
     It doesn't add up. There's a mantle of
     dust around this planet and yet it's
     as humid as a jungle. Thunder and
     lightning and yet no rain. Cloud cover
     every night and that strange luminosity,
     and yet no moon.

Landon also looks up at the sky.

          LANDON
     If only we could get a fix.

          TAYLOR
          (needling him)
     What would you learn? I've told you
     where you are and when you are.

          DODGE
          (gently)
     Taylor -- quit riding him.

          TAYLOR
          (harshly, to Landon)
     You're more than three hundred light
     years from your precious planet. Your
     loved ones have been dead and forgotten
     for twenty centuries. Even if you could
     get back, they'd think you were
     something that fell out of a tree.

          LANDON
          (wearily)
     All right --

          TAYLOR
     There's only one reality left. We're
     here and it's now. You get ahold of that
     and hang on tight, or you might as well
     be dead.

          LANDON
          (quietly)
     I'm prepared to die.

Taylor turns to Dodge, throws up his hands.

          TAYLOR
     He's prepared to die! Doesn't that make
     you misty? Chalk up another victory for
     the human spirit!

Dodge rises and moves off, o.s., either embarrassed by this colloquy
     or unwilling to hear it again. Taylor, cigar clamped between his
     teeth, spins toward Landon.

          TAYLOR
     Straighten me out on something. Why did
     you come along at all? You volunteered.
     Why?
          (a beat; no answer)
     I'll tell you. They nominated you for the
     Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not
     without losing your All-American standing

          LANDON
          (hard)
     Climb off me, will you!

          TAYLOR
     And the glory, don't forget that. There's
     a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere.
     It's probably turned green by now, and nobody
     can read the name plate. But never let it be
     said we forget our heroes.

          LANDON
     Taylor.     I'm telling you --

          TAYLOR
     Oh, and one last item. Immortality.
     You wanted to go on forever.
          (pause)
     Well, you damn near made it. Except for
     Dodge and me, you've lived longer than
     anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks
     like we're the last of the strain. You got
     what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?

Silence.     Taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing
his head on a rucksack.

          LANDON
          (softly)
     Okay. You read me well enough.
     Why can't I read you?

          TAYLOR
     Don't bother

          LANDON
          (looking off)
     Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But
          he makes sense. Held walk naked into a
     live volcano if he thought he could learn
     something no other man knew. I understand
     why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker.
     You're negative.

          TAYLOR
     But I'm not prepared to die.

          LANDON
          (heatedly)
     I'd like to know why not. You thought
     life on Earth was meaningless. You despised
     people. So what did you do? You ran away.

Taylor's eyes are closed. He is silent for a moment. When he speaks,
     his tone is soft, reflective.

          TAYLOR
     No, not quite, Landon. I'm a bit of a
     seeker myself. But my dreams are a lot
     emptier than yours.
          (pause)
     I can't get rid of the idea that somewhere
     in the Universe there must be a creature
     superior to man.

60     ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING DODGE

who has been wandering around, studying the boulders and the barren
soil. Taylor and Landon can be seen in b.g. Dodge spots something and
squats down to examine it.

61     CLOSEUP - WHAT DODGE SEES:

It is a tiny desert flower, no more than an inch high.

62     CLOSEUP - DODGE

His eyes light up as he calls:

          DODGE
     Taylor! Over here!

63     CLOSE. GROUP SHOT - ANGLING DOWN

as Taylor and Landon hurry over and kneel down on either side of Dodge.
The astronauts hover over the tiny flower like three magi perceiving
the infant Deliverer.

          DODGE
     Life.

He digs gently around the roots of the plant with a small instrument.

          DODGE
     Where there's one there's another. And
     another. And another.

          TAYLOR
     Let's find them all.

63-A     SUNSET SHOT

64     END OF THE TREK AS THE ASTRONAUTS START FROM THE CANYON

Absolute desolation (Ochre Area). The astronauts start down
the canyon.

A-R     SERIES OF SHOTS OF DESCENT OF ASTRONAUTS DOWN SHEER FACE OF A CANYON
     (Wire Grass Canyon).

For a brief moment several "creatures" appear. We cannot identify the
species.

                    QUICK DISSOLVE T0:

67     EXT. A DRY WASH - CLOSE GROUP SHOT - DAY

Blooming tamarisks border a. dry stream bed. Taylor and Landon hover
over Dodge, who is probing the soil with his drill. Their dungarees and
faces are caked with dust.

          DODGE
     It's a stream bed., no doubt about
     it -- but bone dry.

Landon strightens up and looks off, startled by something he sees.

          LANDON
     Look. . .

68     LONG SHOT - A CLIFF BEYOND THE TAMARISKS

with the astronauts in f.g. In the distance, on the skyline, we can
     make out a long row of wooden crosses. Some animal or vegetable matter
appears to be tied to the crosses.

          LANDON
     Scarecrows?

          TAYLOR
     Let's take a look.

Taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks, followed by Dodge and
Landon. Their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured. CAMERA HOLDS
on the distant crosses. For an instant only, three "creatures" again
appear on the skyline near the crosses. Then they vanish.

69     REVERSE ANGLE - THE ASTRONAUTS

as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket-nearer to the base of the-
cliff. They halt and look up at:

70     THE CROSSES - ANGLING UP - FROM ASTRONAUT'S P.O.V.

We can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to
the crosses and, thus mounted in a long row, seem to make a boundary
or serve as a warning. The living bipeds are no longer visible.

71     BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS

Dodge and Landon are still looking up at the strange crosses, but
Taylor is scanning the terrain at the base of the cliff. The sound of
rushing water can be heard.

          TAYLOR
          (half to himself)
     Never mind the scarecrows.

He breaks into a run, CAMERA PANNING with him as he moves toward a
declivity in the face of the cliff.

72     MOVING SHOT - DODGE AND LANDON

Agonized with thirst, they follow Taylor.

73     FLASH SHOT - THE TOP OF THE CLIFF

For an instant we see the bipeds again, moving in the same direction.

74     EXT. A DECLIVITY IN THE CLIFF - FEATURING TAYLOR

He scrambles up a rock-strewn gorge and looks off at the terrain
beyond.

75     EXT. A WATERFALL - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

The cascade is not spectacular, but the vegetation around it is
startlingly lush. (This location is not at Lake Powell, but at the
Ranch).

76     CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

His parched lips break into a smile.

                    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

77     EXT. WATERFALL AND POOL - FULL SHOT - DAY

The cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool. Thick foliage grows to
its very edge. Dodge is on his hands and knees, testing the liquid with
his kit. The others wait expectantly.

          DODGE
     It's loaded with minerals, but safe.

Without further ado Landon ducks his face into the pool. Dodge scoops
up water in his hands and drinks. Taylor     follows suit.

          LANDON
          (coming up for air)
     Can we take a dip?

          TAYLOR
          (looks around)
     Okay.

Landon and Dodge immediately remove their boots, strip down and plunge
into the pool. But Taylor does not yet disrobe. Alert and curious, he
strolls along the bank of the pool, looking around.

78     DODGE AND LANDON SWIMMNG

79     TAYLOR

as he briefly looks around, then starts taking off his shirt.

80     DODGE AND LANDON

as they arrive at opposite shore.

81     MED . SHOT - FAR SIDE OF POOL

as Landon sees something on shore.

82     TAYLOR IN WATER

as he swims across.

          LANDON'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Hey, Taylor! Look at this --

Dodge and Taylor climb out of the pool and squat beside Landon.

83     CLOSE SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:

The print of a large five-toad foot is clearly visible in the wet sand.

84     GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

Taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush, scanning the
ground for other sports.

                    CUT TO:

85     THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL - FULL PANNING SHOT

Our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b.g. is partially
obscured by broad-leafed foliage directly in front of CAMERA, which
PANS SLOWLY away from the waterfall and HOLDS on the astronauts'
clothing at the edge of the pool. Suddenly and inexplicably a pair of
dungarees slithers away into the underbrush. A few seconds pass. Now a
pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the SCREEN, blocking our
view.

86     REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSE ON A HUMAN FACE IN HEAVY FOLIAGE

Or is it human? The hair is matted, the face bearded, the jaw
prognathous, the orbital rim prominent.

87     ANOTHER ANGLE - AT EDGE OF POOL

A brown thick-fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and
plucks at a boot. The boot vanishes.

88     BACK TO THE ASTRONAUTS - ON OTHER SIDE OF POOL

Dodge is standing near Taylor and looking back at the spot where they
left their clothing. Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points
silently at the far bank of the pool.

89     WHAT THEY SEE:

Another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears.

90     REVERSE ANGLE - FULL PANNING SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

Led by Taylor, they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank.
Emerging from the water, they look around in bewilderment. Taylor makes
hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance. The
three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle (or rain
forest).

91-
93     EXT. - JUNGLE (OR RAIN FOREST) - SEVERAL SHOTS - MOVING WITH THE
ASTRONAUT'S

Little sunlight penetrates this dense vegetation. These SHOTS are
INTERCUT with:

94     WHAT THE ASTRONAUTS SEE:

fleeting forms as yet unidentified; trembling foliage; brown shadows
against a green backdrop.

95     EXT. A SMALL CLEARING - FAVORING THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

who stop at the edge of the clearing, startled by

96     WHAT THEY SEE:

a number of primitive bipeds, male and female, scarcely visible behind
trees and bushes on the other side of the clearing -- here a face,
there a portion of a head and torso. Throughout this sequence, the
primitives are never seen clearly or at close range.

97     BACK TO THE AST40IONAUTS

reacting. They speak in whispers.

          LANDON
     My God..they look almost human.

          DODGE
     They -- there's a herd of them.

          TAYLOR
     Show them we're friendly.

CAMERA PULLS BACK as Taylor advances a few steps into the clearing,
extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician.

          TAYLOR
          (warmly)
     Greetings!

98     REVERSE - THE STRANGE CREATURES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

There are perhaps a dozen of them. They shrink back as Taylor advances
-- hostile, frightened or both. We now see that some of them are
clutching articles of the astronauts' clothing and equipment. Taylor
stops, stares at them glumly.

          TAYLOR
     No cigar.

          LANDON
     Try telling them our names.

Taylor grimaces at Landon.

          TAYLOR
     Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker...
          (turning to the creatures)
     Listen, folks .....

More shrinking back by the frightened primitives.

          DODGE
          (softly)
     I'm afraid they aren't having any.

99-     OUT
102

103-     A SERIES OF FLASH SHOTS - THE JUNGLE (OR RAIN FOREST):
105

A pistol goes off with a deafening crash, and the primitive creatures
scatter in panicky flight. After a while, quiet returns to the jungle.

106     EXT. A JUNGLE PATH - THE ASTRONAUTS

They examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to
don whatever is able to be worn. Taylor puts on what remains of a
ripped pair of trousers; Dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of
the kit (it is a torn shelter half). Landon, like Taylor, has the
remains of his pants.

          DODGE
     They didn't leave much did they?

          LANDON
     Shall we follow them?

          TAYLOR
     Haven't much choice.

As they walk off down the jungle path.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

107     EXT. A GROVE OF FRUIT TREES - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

This need not be a cultivated grove. A few trees (peach or apricot or
avocado, it matters not) grow wild in a pleasant glade. Nor is the
grove extensive. The three astronauts sit under a tree in f.g.; the
primitives sit under a clump, of trees some fifty yards away. Each camp
is feeding and warily watching the other. In the distance beyond the
fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field.

108     THE PRIMITIVES - FROM LANDON'S P.O.V.

They too are sitting under trees, munching fruit. There are no more
than a dozen altogether.

109     BACK TO ASTRONAUTS - CLOSE GROUP SHOT

          TAYLOR
     Well, at least they haven't
     tried to bite us.

          DODGE
     Blessed are the vegetarians.

110     THE OTHER CAMP - FEATURING A YOUNG WOMAN

Squatting on her haunches, eating fruit, gazing back at Taylor. Her
hair is long and black, her skin nut brown, her face hauntingly lovely
and hauntingly stupid. This is NOVA.

111     BACK TO ASTRONAUTS

Landon looks o.s. at the primitives.

          LANDON
     We got off at the wrong stop.

          TAYLOR
     You're our optimist Look at the bright
     side. If that's the best there is
     around here, in six months we'll be
     running this planet.

          DODGE
          (suddenly)
     Look...

112     THE PRIMITIVES - THEIR P.O.V.

They appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts
have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm. The primitives get to
their feet, sniffing, listening

113     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE ASTRONAUTS

Puzzled and alarmed by the primitives' behavior, they too get to
their feet.

          LANDON
     Think they'll attack us?

Taylor turns, looks back at:

114     THE DISTANT JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

From which they recently emerged. There is no sign of life.

115     LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading  back toward
their jungle. A rumble becomes audible     it is the SOUND of HOOFBEATS.

116     VERY LONG SHOT - THE JUNGLE (OR FOREST)

Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a
canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge. The horses look
huge. So do the riders, but at this distance we cannot identify them.

117     LONG PANNING SHOT - THE PRIMITIVES

Cut off from their natural habitat, they reverse direction and flee
toward the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field).

118     LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

With an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop. The hunt is on.

119     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS

Stupefied, frozen in place.

120      LONG SHOT - THE RIDERS

Coming closer. We HEAR a rifle shot, then a flurry of shots.

121     MED. SHOT.

A bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads. They run,
CAMERA PANNING with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep
b.g.

122-     A SERIES OF FLASH SHOTS - THE HUNT IN THE SAVANNA
124
As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot.

125     MED. CLOSE SHOT - A RIDER

He reins in, raises his rifle and fires. For the first time, we se that
he is a GORILLA. He wears a simple quasi-military uniform -- tunic,
trousers and boots.

126     FLASH SHOT - DODGE

Running through the high grass. He is shot in the back and falls.

127     FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

He drops at the side of his fallen comrade.

128     CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANGLING DOWN ON DODGE

As Taylor rolls him over. Dodge is dead.

129     WIDER ANGLE SHOT - THE SAVANNA - FEATURING A LINE OF BEATERS

The beaters are all GORILLAS. They carry long sticks and nets, and
their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the
tall grass.

130-     A SERIES OF SHOTS - THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED:
135
(a)     Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another.
     He stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him.

(b)     A third mounted gorilla flings a net over a running female.
     She is hopelessly entangled. This is Nova.

(c)     Landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain, an ugly gash
     on his forehead.

(d)     Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees.
     A rider crosses his path without seeing him.

(e)     The beaters close in on Taylor, blocking his escape route.

(f)     Taylor changes direction and decides to run for it.

136     EXT, SAVANNA - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

Bent low, he flees through the tall grass. A SHOT rings out. Taylor
falls.

137     CLOSE ON TAYLOR

Lying on his back. His fingers go to his throat. Blood appears between
his fingers. He opens his mouth in pain, but no sound comes forth, as
Taylor sinks into unconsciousness.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

138     EXT. GROVE - FULL SHOT - THE HUNTERS - DAY

The hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees. Some of
the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback. In the
middle distance is a crude horse-drawn wagon. The sides and top of the
wagon form a wire cage. Three captive males and one female are visible
within the cage. Dodge and Landon are nowhere to be seen. Two gorilla
porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two
other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole.
Taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists
and ankles. CAMERA PANS with the two gorillas as they dump Taylor into
the wagon and close the tail gate.

139-     OUT
140

141     CLOSE ON TAYLOR - WITHIN WAGON CAGE

His throat is smeared with blood. His eyelids flutter as he regains
consciousness.

142     CLOSE SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

Three primitive males bound hand and foot. They seem docile in
     captivity. The female, Nova, clasps bound wrists around her bound
ankles and gazes blankly at Taylor. There is a JOLT of MOVEMENT as the
     wagon gets underway

143     CLOSE ON TAYLOR

With a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from
the cage.

144     TRUCKING WITH THE WAGON - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

A gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one foot planted he chest of
his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on   abdomen. Facing him is
another gorilla with an old-fashioned camera on a tripod.

          APE PHOTOGRAPHER
     Smile.

The hunter bares his teeth.

145      CLOSE ON TAYLOR

He faints.

                    FADE OUT

                    FADE IN

146     INT. A SURGERY - ANGLING DOWN ON TWO OPERATING TABLES NIGHT

The surgery is dimly-lit. (If possible we should be unaware of the
source of illumination.) Taylor lies strapped to the nearer table. He
appears to be unconscious. The young female captive, Nova, is strapped
to the table beside him. She is conscious. Taylor is receiving a direct
blood transfusion from her.

Hovering over Taylor are a NURSE and a surgeon named GALEN. Both are
chimpanzees. Galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white
smock. Galen is removing a filthy bandage from Taylor's neck. A door
behind them opens and DR. ZIRA, an animal psychologist,     enters. She,
too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's.

          ZIRA
     Which one was wearing the strange
     clothes?

          GALEN
     Him.

Zira looks down at Taylor.

          ZIRA
     Will he live?

          GALEN
          (irritably)
     I don't know. This beast lost a lot
     of blood.

Galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments. The equipment is
obsolescent and the room untidy -- like that of a callous small-town
veterinarian.

          GALEN
          (to Nurse )
     There's no probe here. Find one!

          NURSE
     Yes, sir.

She exits. Zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table.Her voice is
soft and well-modulated.

          ZIRA
     This place is dirty, doctor.

          GALEN
          (defensively)
     These animals are dirty, doctor. They
     stink, and they carry communicable
     diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up
     before they're brought here?

147     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

His eyes come open. Over this we hear:

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     You don't sound happy in your work.

          GALEN'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     I'm nothing more than a vet in this
     laboratory...

Taylor feebly turns his head and looks at Nova. She returns his gaze
with an unchanged empty stare. We sense that Taylor realizes her blood
is flowing into his veins. Over this we hear:

          GALEN'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius
     about me.

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     I did. But you know how he looks down
     his nose at chimpanzees.

Taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes. Weak as he is,we see his
astonishment at hearing them talk.

148     BACK TO GROUP AROUND OPERATING TABLE

as the Nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to Dr. Galen, who
protests to Zira:

          GALEN
     But the quota system's been abolished!
     You made it. Why can't I?

          ZIRA
     What do you mean, made it? I'm an
     animal psychologist, that's all. We
     don't have any authority.

          GALEN
     You do pretty well when it comes to
     getting space and equipment.

          ZIRA
     That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our
     work has value.

          GALEN
     Hmph.

          ZIRA
     The foundations of scientific brain
     surgery are being laid right here -
     in studies of cerebral function in
     these animals.

          GALEN
     They're still dirty. And their bite is
     septic. Look at that ...

He shows Zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand.

          GALEN
          (to Nurse)
     Hold his head.

The Nurse complies, gripping Taylor's skull with both hands. Galen
leans down and begins to probe the throat wound. Taylor passes out.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

149     INT. A ROW OF CAGES - ANIMAL LABORATORY - TRACKING SHOT DAY

The cages are no larger than small jail cells. There are four of them.
Bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible. Each
of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male. At the moment
the first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically. The
third occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored
hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the
floor of his cage. He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to
reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead. He has
correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower
under the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its
small base to support the broad-based fourth block.

149-A     CLOSE - TAYLOR

Taylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the
fourth cage. There is a clean bandage around his throat. He watches the
block-building primitive with contemptous amusement.

Both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive
tries to mount his tower. He stands there, staring dully at the
scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana.

149-B     MED. - THE     LABORATORY

A door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named JULIUS enters,
dressed in a keeper's uniform. He quickly closes the door, snatches up
a broom, starts sweeping. Julius is obviously late for work. Taylor
struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call
out.

          TAYLOR
          (soundlessly)
     Hey! Hey!

The three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages. Julius
barks at them.

          JULIUS
     Simmer down!
          (points at Taylor)
     You especially.

The third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks. Julius comes up
to Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its
floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead.

          JULIUS
     Better give it a try, stupid. Unless
     you like going hungry.

He returns to his sweeping. Taylor glowers at him. A moment later, the
door at the end of the aisle opens and Dr. Zira enters.

          JULIUS
     Good morning, Dr. Zira.

          ZIRA
     Good morning, Julius. How's our patient
     today?

          JULIUS
     No change. The minute you open the door,
     he goes into his act.

She starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage. He grasps the bars,
awaiting her anxiously. As she passes the second cage, the primitive in
it shakes the bars, jumps up and down. His tongue is hanging out. Zira
smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock.

          ZIRA
          (playfully)
     Well, what do we want this morning? Do
     we want something? Speak! Come on, speak!

The primitive continues to jump up and down energetically. Zira takes a
cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection.

          ZIRA
     Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

The man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars. She drops the cube in
his hands. He jams it into his mouth.

          JULIUS
          (concerned)
     You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.

          ZIRA
     Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

She moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her.

          JULIUS
     They're all tame until they take a
     chunk out of you.

150     CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR - ZIRA AND JULIUS

Taylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars.

          ZIRA
     Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat
     feeling better?

          TAYLOR
          (frantic mouthing)
     Listen, listen -- I can speak --

He winces, puts his hand to the bandage.

          ZIRA
          (sympathetically)
     Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?

          JULIUS
     See? He keeps pretending he can
     talk.

Taylor glares at Julius, slams the bars.

          TAYLOR
          (mouthing)
     I'm not pretending! I can talk!

Zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast Docket of her
smock, starts to scribble.

          ZIRA
          (excitedly)
     Did you see that? It's remarkable!

          JULIUS
     Huh?

          ZIRA
     He's trying to form words.

          JULIUS
     Well, you know what they say.
     Human see, human do.

Taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook.He
stops mouthing, points at them.

          JULIUS
     Now what?

Taylor gestures for Zira to come closer to the bars.

          ZIRA
     He seems to want something.

She advances tentatively toward the cage.

          JULIUS
     I'd be careful, doctor.

Taylor suddenly reaches through the bars, tries to snatch the pen and
notebook from Zira. Julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the
bars, hitting Taylor in the ribs.

          JULIUS
     What did I tell you!
          (to Taylor)
     Try that again, I'll break your arm!

Zira draws back, looking at Taylor in surprise.

151     CLOSER - TAYLOR

His face is twisted in frustration.

          TAYLOR
          (mouthing)
     What's the matter with you? I can
     talk! Can't you see that?

Over this a door is heard opening o.s., and Julius' voice, nervous,
deferential:

          JULIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Good morning, Your Excellency.

Taylor looks o.s.

152-     OUT
160

161     BOOM SHOT - THE THREE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

Julius and Zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just
entered the laboratory. Julius bows to him. This is DR. ZAIUS. Like the
other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are
of a Costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash
of his tunic.

          ZIRA
          (bubbling)
     Dr. Zaius, I'm so glad you could come.
     He's over here.

Zaius crosses with them to Taylor's cage. Beneath his austere manner,
we sense tension, worry. Zira looks up at Taylor, her tone an appeal.

          ZIRA
     Bright Eyes, show him! Go ahead!
     Do your trick!

Taylor just glares at her.

          ZIRA
     Speak! Go on.     Speak again.

          TAYLOR
          (silent mouthing)
     My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's
     Taylor!

          ZIRA
     There! Can you believe it? I looks
     like he's talking.

          ZAIUS
          (evenly)
     Yes, amusing. A man who acts like an ape.

Taylor turns to Zaius.

          TAYLOR
          (silent mouthing)
     I'm not acting! I can talk! How much
     proof do you want?

          ZIRA
          (thunderstruck)
     Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was
     answering you!

          ZAIUS
          (nodding, but unmoved)
     He shows a definite gift for mimicry.

Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly.

          ZIRA
     I wonder how held score on a Hopkins
     manual dexterity test?

Zaius' voice is quiet, but there is steel in it.

          ZAIUS
     An animal?

          JULIUS
     Look!

Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers.

          ZIRA
     He's moving his fingers!

          ZAIUS
     Of course. He saw you moving yours.

          ZIRA
     But perhaps he understood --

161-A     CLOSE - TAYLOR

He is pleading silently as Zaius' voice is heard over the SHOT.

          ZAIUS' VOICE
          (o.s., hard)
     Man has no understanding, Dr. Zira.
     He can be taught a few simple tricks.
     Nothing more.

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     I beg to disagree. According to my exper-
     iments --

161-B     CLOSE - ZAIUS

A warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor.

          ZAIUS
     A word to the wise, Dr. Zira. Experimental
     brain surgery on these creatures is one
     thing. I'm all for it.

161-C     CLOSER - TAYLOR

Fear clouds his eyes. Abruptly, he stops moving his lips.

161-D     MED. THE GROUP

Zaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor. He turns to Zira,
goes on in a more detached tone.

          ZAIUS
But your behavioral studies are another matter entirely. To suggest
that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is
nonsense. Besides, men are a nuisance. They outgrow their own food
supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our
crops.
          (looking casually
          at Taylor)
The sooner they're exterminated, the better.

He turns toward the door. A disappointed Zira follows him. Zaius looks
back at Taylor just before going out.

          ZAIUS
     It's a question of simian survival.

161-E     CLOSE - TAYLOR

He stares after Zaius, than looks away, slumps to the floor. A pause,
then a VOICE is heard.

          APE GUARD
     Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Yes, thank you.
          (pause, her voice
          much closer)
     Bright Eyes?

Taylor looks up.

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     I've got a present for you.

161-F     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CAGE

Standing outside the cage, held on a leash by an APE GUARD  is Nova.
She looks at Taylor without expression. Zira gestures at JULIUS.

          ZIRA
     Put her in with him.

Julius unlocks the cage door-, leads Nova inside, removes her leash and
collar. Taylor has gotten to his feet. Julius goes out, locking the
door behind him. Nova hesitates, then slowly reaches out, takes
Taylor's hand. Zira beams at them.

162-     OUT
169

                    DISSOLVE TO:

170     EXT.-  EXERCISE YARD - ANIMAL COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING SHOT DAY

It is nothing elaborate, A wire fence encloses a dirt yard. This
compound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is
visible in the distance.

There are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no
more than a third of them females. Some of them trudge around the dusty
yard like convicts in a penitentiary. Others squat against the sun-
drenched wall.

A big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it. Several
guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him. The
primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives'
circle.

171     CLOSER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING TAYLOR

He plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard,
occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound. Nova
is at his heels. He ignores her. Once again he looks off, stops
suddenly. Nova bumps into him. He turns, impatiently shoos her away,
then looks o.s., again.

172     ZIRA AND COMPANION - TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

Zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee, DR. CORNELIUS. He
wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers. Cornelius glances
surreptitiously around, covertly takes Zira's hand.

          CORNELIUS
     Do you have to work tonight?

          ZIRA
     No.

          CORNELIUS
     Neither do I.

He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

173     CLOSER - TAYLOR

He drifts toward the fence, Nova behind him.

174     MED. SHOT - ZIRA AND CORNELIUS

They come up to the fence. Zira nods toward Taylor.

          ZIRA
     That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling
     you about.

          CORNELIUS
     What's so special about him?

          ZIRA
     Watch.
          (to Taylor)
     Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our
     throat today?

Taylor stares at her impassively, then looks around to a that no guards
are watching, hunkers down, begins to scratch in the dust. Nova extends
unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat. Taylor flinches,
pushes her hand away. Nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her
own forearm, then searches for a similar bruise on Taylor's forearm.

          ZIRA
          (excited)
     Look -- she remembers.

          CORNELIUS
     Remembers what?

          ZIRA
     The blood transfusion.

          CORNELIUS
          (peeved)
     Zira, come on. You know they
     can't --
          (he stops, looking off)
     Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

Taylor looks up and o.s., quickly rises.

175     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YARD - FEATURING DR. ZAIUS

Who is approaching the two scientists from deep b.g. Zaius is followed
by a huge and much decorated gorilla Whom we recognize as the Leader of
the Hunt Club.

          ZIRA
          (in a whisper, to
          Cornelius)
     Something's bothering him. He's
     been prying around the lab for the last
     two days ...

          ZIRA
          (as Zaius comes
          nearer)
     Good morning, Dr. Zaius. You know Dr.
     Cornelius, my fiance.

Cornelius bows respectfully. Zaius is patronizingly polite.

          ZAIUS
     Oh, yes -- the young ape with
     a shovel. I hear you're planning
     another archeological expedition.

A-175     MED. SHOT - TAYLOR

He has stepped back from the marks he made in the-dust, is watching
Zaius with concern.

          CORNELIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Yes, sir. If the academy agrees.

          ZAIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     The project will require my support, of
     course.

176     MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING DOWN ON TAYLOR AND NOVA

A primitive male squats down to see what Taylor has marked on the
ground. In letters a foot high he has written:

     I CAN WRITE

Nova, at once petulant and playful, erases the WRITE with a bare foot.
Taylor angrily flings her aside. This violence provokes the primitive
male, who snarls at Taylor and cuffs him. Over this we HEAR from a
distance:

          CORNELIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     I hope I can count on it, sir.

          ZAIUS' VOICE
          (o.s)
     A friendly warning, Cornelius --
           when you're digging for artifacts,
     don't bury your reputation.

Taylor slugs the snarling male, who wades in, trying to bite him.

          A VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Guards!

177     WIDER ANGLE - THE FIGHT

Two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight. One of them lashes
out with his whip. The other pokes his torch at Taylor. Its flame
brushes his arm. Taylor opens his mouth, gives a silent yell of pain,
shrinks back. Zira runs to the fence.

          ZIRA
          (to guards)
     Stop! You've hurt him! Take them inside!

Prodding the malcreants with their torches, the two guards herd them
toward a doorway in the wall. Zira hurries around the side of the fence
and o.s.

178     MED. SHOT - ZAIUS, CORNELIUS, HUNT CLUB LEADER

          ZAIUS
     Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd
     like to discuss this expedition of yours
     in more detail.

          CORNELIUS
          (eagerly)
     Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come
     right over.

He exits hurriedly. The Hunt Club Leader turns to Zaius.

          HUNT CLUB LEADER
     I don't understand these animal psychologists.
     What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

          ZAIUS
     That man can be domesticated.

The hunter guffaws. Zaius turns away and looks down at:

179     THE DUST UNDERFOOT

Just beyond the fence we can make out the letters:

     I CAN

Zaius' extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence. The
foot wipes out the letters.

180     CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

His face is a mask.

181     INT. TAYLOR'S CAGE - MED. SHOT - DAY

He is slumped against the bars of the cell, gingerly touching a large,
reddening blotch on his arm. Julius watches him uncertainly from a few
yards away . In the b.g., the outside door opens and Zira rushes in,
hurries down the aisle.

          JULIUS
     What happened?

          ZIRA
     Those fools and their torches! Do you
     have any ointment?

          JULIUS
     I'll see.

He moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory, rummages
through some drawers.

182     MED. SHOT - ZIRA - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

Zira comes up to Taylor's cage, studies him solicitously.

          ZIRA
     I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

183     ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

He looks steadily at Zira, who is only an arm's length away. CAMERA
MOVES IN on them. Suddenly Taylor reaches out, snatching the pen and
notebook from the pocket of her smock. Zira leaps back with a cry.
Julius grabs a club, races up to the cage, unlocks the door.

          JULIUS
     I told you what you'd get!

184     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THEM ALL

Taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper. The guard
moves in, his club upraised.

          ZIRA
          (pleading)
     Julius, don't. It doesn't matter.

Julius swings his-club at Taylor's head. Taylor lifts his right arm to
ward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand. He
drops the pen and notebook. The guard swings again, driving Taylor to
the wall. Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles.

185     ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZIRA

The guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment:

          JULIUS
     Natural born thieves, aren't they?

Zira glances at the notebook. Her face clouds.

186     INSERT - WHAT SHE READS:

A hasty, almost illegible scrawl:

     MY NAME IS TAYLOR.

187     CLOSEUP - ZIRA

Her eyes afire with a wild surmise.

188     TWO SHOT - ZIRA AND JULIUS

Her eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard:

          ZIRA
     Get me a collar and leash. I'm
     taking him to the infirmary.

          JULIUS
     He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's
     against the rules.

          ZIRA
     Do as I say.

The guard shrugs and moves Off 0.3. Zira beckons to Taylor. He comes
forward to the bars of the cage.

          ZIRA
          (sotto voce)
     You wouldn't hurt me, would
     you... Taylor?

189     INT. DR. CORNELIUS' OFFICE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

The office is simple, almost Spartan. There are books but no bric-a-
brac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or
other modern office equipment. Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling
furiously on a sheet of paper. His leash has been removed, but not his
collar. Zira stands at his elbow. Cornelius paces nervously up and
down, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.

          CORNELIUS
          (stubbornly)
     It's a stunt. Humans don't write.

          ZIRA
     Dear, you're a scientist. Don't
     you believe your own eyes?

          CORNELIUS
          (to Taylor)
     Where did you learn to do this?

190     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE

Taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page,
hands it to Cornelius.

          CORNELIUS
     Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne,
     Indiana?

He looks at Taylor narrowly. Taylor nods.

          CORNELIUS
          (sardonically)
     Back on that planet you say you came from?
          (Taylor nods again)
     Um-hm.
          (to Zira)
     He may be intelligent, but he's also mad.

Taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at
Cornelius.

          ZIRA
          (reads aloud)
     'And you're a fool'.

She smiles. Cornelius bristles.

          CORNELIUS
     Now, just a minute --

          ZIRA
     Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.

Taylor has resumed writing. He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads
aloud.

          ZIRA
     'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What
     happened to Landon?'
          (looking at Taylor)
     I don't know.

          CORNELIUS
          (scornfully)
     And they fell out of the sky with you?

Taylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira.

          ZIRA
          (reading)
     'Not fell -- flew!'

Taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.

          CORNELIUS
     Flight is a scientific impossibility.

          ZIRA
     And even if it weren't, why fly?
     Where would it get you?

Taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here." He flings the
paper plane he has just fashioned into the air. It describes a graceful
arc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly
picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.

          CORNELIUS
          (softly)
     Well, now...

Taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.

          ZIRA
          (reading)
     'Do you have maps?'

Cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map
designed like a window shade. He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him
at the map.

191     CLOSE ON MAP

It's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion
known to the apes. Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect
of a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.

A swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea. In the southwest
quadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the
map like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace. Rubyidots in
the lade indicate ape communities. The northwest quadrant, colored
brown, is apparently uninhabited. East of the green belts is a patch of
green savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle. The eastern
quadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to
be lifeless desert and barren mountain. This area is marked FORBIDDEN
ZONE.

Using a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the
middle of the green belt.

          CORNELIUS
     We are here ...
          (moving pointer)
     You were captured about here.

Taylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern
desert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts'
landing and trek.

          ZIRA
          (interpreting his
          movements)
     You fell in the water here? ... you came
     ashore ... you marched across the desert ...
     the mountains ... many days and nights ...
     and reached the jungle.

Taylor nods, smiles gratefully.

          CORNELIUS
          (flatly)
     Out - of - the - question!.

Taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration.

          ZIRA
          (annoyed)
     Cornelius, why do you insist on
     provoking him?

          CORNELIUS
          (tapping map)
     No creature can survive in that part of
     the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've
     seen it.

192     WIDER ANGLE - THE THREESOME

Taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira.

          ZIRA
          (reading)
     'Then how do you account for me?,

          CORNELIUS
     I don't. And I'm not going to try.

          ZIRA
     But what about your theory? The existence
     of someone like Taylor might prove it.

          CORNELIUS
          (shushing her)
     Zira, are you trying to get my head cut
     off?

          ZIRA
     Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll
     have to accept it.

          CORNELIUS
     No, they won't -

Taylor touches Zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry.

          ZIRA
     Cornelius has developed a brilliant
     hypothesis -

          CORNELIUS
          (quickly)
     It's probably wrong --

          ZIRA
     -- that the ape evolved from a lower order
     of primate, possibly man. In his trip to
     the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a
     culture older than recorded time -

          CORNELIUS
     The evidence was very meager --

          ZIRA
     You didn't think so then.

          CORNELIUS
     That was before Dr. Zaius and half the
     Academy said the idea was heresy.

          ZIRA
     How can scientific truth be heresy? What
     if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?
     A mutation. A missing link between the
     unevolved primate and the ape -

Taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No!" scribbles
something on a piece of paper.

          CORNELIUS
     He's touchy, isn't he?

Taylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.

          ZIRA
     'I am not a missing link.'

          CORNELIUS
     Because if he is a missing link, it means
     the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their
     parchment.

          ZIRA
     Well, maybe they're not.

          CORNELIUS
     No, thank you'. I won't get into
     that battle.

          ZIRA
     Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!

          CORNELIUS
     Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine
     future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating
     careers. I'm up for a raise --

At that moment      there is a. loud RAP at the door o.s. All turn.

193     REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE DOOR

Dr. Zaius enters with another portly figure, DR. MAXIMUS. Like Zaius.,
Maximus is an orangutan.

          CORNELIUS
          (flustered)
     Dr. Zaius --

          ZAIUS
          (not unkindly)
     Did you forget our appointment,
     Cornelius?

          CORNELIUS
     Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling
     my notes.

          ZAIUS
     You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner
     for Animal Affairs?

          CORNELIUS
     Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see
     you again.

He hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers. Maximus notes Taylor
with distaste.

          MAXIMUS
     What is that?

          ZIRA
     A man, Dr. Maximus.

          MAXIMUS
     I know it's a man. And you know the
     rules. No animals outside the compound,
     and most certainly not without a leash.

194     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OFFICE - FAVORING ZAIUS

During the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office. He
glances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them.
Meanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus.

          ZIRA
     Yes, Sir. But this -- creature
     is a special case.

          MAXIMUS
     Why special?

          ZIRA
     We're -- conducting a new experiment.

          ZAIUS
     Wouldn't it more properly be done in
     your office?

          ZIRA
     Yes, Sir.

          MAXIMUS
          (calling)
     Guards?

The gorilla GUARDS enter from outside.

          MAXIMUS
     Return this beast to the compound.

195     ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

He regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him. One picks up
his leash. Over THE SHOT we hear:

          ZAIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     What's this?

196     REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING ZAIUS

Zira stiffens, looking at Zaius. He is holding the paper plane
fashioned by Taylor.

          ZIRA
     A toy. It floats on the air.
          (faint defiance)
     Try it.

          CORNELIUS
          (a warning)
     Zira....

Zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand, then back to Zira. He
smiles tolerantly.

          ZAIUS
     Nonsense.

He crumples the paper plane into a b all., drops it on the desk. The
ape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out. Zira
follows them.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

197      INT. CAGES - ANIMAL COMPOUND - FULL SHOT - DAY

The caged primitives are asleep. Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair
outside Taylor's cage. CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying
on his side, also asleep. Nova is curled up behind him. At the sound of
a door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching
Taylor's arm. He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to
hear:

          JULIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     What's up, Lieutenant?

198     REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

TWO GORILLA OFFICERS have just entered the compound. They wear side
arms. Julius has just risen from his  chair.

          APE LIEUTENANT
     We're taking Number Four over to surgery
     in five minutes. Have him ready.

          JULIUS
     How come? The beast's throat is nearly
     healed.

          LIEUTENANT
          (snickering)
     It's not his throat this time. The vet's
     going to geld him.

199     CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

He stiffens but does not move. The apes, of course, speak freely in
front of him, believing the animal cannot understand.

          JULIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Dr. Zira won't like it. She wants this
     pair to mate.

200     BACK TO THE APES - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

As the Lieutenant replies:

          LIEUTENANT
     These orders came from Dr. Zaius himself.
     There's nothing she can do about it.

The two gorillas exit. The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and
'Leash.

201     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

Pushing Nova aside, Taylor rises.

202     MED. SHOT - THE CAGE

As Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying
the collar and leash.

          JULIUS
          (murmuring)
     If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what
     they're going to do ...
          (raising collar)
     Stand still now...don't give me any
     trouble.

The heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly
snapping his neck. Julius falls unconscious. Taylor leans over him,
taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.

203     REVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NOVA AND MALE IN ADJACENT CAGE

The male has awakened. He stares stupidly at Taylor. Nova is
whimpering, little strange cries of fear. Taylor moves o.s.

204     ANOTHER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

He leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.

205     INT. A DARK CORRIDOR - FULL SHOT - DAY

Barefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.

206     CLOSE ON A DOOR

Which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door
     of a guard room. We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER. Taylor
fumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.

207     EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - TAYLOR - DAY

He emerges, quietly locking the door behind him. Two tethered horses
can be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard
from the nearby guard room. Taylor looks off.

208     LONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:

As already established, the animal compound is situated on the
outskirts of the apes' community. The strange skyline of the town can
be seen in the distance.

209     PANNING WITH TAYLOR

He starts to cross an open field outside the compound. At that moment
we HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room. Taylor breaks into
a run.

210     REVERSE ANGLE - THE COMPOUND

As the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward
their horses.

211     EXT. A DIRT ROAD - LONG SHOT - TAYLOR

He runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a
small lake, looking over his shoulder.

                    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

212     EXT. APETOWN - LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

The community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane.
There are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as
such, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall. The
architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and
less rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or
     exterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and
suggest an arboreal past.

A small number of apes are visible on the mall:

Taylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation.
He looks back at:

213     EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG SHOT - MORNING

The two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping
straight toward CAMERA. It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.

214     BACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT

He retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the
building.

215     INT. A DARK VESTIBULE - MOVING WITH TAYLOR

The vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which
Taylor moves toward a shaft of light. We HEAR faintly the discordant
chords of an organ. Or is it an organ? At any rate,a strange and
melancholy tune. Taylor arrives at a font.

216     INT. A TEMPLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

He appears out of darkness into half-light. The rear of the temple is
obscure. Taylor darts behind a screen. Crouching there, he observes:

217     A FUNERAL CEREMONY IN THE TEMPLE - MED. LONG SHOT

The temple itself is small and austere. There is no altar, but against
a plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a
book. Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black
robes. He stands in front of a closed coffin. A dozen mourners, seated
on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin. The
ape ladies wear cowls.

          MINISTER
     Weep if you must, but make an end of
     sorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has
     found peace in Heaven.

218     CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

Crouching, listening, wide-eyed.

          MINISTER'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     He was a model for us all, a gorilla to
     remember; hunter, warrior, defender of
     the Faith.

219     BACK TO FUNERAL CEREMONY - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

As the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself
(as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the
aisle toward the rear of the temple.

          MINISTER
     Cherished husband, beloved father,
     generous master -- yes, he was a font
     of simian kindness.

220      REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING AT TAYLOR

Who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g. The small fry is
coming closer. Over this we hear:

          MINISTER'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     The dear departed once said to me:
     'I never met an ape I didn't like'...

The small fry spots Taylor.

          CHILD
          (shrill soprano)
     Look!. It's a man!

The mourners' heads turn. Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.

221     ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING THE MINISTER

He is aghast.

          MINISTER
     In Heaven's name ...
          (aside to ushers)
     Get rid of that creature.

Two ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.

222     EXT. TEMPLE - CLOSE ON VESTIBULE DOOR

Staying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the
vestibule door. The two ape ushers appear.

          FIRST USHER
          (pointing)
     There he is:

They move toward Taylor.

223     FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

He runs out onto the mall.

224     FULL SHOT - THE MALL

Taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two
     mounted pursuers. Darting off in another direction, he races past
startled pedestrians.

225     REACTION SHOT - TWO CHIMP PEDESTRIANS

They do a slow take.

          FIRST CHIMP
     You see what I saw?

          SECOND CHIMP
     Must've escaped from the zoo.

226     MED. SHOT - A MOUNTED COP

He has spotted Taylor. Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he
swings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in
pursuit of the man.

227-     SEVERAL SHOTS - TAYLOR AND PURSUING MOUNTIE
231

Taylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners,
vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall. At
one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which
falls short. Taylor runs on.

232     EXT. AN AMPHITHEATER - LOW ANGLE SHOT (FROM GROUND LEVEL)

It is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the
central mail. Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes. The
dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level.

Taylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater. Changing
direction, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel. A moment
later the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward
the amphitheater, looking around for Taylor.

233     EXT. AMPHITHEATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT (FROM TOPMOST TIER)

Taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp
encircling the amphitheater. (A retaining wall shields him from the
view of the apes.) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor
crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:

THE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

The cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after
him.

235-     OUT
237

238     EXT. TOP OF AMPHITHEATER - PANNING WITH TAYLOR

He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his
original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp. Reversing
direction, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes
into an exit tunnel. The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop,
who joins him in the chase.

239-     ANOTHER PART OF THE MALL - A SWIFT SEQUENCE OF SHOTS
244

In which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape
shoppers and workers.

245-     EXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET - SEVERAL SHOTS
248

A market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors
behind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing
apparel, etc. As Taylor runs frantically through the market place,
several apes join the chase. In the ensuing pandemonium, like the
proverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.

249     EXT. A BUILDING - CLOSE ON AN ARCHWAY

Taylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his
pursuers. Then he darts through the archway into the building.

250     INT. BUILDING - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - DAY

For the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing. His pace slows to a
walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian
museum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive
artifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc. Over
this we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.

251     FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

He runs again.

252     MED. SHOT - AN APE MOTHER AND CHILD

Looking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past. The mother gives a
startled SCREAM.

253     REACTION SHOT - A MUSEUM GUARD

He starts after the fugitive.

254     ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM - FEATURING TAYLOR

He runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts
abruptly in close f.g., shocked by:

255     WHAT HE SEES:      DODGE

stuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.

256     CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

Reacting in horror. He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing
FOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:

          TAYLOR
     Dodge ...

Taylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.

                    CUT TO:

257     EXT. THE MALL - APETOWN - FULL SHOT FROM ON HIGH - DAY

Order has been restored in the open-air market. Taylor bursts suddenly
into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic
from ape guards in close pursuit. A mounted policeman spots him and
heads him off. Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another
mounted Gorilla. And then a third.

CAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall. We are witnessing
a hideous game: "baiting the man."  The mounted police do not shoot or
club Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long
whips CRACKING over his head.

258     CLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE

who unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor. This
time he bags his quarry. Taylor gives up. Spent, docile, entangled in
the net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall. Guards and
civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay. They regard
him warily.

259     CLOSE SHOT - DR. ZIRA

She pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his
side.

260     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

She paws at the net, crying impulsively:

          ZIRA
     Taylor, why'd you run away?

Zira removes the net from his face. Panting with exhaustion, Taylor
flicks a wild glance at her. He looks demented.

261     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TWO GORILLA OFFICERS

who approach Taylor and Zira. (They are the same gorillas introduced in
Scene 198.) One of them carries a collar and leash. The other presents
an I.D. card to Zira.

          LIEUTENANT
     Security police.

          ZIRA
          (promptly)
     I'm in charge of this man.

          LIEUTENANT
     No longer, madame. He is now in the
     custody of the Ministry of Science.

His colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle.

262     CLOSE SHOT - FEATURING TAYLOR

He speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible.

          TAYLOR
     Get away from me, you dirty ape!

263     FULL SHOT - THE SIMIANS AROUND TAYLOR

The arresting officer steps back involuntarily. All the apes freeze,
staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we:

                    FADE OUT

                    FADE IN

264     INT. CAGES - CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - DAY

The compound is dimly lit. Taylor, the bandage now gone from his
throat, is back in his old cage. The other cages, however, are empty --
their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo.
He is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled
on his lap. Idly he strokes her coarse hair. There is a dull glow of
madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like
a man talking to a dog.

          TAYLOR
     ...and that's when I decided to take
     up astronautical engineering., you see. I
     was halfway through college and I...
          (he breaks off)
     It's an old trick! The silent treatment.
     Four weeks and three days, and not a word
     from anyone. Not Zira.,or Cornelius...or
     that damn Julius. No one'll listen...
     only you. You...Nova. NO-VAH.

His manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank
comprehension. She brushes his moving lips with her fingers. He shrugs
wryly.

          TAYLOR
     Yeah...me Tarzan, you Jane. That's all
     right ... I had a puppy once that never
     barked. He just licked my hand.
          (pause)
     He's dead now. They're all dead. Everything...
     I think maybe they'll kill me, too. Are they
     afraid of me? I can't hurt them... but I
     threaten them somehow. Threaten their faith
     in simian superiority. Yeah ... you're right.
     They'll have to kill me.

Faint footsteps are heard o.s. Taylor and Nova look in the direction of
the sound. A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes
Taylor in the chest.

265     WIDER ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

An ape GUARD has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor. It forces him
back toward the rear of the cage. Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the
cage, steps inside. He unlimbers the whip., cracks it-'in Nova's
direction. She recoils. The jet of water hold Taylor at bay. Julius
grabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage. Taylor
tries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.

          TAYLOR
     Let her alone!

Julius swings the whip. It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into
the skin. Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee

          TAYLOR
     Where are you taking her? What are you
     going to do?

Julius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking
it behind him. Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings
himself against the bars.

          TAYLOR
          (raging)
     Take your hands off her, you black
     monster! You filth!

Julius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks
her inside.

          TAYLOR
     Why are you doing this? Say something,
     you hairy scum!

Julius gestures toward the ape guard

          JULIUS
     Turn it off!

The ape guard shuts off the hose.

          TAYLOR
     Answer me!

Julius strides over to Taylor's cage.

          JULIUS
          (fiercely)
     Shut up! The reason no one'll talk to
     you is because you're a freak!

          TAYLOR
     Where's Dr. Zira? Why--?

          JULIUS
     I said shut up!

He slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers.
Taylor yells in pain. Julius and the ape guard start out of the
compound.

          TAYLOR
          (wildly)
     Ape! Apes wearing clothes!
     It's a madhouse! A madhouse!

He sinks to the floor as the apes go out.

266     OUT

267     FULL SHOT - CAGE

Taylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage. She
eyes him sadly.

          TAYLOR
          (gently)
     Now I don't even have you.
          (pause)
     Imagine me -- needing someone. Back on
     Earth there was nobody. Women, yes.
     Lots of them. Love making  ithout love.
     That's the kind of world it was turning
     into, with the help of cynics like myself.
     So I left it -- because there was no one
     dear enough to keep me there.
          (pause)
     Did I tell you about Stewart?
          (Looking away)
     There was a lovely girl. The most precious
     cargo we brought along. If human life could
     survive here, she was to be the new Eve.
          (morosely)
     It's probably just as well she didn't live
     to see this.

He looks at Nova. She stretches her hands through the bars toward him.

          TAYLOR
     I wonder if it's Love between us.
          (looks around,
          smiles ironically)
     What a place to find it.

C-267     FULL SHOT - THE CAGE

Two gorilla officers enter, carrying torches. (These are the same apes
introduced in Scene 198.) One carries a double set of manacles. Julius
comes to meet them. The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from
the other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something. Julius
comes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage. He advances to
Taylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around
each of his ankles. Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his
wrists together, snaps on the cuffs.

D-267     WIDER ANGLE - THE CAGE

Taylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss. Julius leads him out of
the cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands
the other end to the Lieutenant. Nova and Julius watch in silence as
Taylor is led down the aisle and out the door.

268-     OUT
272

               DISSOLVE TO:

273     INT. INQUIRY ROOM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

Taylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise
deserted chamber. There is an empty chair on either side of him. Across
the room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs. There is a
small table directly below the dais. A third table stands at right
angles to the dais. Taylor looks around the empty room. A door is
opened by a gorilla BAILIFF, and Zira and Cornelius come into the room,
sit down on each side of Taylor. A moment later, DR.HONORIUS, the
Prosecutor and a CLERK enter, take their seats at the third table.

          TAYLOR
          (softly)
     Where have you been? Why didn't you come
     to see me?

          ZIRA
     Shhhh!

          TAYLOR
     What is this?

          ZIRA
     A hearing.

          CORNELIUS
          (hissing)
     Be clever. Be quiet,

          BAILIFF
     All rise!

Everyone gets up as THE PRESIDENT, Dr. Zaius and Dr. Maximus enter and
mount the dais. The President takes the center chair; the other two
flanking him.

          BAILIFF
     Be seated.

All sit down.

          PRESIDENT
          (pounds gavel once)
     This ad hoc Tribunal of the National
     Academy is now in session. President of
     the Academy presiding. On my right, Dr.
     Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs.
     On my left, Dr. Zaius, Minister of Science
     and Chief Defender of the Faith...
          (glancing at Prosecutor)
     Appearing for the State, Dr. Honorius,
     Deputy Minister of Justice.

Honorius rises and bows.

          PRESIDENT
          (raps gavel once)
     Let it be clear at the outset that all
     matters pertaining to this inquiry are
     confidential, and anyone discussing them
     outside this chamber will be held in
     contempt of the Tribunal.
          (a beat)
     You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.

          ZIRA
          (rising)
     By your leave, Mr. President -- the
     Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose
     of this inquiry.

The President appears to be taken aback. He glances at his colleagues.

          MAXIMUS
     You asked for the opportunity to present
     your case. Surely you must know why you're
     here.

          ZIRA
     My own purpose is to save this exceptional
     creature from mutilation.

          MAXIMUS
          (promptly)
     And our purpose is to settle custodial and
     jurisdictional questions concerning this
     beast, and determine what's to be done with
     him.

          ZIRA
     At the very least, this man has the right
     to know whether there's a charge against
     him.

          HONORIUS
          (rising)
     Objection. The accused is indeed a man.
     Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.

          PRESIDENT
     Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

274     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

Sensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles
confidently.

          ZIRA
     He is unlike any man you have ever seen -
     as we hope to prove.

          PRESIDENT'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Answer the question. Is he a man?

          CORNELIUS
          (tentatively)
     Sir? The question is the point at issue:
     Is he a man? Or a deviate? Or a freak of
     nature?

          HONORIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     Objection!

275     FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

As the Prosecutor continues:

          PRESIDENT
     Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira,
     you must admit the accused is a nonape,
     and therefore has no rights under ape law.

          ZIRA
          (rising)
     Then why is he called the accused Your
     Honors must think him guilty of something.

Honorius seems confounded. Zaius takes over.

          ZAIUS
     This man is not being tried. He is being
     disposed of.
          (pointing at
          Zira and Cornelius)
     It is scientific heresy that is actually
     on trial here.

          MAXIMUS
     Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn
     our friends that they endanger their
     own careers by defending this animal.

276     CLOSE SHOT - THE DEFENSE

Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat. Sensing their
predicament, Taylor rises impatiently.

          TAYLOR
     Then I'll defend myself.

277     FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

Although the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can
speak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice.
Flustered, the President bangs his gavel.

          PRESIDENT
     Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to
     sit down.

          TAYLOR
     My name is Taylor.

The President refuses to address Taylor directly. Checking a document,
he speaks to Zira.

          PRESIDENT
     It says here that his name is Bright
     Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.

          TAYLOR
          (voice rising)
     This hearing is absurd! Let me tell
     my story...

          PRESIDENT
          (pounds gavel)
     Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.

The Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his
chair.

          PRESIDENT
     State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

          HONORIUS
     Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is
     based on our first Article of Faith: that
     the Almighty created the ape in his own
     image; that He gave him a soul and a mind;
     that He set him apart from the beasts of
     the jungle, and made him the lord of the
     planet.

278     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

Taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. Zira and
Cornelius remain attentive to:

          HONORIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     These sacred truths are self-evident. The
     proper study of apes is apes. But certain
     young cynics have chosen to study man -
     yes, perverted scientists who advance on
     insidious theory called 'evolution.'

279     FULL SHOT - THE INQUIRY ROOM

As the Prosecutor continues:

          HONORIUS
     There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine
     the very cornerstone of our Faith

          PRESIDENT
     Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.

          HONORIUS
     Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man,
     the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.
     We know that he was wounded in the throat at
     the time of his capture. The State charges
     that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named
     Galen experimented on this wounded animal,
     tampering with his brain and throat tissues
     to create a speaking monster ...

          ZIRA
          (on her feet)
     ThatÕs a lie!

          PRESIDENT
          (pounding gavel)
     Mind your tongue, madame.

          ZIRA
     Did we create his mind too? Not only
     can this man speak. He can write. He can
     reason.

          HONORIUS
     He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission,
     let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

          PRESIDENT
     Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a
     farce.

Honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an
evil smile.

          HONORIUS
     Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is
     the second Article of Faith?

          TAYLOR
     I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

          HONORIUS
     Of course he doesn't know our culture -
     because he cannot think.
          (to Taylor)
     Tell us why all apes are created equal.

          TAYLOR
     Some apes, it seems, are more equal than
     others.

          HONORIUS
     Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction
     in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men
     have no souls? What is the proof that a
     divine spark exists in the simian brain?

          TAYLOR
          (hands paper to Zira)
     Show this to the President.

Zira moves toward the dais. Honorius returns to his own table.

          ZIRA
     Since the defendant is forbidden to speak
     in his own defense, he asks that this
     statement be read into the record.

          PRESIDENT
     Read it yourself.

          ZIRA
          (reading aloud)
     'I have come to you from a planet in a
     different solar system. I am an explorer
     in space, with no hostile intentions against
     your civilization. On my planet it was the
     primate Man who evolved Into a thinking
     animal, while the apes remained..."

          PRESIDENT
          (rapping gavel)
     Stop right there. Bring me that paper.

Zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the President. He
glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to Zaius.

          PRESIDENT
          (to Zira)
     This is a joke in very poor taste.

          ZIRA
     Is it a joke to seek the truth about
     this man?

          ZAIUS
          (glancing at document)
     Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship
     from outer space sank in an inland sea
     of our eastern desert.

          ZIRA
     I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.

          ZAIUS
     Do you believe him?

          ZIRA
          (uneasily)
     Like you, I find it difficult.

          ZAIUS
     But how convenient that the proof of
     his arrival has vanished?
          (glancing again
          at document)
     You also state that Bright Eyes had two
     intelligent companions at the time of
     his capture.

          ZIRA
     This is his assertion.

          ZAIUS
     Where are they now?

          TAYLOR
          (blurting it out)
     One is in a museum!

          PRESIDENT
          (pounding gavel)
     Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

Returning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent.

          ZAIUS
     How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead
     men, like sunken ships, can tell no
     stories. And his other companion?

          ZIRA
     He doesn't know.

          ZAIUS
     Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor
     has reassembled all he surviving humans
     captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.

          HONORIUS
     That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses --
     correction -- my exhibits are on display in
     the amphitheater.

          PRESIDENT
     Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.

The President rises, starts out, followed by the others. Taylor is
last, being led on a leash by the bailiff.

280      OUT

281     EXT. AMPHITHEATER - FULL SHOT - DAY

The inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater. Two APES
stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in
the center of the pit below the dais. There are three primitive males,
the female Nova -- and Landon. He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is
cropped close.

282     CLOSE - TAYLOR

He turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication.

          TAYLOR
          (a whisper)
     It's him...Landon.

          ZIRA
     Which one?

          TAYLOR
     Second from the left.

283     FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

Zaius glances at the accused.

          ZAIUS
     Well...do you acknowledge kinship with
     any of these creatures?

          TAYLOR
     With one of them.

          ZAIUS
     Identify him, then. Speak to him.

Taylor moves forward for a few paces, stops.

          TAYLOR
     Landon?

284     CLOSER SHOT - FEATURING LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

Landon looks catatonic. His face is in shadow

285     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR

Stunned by Landon's imbecility.

          TAYLOR
     John ... it's me, Taylor.

Taylor steps forward to grasp his arm. There is still no response.
Taylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face. There is
a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.

286     FULL SHOT - THE AMPHITHEATER

As Taylor whirls on Zira.

          TAYLOR
     You! ... You knew about this?

          ZIRA
     No, I swear -- I never saw this
     man before.

          TAYLOR
          (whirling on Zaius)
     You did this to him! You've removed his
     frontal lobes!

          PRESIDENT
     Silence!
          (turning)
     Bailiff, take the prisoner inside!

The bailiff Jerks brutally on Taylor's leash, pulling him toward the
door leading under the amphitheater.

A-286     INT. INQUIRY ROOM - MED. SHOT - DAY

The bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his
chair. Moments later the other apes enter the room. All take their
seats but Zaius. Taylor glares at him furiously.

          ZAIUS
          (calmly)
     Mr. President, a word of explanation: the
     creature in question suffered a skull
     fracture during the hunt. Two fine
     veternary surgeons under my direction
     were able to save his life. But the beast
     could not speak, of course. Nor will he
     ever speak

Taylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.

          TAYLOR
     You destroyed his memory! His mind! His
     identity! And, you want to do the same to
     me!

          PRESIDENT
          (pounding gavel)
     Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that
     monstrosity!

The bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:

          TAYLOR
     You barbarians!

The powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff
lashes his wrists together. Then the bailiff gags Taylor. His voice is
cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.
The guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.

Meanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet. His tone is firm, but
conciliatory.

          CORNELIUS
     May it please the Tribunal: I for one
     grant that this being cannot have come
     from another planet. But this much is
     certain -- he comes from somewhere in the
     Forbidden Zone. He has described the region
     to us, and described it accurately, for I
     have been there.

          PRESIDENT
     You visited the Forbidden Zone?

          CORNELIUS
     Why, yes, sir. A year ago. With the special
     permission of the Academy.

          ZAIUS
          (to President)
     He exceeded his orders. His travel permit
     was promptly revoked.

          CORNELIUS
     Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But
     not before I discovered evidence of a simian
     culture that existed long before the Sacred
     Scrolls were written ...

          HONORIUS
     Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.

          PRESIDENT
     Sustained.
          (to Cornelius)
     Your archeological theories have no bearing
     on the disposition of this creature.

          ZAIUS
          (softly)
     Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.

          ZIRA
          (rising)
     Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his
     identity.

          PRESIDENT
     How so?

          ZIRA
     Let us assume, as common sense dictates,
     that the prisoner's story is false. But if
     he does not come from another planet, then
     surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.
          (a beat)
     As an animal psychologist, I have found no
     physiological defect to explain why humans
     are mute.

          HONORIUS
     Objection!

          PRESIDENT
     Sustained.

          ZIRA
          (plunging on)
     Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw
     lies not in anatomy but in the brain.

          HONORIUS
     Objection!

          PRESIDENT
     Sustained.

          ZIRA
          (voice rising)
     Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

Cornelius has regained his courage. Rising to Zira's support, he points
at Taylor.

          CORNELIUS
     Yes! Behold this marvel, this living paradox,
     this missing link in an evolutionary chain!

          PRESIDENT
          (pounding gavel)
     Silence!
          (Puffing with rage)
     You have gone too far.

          ZAIUS
          (calmly)
     There you are, Mr. President. I warned you
     these two would use this hearing as a forum
     for subversion.

          MAXIMUS
     You were right! The advocates of heresy have
     revealed themselves.

          ZAIUS
     Mr. President, I think an indictment is
     in order.

          HONORIUS
          (promptly)
     Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira
     and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal,
     malicious mischief and scientific heresy.

          PRESIDENT
     Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine
     all the evidence presented here and in due
     time render a verdict on the proposed
     indictment and on the disposition of the
     deviate in question.
          (pounds gavel once)
     This hearing is adjourned.

All rise. The guard drags Taylor from the inquiry room. Zira and
Cornelius stand there, stunned by the entrapment into which Zaius has
maneuvered them.

287-
289      OUT

                    DISSOLVE TO:

290     INT. A SMALL OFFICE - CLOSE ON DR. ZAIUS - NIGHT

The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in
fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used. There are
many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading
one of them and taking notes. He looks up as someone KNOCKS at the
door.

291     REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST ZAIUS

The two agents push Taylor through the doorway.

          ZAIUS
     Wait outside.

The officers withdraw, closing the door. Collared, wrists manacled,
Taylor stands facing the desk.

          ZAIUS
     The verdict is in. At the moment your
     simian friends -- and  sponsors -- are
     free on bail. But they'll soon be brought
     to trial for heresy.

292     ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import. We note at
once a change In Zaius' tone and attitude. He no longer treats Taylor
like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who
must be intimidated by the threat of terror.

          TAYLOR
     What about me?

          ZAIUS
          (offhandedly)
     Oh, your case was preordained. In a way,
     you performed a service for the State ...
          (smiling)
     Because your hearing made it possible
     for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
          (a beat)
     And now the Tribunal has placed you in
     my custody for...final disposition. Do
     you know what that means?

          TAYLOR
     No.

          ZAIUS
     Emasculation, to begin with. Then
     experimental surgery. On the speech
     centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a
     kind of living death.

Taylor stiffens but says nothing. Zaius lets this prospect sink in,
then continues.

          ZAIUS
     However, it's within my power to grant
     You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned
     you here tonight.
          (a beat)
     Tell me who and what you really are and
     where you come from, and no veterinary
     will touch you.

          TAYLOR
     I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.

          ZAIUS
     You lied. Where is your tribe?

          TAYLOR
     My tribe, as you call it, lives on another
     planet in a distant solar system.

          ZAIUS
     Then how is it we speak the same language?
          (suddenly intense)
     Even in your lies, some truth slips
     through! That mythical community you're
     supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?

          TAYLOR
     What about it?

          ZAIUS
     A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name
     that was belligerent.
          (more calmly)
     Where were you nurtured?

          TAYLOR
     I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's
     charge -- that I'm a monster created by
     Dr. Zira.

          ZAIUS
     Certainly not.     You're a mutant.

          TAYLOR
     That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius
     claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.

          ZAIUS
          (smiling)
     Of course.

          TAYLOR
          (growing bolder)
     All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why
     does the appearance of one mutant send
     you into a panic?

          ZAIUS
     Because you're not unique. There was the
     one you call Landon --

          TAYLOR
     Then you admit --

          ZAIUS
     I admit that where there's one mutant there's
     probably another. And another. A nest of them.
     Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?

          TAYLOR
          (pause)
     Thank you for calling me Taylor.
          (more firmly)
     Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How
     did this upside down civilization ever get
     started?

          ZAIUS
          (strangely calm)
     You may well call it upside down, since you
     occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.
          (pause)
     The eastern desert has never been explored --
     because we've always assumed that no life can
     exist there.
          (a beat)
     Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there
     another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?

          TAYLOR
     I don't know.

          ZAIUS
     If you are protecting others of your kind,
     it will cost you your identity.

          TAYLOR
     I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing
     was a farce. What have I done?

          ZAIUS
     You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I
     do know who you are, Taylor. As I know
     that others of your kind must live in the
     Forbidden Zone.
          (decisively)
     You have just six hours to make a full
     confession. After that I'll employ surgery
     to obtain one.
          (calling off)
     Guards!

The two burly security agents open the door and enter.

          ZAIUS
     Take this creature back to his cage.

The guards seize Taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway. He
twists around, faces Zaius.

          TAYLOR
     All right, you can cut me to pieces. It's
     within your power.
          (with force)
     But know this, doctor. You do it because
     you're afraid of me. You do it from fear!

Zaius jerks his head silently toward the door. The apes drag Taylor
through it.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

293     INT. ADJACENT CAGES - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

A few hours have passed. Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across
the aisle. He sits on the pile of straw. There is an ugly welt on his
cheek made by the security officer's whip. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Taylor
and Nova look up and off.

294     REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

A solemn, teen-age chimp named LUCIUS appears outside the cage. The
guard Julius rises from his chair.

          LUCIUS
     Are you Julius?

          JULIUS
     What do you want?

          LUCIUS
     I'm from the Office of Animal Affairs.
          (indicating Taylor)
     This male's to be transferred to the zoo.

          JULIUS
     At this hour? Who says so?

Taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as Lucius continues
gravely, with just a note of disdain.

          LUCIUS
     Don't they tell you anything? The Anti-
     vivisectionist Society is up in arms. They're
     going to save this beast from those butchers
     in the lab. If he can speak he belongs in the
     public zoo.
          (taking off)
     But what'll probably happen is that some
     money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus.
     And then we'll have to pay to see what
     rightfully should have --

          JULIUS
     Stop making speeches and show me the order.

Lucius hands the guard a document. It is dark here, so Julius crosses
to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. Lucius,
behind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or
strike the guard. Taylor is slow to understand. Lucius shakes his
head impatiently.

          JULIUS
          (peering at document)
     This order's no good. It must be counter-
     signed by Dr. Zaius --

Lucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove. The guard's head crashes
against the bars and he is stunned.

          LUCIUS
     Hit him!

Taylor complies  bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the
guard's neck. Julius collapses. The youngster immediately squats down,
gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot. CAMERA MOVES IN.

          TAYLOR
     Who are you?

          LUCIUS
          (looking up,coolly)
     So you can talk.
          (as he works)
     I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was
     her idea. You're not really going to the
     zoo. That's just our cover story in case
     we're stopped.
          (off again)
     Although I do feel that if it ever came
     down to a question of whether something
     like you should be public or private
     property --

          TAYLOR
     Come on. Get me out of here.

Taking the guard's keys, Lucius rises and unlocks the cage. Nova enters
the scene, coming to the bars of her cage.

295     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA

He gazes at her, tense with indecision. She flashes an imploring smile,
a mute appeal that cannot be denied. Over this we hear:

          LUCIUS' VOICE
          (o.s.)
     We've got to move fast.

296     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE LUCIUS

as Taylor leaves his cage.

          TAYLOR
     She comes along too.

          LUCIUS
     Zira doesn't want your female.

          TAYLOR
     I want her.

          LUCIUS
          (a shrug)
     If you insist. But I'm not taking
     any orders --

          TAYLOR
     Fine. Just let her out.

Lucius unlocks Nova's cage. She comes out quickly, takes Taylor's hand.
They follow Lucius out of the compound.

297     EXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

A horse-drawn caged wagon (like that used in the hunt) stands near the
building. Zira waits at the rear of the wagon. Lucius, Taylor and Nova
emerge from a doorway or archway and join her. Zira notes Nova's
     presence with disapproval. They speak in undertones.

          ZIRA
          (to Lucius)
     I told you not to bring the other one.

          LUCIUS
     He wouldn't leave her.

          ZIRA
          (with a sigh)
     All right...
          (to the humans)
     Get in...hurry.  Put this on.

          TAYLOR
     Listen-

          ZIRA
     Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get
     away with this. Remember that men all
     look alike to most apes.

Taylor and Nova comply, climbing into the cage. Lucius closes the
tailgate. Lucius and Zira move to the front of the wagon and climb
aboard. Lucius takes the reins. As they move off:

                    WIPE TO:

298     EXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - NIGHT

As previously established, the animal compound is on the outskirts of
Apetown. The abductors must cross the causeway on their route of
escape. In the distance, near the gazebo, we can see the lights of
several torches.

The caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway. At the same
time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side
of the causeway, coming toward CAMERA. Lucius stops the wagon.

299     CLOSE TWO SHOT - LUCIUS AND ZIRA - ON THE WAGON

          LUCIUS
          (apprehensively)
     Gorilla hunters ...

          ZIRA
     Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

300     BOOM SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY

As the mounted hunter nears the wagon, we can see two bodies slung
across the backs of the pack animals.

301     FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

They look out at:

302     THE PASSING HORSES - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

The bodies on the horses are naked human corpses.

303     MED. LONG SHOT - THE CAUSEWAY - REVERSE ANGLE

In immediate f.g., near the gazebo, is a similar wagon. It has lost a
wheel, and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway. Two naked
primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage. Four or five armed
gorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the
others are passing a jug from hand to hand-.

The leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as
the lab wagon approaches.

          LEADER
     Hold it!

Lucius obeys. The hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their
leader calls authoritatively:

          LEADER
     Ah, Doctor Zira! Our wagon broke down! I'm
     afraid we'll have to commandeer yours.

304     CLOSER ANGLE - THE LAB WAGON

as the Hunt Club Leader rides over, recognizing the animal
psychologist.

          ZIRA
     You can't! I've two sick humans in the
     cage. We're taking them to the chief vet
     at the zoo ...

          LEADER
          (indicating his
          own wagon)
     We bagged two live ones today. I'll have
     to ask you to take them along.

He moves to the rear of the wagon.

          ZIRA
          (following him;
          frantically)
     No, no, my animals are diseased... Leave
     them alone! They're diseased, I tell you!

Lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon.

305     REVERSE ANGLE - REAR OF WAGON

The hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on
the humans. They sound ready for sport.

          FIRST HUNTER
     Give him a taste of fire!

One of the hunters points his torch at Taylor, who, quite naturally,
shrinks back as Lucius runs into scene.

          LUCIUS
     Stand back! He's dangerous!

          FIRST HUNTER
     Why?

          ZIRA
     He's rabid! His bite is fatal!

          FIRST HUNTER
     You serious?

          LUCIUS
     You would die in agony!
          (with appropriate gestures)
     Frothing at the mouth!

The hunters fall back. Lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and
Zira run back to the front of the wagon. Lucius snaps the reins and the
wagon moves off. The hunters follow it a few paces, pausing near their
mounted leader.

          FIRST HUNTER
     They treat those animals better than they
     treat us.

          LEADER
     I still say the only good human is a dead
     human.

The fugitives' wagon recedes beyond the gazebo, as we:

                    DISSOLVE TO:

306     EXT. AN OPEN RANGE - LONG SHOT - DAWN

The horse-drawn wagon is silhouetted-against the dawn light, bumping
across a semi-arid plain studded with mesquite and sage. (This SCENE
can be SHOT either on the Navajo reservation near Page or on the
Ranch).

                    DISSOLVE TO:

307     EXT. SAVANNA (OR CULTIVATED FIELDS) - LONG SHOT - MORNING

This is the same area described on page 24, where the hunt occurred. As
the wagon rolls along a dirt track, the tall grasses of the savanna (or
cultivated field) can be seen in b.g.

308     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN WAGON CAGE

Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous. She peers out at
the field, apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain. She
nudges Taylor, waking him.

309     EXT. GROVE OF WILD FRUIT TREES - LONG PANNING SHOT - DAY

This, too, is the location described on page 24. CAMERA PANS with the
wagon as it rolls into the grove and HOLDS on three horses. Cornelius
sits astride one horse; the other two nags are heavily burdened with
packs and saddlebags.

310     CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROVE - FAVORING CORNELIUS

He dismounts as Zira and Lucius jump down from the wagon
and hurry toward him. Cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss
lightly, ape-fashion.

          CORNELIUS
     How did it go?

          ZIRA
     There was one bad moment -- some hunters
     stopped us.

          LUCIUS
          (calmly)
     I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies.

311     CLOSE TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - IN CAGED WAGON

The apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot. Exasperated to be
thus ignored and caged, Taylor kicks the tailgate, shouting:

          TAYLOR
     Let me out of here!

312     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE THE GROUP

Lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate. Taylor gets out of the
wagon, stretching his stiffened joints. Nova follows suit. During the
ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated, pacing to and fro,
her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or
something.

          CORNELIUS
          (approaching)
     Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.

          TAYLOR
     Do you have any weapons?

          CORNELIUS
     The best. But we won't need them.

          TAYLOR
     Just the same, I want one.

He moves toward one of the horses. Cornelius starts after him.

          CORNELIUS
     Look here, Taylor. I'm in charge of this
     expedition --

Taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs, examines it.

          TAYLOR
     Fair enough. But you're no longer in
     charge of me. And I don't mean to be
     captured again.

Zira and Lucius have come up.

          CORNELIUS
          (peeved)
     As you wish.

          TAYLOR
     Zaius seems to think there might be
     another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone.
     That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

          ZIRA
     Cornelius and I have been indicted for
     heresy. Unless we can prove our theories,
     we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

          TAYLOR
     You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?

          CORNELIUS
     To the diggings I worked at a year ago.
     It's a three day ride across the eastern
     desert, near where you claim you landed
     from that planet of yours.

          TAYLOR
     You still don't believe me, do you?

          CORNELIUS
          (shrugs)
     It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What
     would we find?

Taylor makes a helpless gesture, realizing that he cannot present sure
proof.

          TAYLOR
     Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft.
     Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my
     countrymen.

          CORNELIUS
     Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake
     is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no
     vegetation. Nothing.

          TAYLOR
     I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you
     for saving us. You'll be in trouble for
     going there.

          ZIRA
          (a smile)
     We've been in trouble since the moment we
     met you.

Nova seizes Taylor's arm to get his attention. Trying to communicate,
     she makes whimpering sounds and points at:

313-
314     OMIT

315     THE DISTANT JUNGLE - AS SEEN FROM THE GROVE

This is the same view of the jungle that Taylor saw when the gorilla
     hunters emerged from the trees. (Page 25)

          ZIRA'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     What's she pointing at?

316     BACK TO TAYLOR AND THE OTHERS

Taylor smiles at Nova, gives her a reassuring shrug.

          TAYLOR
     That's the way home. And she knows it.

Nova turns away, still holding Taylor's arm, tries to lead him toward
the jungle.

          TAYLOR
          (sharply)
     Nova!
          (she turns; he shakes
          his head, says gently)
     We can't stay there. It's not safe.

She looks at him sadly.

          ZIRA
     We'd better get started. If the mounted
     police pick up our trail, they'll come
     this far at least.

          CORNELIUS
     Right.
     (to Lucius)
     Let's put the water and provisions in
     the wagon.

He and Lucius move off toward the horses.

          ZIRA
          (indicating Nova)
     Are you going to take her with you?

          TAYLOR
     Yes.

          ZIRA
     Actually, you're a different breed.
     This creature will never evolve.

          TAYLOR
     Maybe not.

          ZIRA
          (smiling)
     You want her that much?

          TAYLOR
          (testily)
     You threw us together, remember? And you
     guessed right. Men, like apes, get
     despondent without a mate.

He walks off to help Lucius and Cornelius. Nova tags along behind him
as we:

A-316     THE GROUP MOVES ACROSS A PLATEAU

                    DISSOLVE TO:

317     EXT. DRY WASH AND TAMARISKS - FEATURING SCARECROWS - DAY

The caravan is crossing, in a reverse direction, the route taken by the
astronauts on page 17. The three apes are on horseback. Taylor and Nova
follow in the wagon. They are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on
the bluff above the dry wash.

318     MED. SHOT - THE THREE MOUNTED APES

They halt briefly and look up at the crosses. Lucius is impressed.

          LUCIUS
     Who put them up?

          ZIRA
     The Hunt Club.

          LUCIUS
     To scare off humans?

          CORNELIUS
     To scare us, too. We're entering
     the Forbidden Zone.

They move off again, riding across the dry wash.

319     TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - SEATED ON THE WAGON

They, too, have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows. Nova is
plainly terrified. She grabs Taylor's arm, whimpers.

          TAYLOR
     Don't worry. You'll be safe with me.
          (sudden smile)
     Here. It's time you learned to earn
     your keep.

He hands the reins to Nova. She just sits there. He demonstrates.

          TAYLOR
     You can do it. Like this ...

Nova flicks the reins, reacting in wide-eyed, open-mouthed disbelief as
the horse obeys her.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

320     EXT. DESERT PLATEAU - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY FOR NIGHT

The party is traversing a red desert to the east of Dead Lake. Great
sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor. From this vantage point
the horses look no bigger than ants.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

321     EXT. RIM OF A DEEP GORGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

This is terrain never before seen in this picture. (Lake Powell
location, a few miles northeast of Wahweap). The party can be seen on
the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast,
irregular river of deep blue water. Taylor, Cornelius and Lucius are
unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the
backs of horses. Zira watches them.

A-321     CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

Zira wanders off, falls to her knees.

          LUCIUS
     Something's wrong with your mate.

Taylor looks off. He and the others move quickly to Nova, CAMERA
PANNING with them.

B-321     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - AROUND NOVA

She has been retching. Taylor lifts her up. She is faint with nausea.
Zira squats down beside them.

          ZIRA
     Let me handle this.
          (ruefully, to Taylor)
     You may be smarter than I am, but I'm
     the veterinary on this planet.

Assisting Nova to her feet, Zira leads her off toward the wagon.

C-321     MED. SHOT - CORNELIUS, TAYLOR AND LUCIUS.

Taylor watches the departing females, then looks down at the river.

          TAYLOR
     Where does the river lead?

          CORNELIUS
     It empties into a sea some miles from
     here. That's where the cave is.

D-321     LONG SHOT - THE RIVER - FROM THEIR P.O.V..

The river winds o.s. between the sheer sandstone Cliffs rising from
either bank.

          TAYLOR'S VOICE
          (o.s.)
     And beyond that?

E-321     THREE SHOT - TAYLOR, LUCIUS AND CORNELIUS

          CORNELIUS
     Don't know. At high tide you can't ride
     along the shore, and we had no boats on
     the last expedition.

          TAYLOR
     You've never told me why this region's
     called the Forbidden Zone.

          CORNELIUS
     No one really knows. It's an ancient
     taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls.
     The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.

          LUCIUS
     Shouldn't we be moving on?

          TAYLOR
     I'm for that.

They start toward the horses and wagon.

F-321     GROUP SHOT - NEAR WAGON

Zira is looking curiously at Nova, who stands in the shade leaning
against the wagon as the males enter the scene. Nova's nausea has
passed, and she comes smiling to Taylor.

          TAYLOR
     What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch
     of the sun?

          ZIRA
     She's not sick at all.
          (a beat)
     She's pregnant.

G-321     CLOSEUP - TAYLOR

Consternation slowly gives way to wonder. He grins.

          TAYLOR
     So I'm not an altogether
     different breed, you see?

325     THE DESCENT OF THE GORGE - SEVERAL SHOTS - DAY

To reach the camp site -- a beach at the base of the gorge -- the party
must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of
the sandstone cliffs. They have abandoned the wagon.

                    DISSOLVE TO:

326     EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

Sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here. The camp itself
consists of several lean-tos against the cliff wall. Above the camp,
reached by ladders connected to scaffolding, is the mouth of a cave.
Zira is cleaning up the breakfast things; Zaius and Lucius are sorting
out equipment.

A-326     CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND ZIRA

A small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of Taylor He has
nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife. Nova
watches, a look of fascinated approval on her face. Taylor rinses off
his knife, starts to dry it. Nova reaches out, gently strokes his
smooth -- if nicked -- chin.

          TAYLOR
          (smiling)
     You like it?

Lucius and Cornelius come up, Zira with them.

          LUCIUS
          (disapprovingly)
     Why did you do that? Scrape off your
     hair?

          TAYLOR
     In my world -- before I left it -
     only youngsters of your age wore un-
     scraped hair.

          CORNELIUS
          (to Taylor, quizzically)
     It makes you look somehow ... less
     intelligent.

Taylor grins wryly at Cornelius, picks up his rifle.

          TAYLOR
     When are you going to show me what's
     in the cave?

          CORNELIUS
     Right now, if you like.

They cross the beach to the ladders, when suddenly they hear the sound
of horses. They look o.s.

B-326     WHAT THEY SEE:

Dr. Zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner
of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks.

C-326     MEDIUM - THE GROUP

Taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold. Lucius runs to a lean-to,
scoops up his rifle.

          CORNELIUS
     Lucius -- don't fire at them.

The party rides up.

          ZAIUS
     You're all under arrest!
          (to Lucius)
     You seditious scoundrel. Drop that
     rifle.

327-     OUT

349     FLASH SHOT - LUCIUS

He wavers, lowering his piece.

350     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE BOTH GROUPS

Zaius' gorillas ride forward a few paces, but halt again as Taylor
shouts:

          TAYLOR
     Stop right there.

          ZAIUS
     Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered
     and outgunned.

Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out:

          TAYLOR
     If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius,
     you'll be the first to die. Depend
     on it.

          CORNELIUS
          (protesting)
     Taylor, you're not in command here.
     Put down that gun.

          TAYLOR
     Shut up.

Silence.     Zaius knows Taylor isn't bluffing.

          ZAIUS
     Very well.
          (to his followers)
     Lower your weapons.

They obey. Taylor calls again:

          TAYLOR
          (pointing)
     Tell them to move around the point.
     Out of range.

Zaius turns and whispers to his apes. They rein about and ride away
through the rocks. Zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone.
He is unarmed.

351     CLOSER ANGLE - THE GROUP

As Zaius draws nearer) Lucius lowers his rifle. But Taylor keeps his at
the ready.

          CORNELIUS
          (uncertainly)
     How did you know we'd come here?

          ZAIUS
     It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate
     or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden
     Zone.
          (a glance at Taylor)
     I see you brought along the female of
     your species.
          (Taylor nods)
     I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.

          TAYLOR
     On this planet -- it's easy.

Zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes.

          ZAIUS
          (evenly)
     I ask you to reconsider the rash course
     you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy,
     the most you'll get is two years. But if
     you persist in pointing guns in my direction,
     you'll hang for high treason.

          CORNELIUS
          (respectfully)
     We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.
          (pointing off)
     But up there, in the face of that Cliff,
     is a vast cave -- and in that cave a
     fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.

          ZAIUS
     I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
     They're worthless.

          TAYLOR
          (derisively)
     And that's your Minister of Science. Honor-
     bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

          ZIRA
          (worried)
     Taylor, please --

          TAYLOR
     Except that he's also the Chief Defender
     of the Faith.

          ZAIUS
          (loftily)
     There is no contradiction between faith
     and science. True science.

          TAYLOR
          (suddenly angered)
     All right, let's see if you're willing
     to put that statement to a test.

          CORNELIUS
     Taylor, I'd rather you -

          TAYLOR
     No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe
     I can pay you back.

          ZAIUS
          (calmly)
     What is your proposal?

          TAYLOR
     When were the Sacred Scrolls written?

          ZAIUS
     Twelve hundred years ago.

          TAYLOR
     Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove
     that those scrolls don't tell the whole
     truth of your history; if they can show you
     definite evidence of another culture from an
     unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?

          ZAIUS
     Of course.

          TAYLOR
     Okay.Up to the cave.

He gestures toward the path leading to it. Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius
start upward. Lucius starts to follow them.

          TAYLOR
     Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here
     and guard the horses.

          LUCIUS
     Always giving orders. Just like every
     other adult.

          TAYLOR
     Relax. You'll see it all later.

He pats the barrel of Lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but
benevolent non-com, then starts up the trail with Nova at his heels.
Lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him,
then shrugs, adjusting to the Idea.

352-
355     OUT

356      EXT. WESTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP
AFTERNOON

The sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon.
The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue.

357     EXT.  EASTERN WALL OF GORGE - LONG SHOT - ANGLING UP

The crenelated east wall, looking like a red cathedral, is aglow with
sunlight. So is the mouth of the cave as the three apes, Taylor and
Nova pass through it and o.s.

358     INT. CAVERN - BOOM SHOT - DAY

Nature has formed a vaulted room here. It need not be enormous, but
should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit.
There is an ape-made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet
square and eight feet deep. Some small objects lie on the rim of the
excavation. Zaius, Cornelius, Zira, Taylor and Nova enter from the
outside.

(AUTHOR'S NOTE: The effect should be an eyeful. I wish to create an
illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct,
refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern.)

          ZAIUS
     Present your evidence, Cornelius.

Cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira. Taylor bends
down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the
excavation. Nova sits beside him.

          CORNELIUS
          (pointing)
     It was at this level I discovered traces
     of an early ape creature -- stage of
     primitive barbarism, really -- dating back
     roughly thirteen hundred years. It was here
     I found cutting tools and arrowheads of
     quartz and the fossilized bones of
     carnivorous gorillas.

CAMERA (ON BOOM) MOVES IN SLOWLY as Cornelius continues:

          CORNELIUS
     But the artifacts lying at your feet
     were found here, at this level. And
     that's the paradox. The more ancient
     culture is the more advanced. Admittedly,
     many of these objects are unidentified,
     but clearly they were fashioned by beings
     with a knowledge of metallurgy.

CAMERA KEEPS MOVING IN on the group in and around the excavation as
Cornelius continues:

          CORNELIUS
     Indeed, the very fact that these tools
     are unknown to us could suggest a culture
     in certain ways almost equal to our own.
     Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...

          ZAIUS
          (interrupting)
     Don't speak to me in absolutes. The
     evidence is contestable.

          CORNELIUS
     I apologize.

          ZAIUS
     To begin with, your methods of dating
     the past are crude, to say the least. There
     are geologists on my staff who would laugh at
     your speculations.

          TAYLOR
     Perhaps that's why they're on your staff.

Zaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the
artifacts. He nudges them with his foot.

          ZAIUS
     Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call
     them, are unidentified, why are they
     introduced as 'evidence' of anything?

          ZIRA
          (promptly)
     But there's the doll, sir.

          ZAIUS
     What?

          CORNELIUS
          (pointing)
     Right there. The human doll.

Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up.

359     CLOSE ON DOLL - IN ZAIUS' HAND

It is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is
unmistakably the form of a human child.

          ZAIUS
     What does this prove? My grand-
     daughter plays with human dolls.

360     FULL SHOT - THE EXCAVATION - INCLUDING TAYLOR

Exasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation.

          ZIRA
     Taylor! Tell him.

          TAYLOR
     He has a point. On my planet children
     often play with ape dolls.

Zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova. She picks it up,
studies it.

361     GROUP SHOT - THE THREE APES

Cornelius tries again.

          CORNELIUS
     A doll alone proves nothing. True. But
     the doll was found beside the jawbone
     of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils
     has turned up in this deposit.

          ZAIUS
     Your conclusion is premature. Have you
     forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth
     Scroll?
          (quoting from memory)
     'And Proteus brought the upright beast
     into the garden, and chained him to a tree,
     and the children made sport of him.'

          CORNELIUS
          (impatiently)
     No sir, I haven't forgotten.

          ZAIUS
     Well? For a time the ancients kept humans
     as household pets.     Until the Lawgiver
     proved that man could not be tamed. Keep
     digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of
     the master of this house: an ape.

A-361     ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

As Zira again appeals to the man.

          ZIRA
     Are you going to let that pass without
     an answer?

Taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.

          TAYLOR
     Yes. I have to agree. From all you've
     found so far, his position's as good as
     yours.

          CORNELIUS
          (annoyed)
     What are you doing there?

          TAYLOR
     Reconstructing a life. Care to have a
     look?

Cornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the
excavation.

B-361     MED. CLOSE SHOT - FAVORING TAYLOR AND NOVA

As the apes come close. A number of artifacts have been arranged in
front of Taylor.

          TAYLOR
          (to Cornelius)
     These were found near the human doll,
     right?
          (Cornelius nods)
     Well, whoever owned them was in pretty
     bad shape.

He picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.

          TAYLOR
     Defective eyesight..

As Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by
one.

          TAYLOR
     He wore false teeth.
          (pause)
     He suffered from a hernia and used
     this truss to hold up his insides ...
          (pause)
     And toward the end, these little rings
     of stainless steel enclosed a prefab-
     ricated valve in his failing heart.

Taylor pauses. Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.

          TAYLOR
     I don't say he was a man like an Earthman,
     but I'd call him a close relative, for
     he was plagued by most of man's ills.
          (to Zaius pointedly)
     Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you
     -- and was superior to you.

          ZAIUS
          (a calm smile)
     That's lunacy. I can give an alternate
     description for everyone of those objects
     that's equally as inventive as yours. But
     it would be conjecture, not proof.

362     WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE TAYLOR AND NOVA

She is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll. From
it comes a distorted SOUND.

          DOLL'S HEAD
     Mamma! Mamma! Mamma!.

The apes stare at the doll in astonishment. Taylor snatches the doll
from Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius.

          TAYLOR
     Dr. Zaius! Would an ape make a human
     doll that talks?

Zaius looks at him, speechless. At that moment the CRACK of a distant
rifle shot reverberates through the cavern. All present freeze,
listening.

          ZIRA
     Lucius....

363-
364     OUT

365     FULL SHOT - THE CAVERN - REVERSE ANGLE

Taylor alone is armed. Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius.

          TAYLOR
     You louse!

Cornelius is already crossing the pit. He climbs out arid races toward
the mouth of the cave. Taylor runs after him. Zira and Nova hurry after
Taylor.

366     MED. SHOT - ZAIUS

Expressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth
of the cave.

367     EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE TO CAMP - ANGLING UP

Cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward
CAMERA. He halts in f.g., looking down at:

368     THE CAMP SITE - AS SEEN FROM THE TRAIL

Two of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with
their rifle butts. Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists'
horses back beyond the trees.

369     EXT. THE TRAIL - AS SEEN FROM THE BEACH

Cornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high
above, descending the trail. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO DISCLOSE A GORILLA
SNIPER in immediate f.g., crouching behind a boulder near the water. He
sights his rifle at the man on the trail. Taylor is still too distant
to make a sure target, and so the sniper waits.

370     CLOSER ANGLE - TAYLOR ON THE TRAIL

This portion of the trail has no cover or concealment. Unaware of the
sniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent.

371     LONG SHOT - TAYLOR - AS SEEN IN THE SNIPER'S SIGHTS

The gorilla fires.

372     CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR

The bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head. Taylor
scans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper. Nova comes to his
side, pointing at:

373     THE SNIPER - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

His head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece     .

374     FLASH SHOT

He aims and fires.

375     FLASH SHOT - THE SNIPER

Taylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder.

376     THE TRAIL - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA

Taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is
standing. Outcroppings of rock offer some  cover here. Taylor pushes
Nova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit.

377     CLOSE GROUP SHOT - TAYLOR, NOVA AND ZIRA

The sniper's SECOND SHOT rings out. Instead of returning the fire,
Taylor looks up the rail at:

378     ZAIUS - FRO14 TAYLOR'S P.O.V.

He is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the
mouth of the cave.

379     FLASH SHOT - TAYLOR

Bent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius. The sniper's
THIRD SHOT splatters rock fragments around him.

380     REVERSE ANGLE - THE TRAIL - ANGLING UP

Zaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some
loose shale. No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor
overtakes him. Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm.
Taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney. He spins
Zaius around, using him as a shield.

381     CLOSE TWO SHOT - ZAIUS AND TAYLOR

Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed
at his back.

     TAYLOR
     Tell him to pull back!

     ZAIUS
     (a hoarse cry)
     Cease fire! Withdraw!

His command echoes from the west wall of the canyon.

382     LONG SHOT - THE FLOOR OF THE GORGE - FROM THEIR P.O.V.

The sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off
along the beach.

383     BACK TO TAYLOR AND ZAIUS

Taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back
of Zaius' head.

          TAYLOR
     I ought to kill you right now.
          (nudging him)
     Let's go.

They move off down the trail.

384     EXT. ARCHEOLOGICAL CAMP - MED. SHOT - DAY

Zira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground. He
has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead. Nova and Cornelius come
next, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point. Lucius
appears to be more humiliated than hurt.

          LUCIUS
     They took me by surprise. Sneaked
     up on me while I was watering the
     horses. What's happened to honor?
          (pause, glum)
     I got off one round to warn you.

          CORNELIUS
          (gloomingly)
     They've taken everything.

          TAYLOR
     Not everything. They left a hostage.
          (a pause)
     How do you feel, Lucius?

          LUCIUS
     Disillusioned...
          (turning on)
     But vindicated! I've been right all
     along. You can't trust the older
     generation. It's a matter of values --

          TAYLOR
          (gently)
     All right, all right. Will You do me
     a favor? No orders.

          LUCIUS
          (pause)
     What is it?

          TAYLOR
     I want you to go around the bend and
     tell those gorillas their leader is my
     prisoner.

          LUCIUS
          (thoughtfull pause)
     Yes, I can do that.

          TAYL0R
     Good. Say I want a week's supply of food
     for the woman and myself. A horse. A spade.
     And fifty rounds of ammunition.

          LUCIUS
     What if they won't agree to your terms?

          TAYLOR
     Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave
     here alive.

          ZIRA
          (shocked)
     Taylor, you can't.

          ZAIUS
          (Calmly)
     Oh yes he can. He's a born killer.
     (to Lucius)
     Deliver the message.

Lucius looks to Taylor for confirmation. Taylor nods. The young ape
hurries away through the rocks. Taylor crosses to a useless saddle,
picks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree.

          TAYLOR
     Sit down. Over there.

Zaius squats on the ground beside the tree. Taylor sets his rifle
against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck.
Then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands
behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the
tree.

          TAYLOR
          (as he works)
     Now,      Minister of Science - let me explain
     certain principle stress and strain. If
     you exert pressure to remove these bonds,
     you'll choke yourself to death. It'll be
     suicide, you see?

Zira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin. Their rebellious
spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.

          ZIRA
     Taylor, please -- don't treat him that
     way.

          TAYLOR
     Why not?

          ZIRA
     It's humiliating.

          TAYLOR
     Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you?
     Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

          CORNELIUS
     That was different. We thought you
     were .... inferior.

          TAYLOR
          (wintry smile)
     And now you know the truth.
          (to Zaius)
     Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He
     proved it. Man preceded you here. You
     owe him your science, your language,
     whatever knowledge you have.

          ZAIUS
          (quietly)
     Then answer this: If ran was superior,
     why didn't he survive?

          TAYLOR
          (shrugging)
     He might have been wiped out by a plague.
     Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm
     of meteors. From the looks of this part
     of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

          ZIRA,
          (weakly)
     But we can't be sure.

          TAYLOR
          (indicating Zaius)
     He is. He knew all the time. Long before
     your discovery, he knew.
          (to Zaius)
     Defender of the Faith. Guardian of the
     terrible secret. Isn't that right, doctor?

385-
388      OUT

389     REVERSE ANGLE -     CIRCLE - FAVORING ZAIUS

As Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly.

          ZAIUS
     What I know of man was written long ago
     -- set down by the wisest ape of all --
     our Lawgiver.
          (to Cornelius)
     Open my breast pocket.

Cornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black
leather from the breast pocket of his tunic.

          ZAIUS
     Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll,
     ninth Verse.

Cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:

          CORNELIUS
     'Beware the beast man, for he is the
     devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates,
     he kills for sport, or lust or greed.
     Yes, he will murder his brother to possess
     his brother's land. Let him not breed
     in great numbers, for he will make a desert
     of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him
     back into his jungle lair: For he is the
     harbinger of death'.

Cornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius.

          ZAIUS
          (quietly)
     I found nothing in the cave to alter that
     conception of man. And I still live by its
     injunction.

A-389     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GROUP

Lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse. Zaius' five
mounted gorillas appear behind him. Taylor calls out to them:

          TAYLOR
     Stay where you      are!

Lucius comes up with the horse. Taylor checks the provisions in the
saddlebags. Lucius is frowning.

          LUCIUS
     They think you're behaving foolishly. I
     must say I agree. Where will you go?

          TAYLOR
          (nodding o.s.)
     I'll start by following the shoreline.
          (a smile)
     And my nose.

          ZIRA
     But suppose you find nothing but a
     wasteland. How will you survive?

          ZAIUS
          (firmly)
     He won't survive.
          (all look at him)
     Do you know what sort of life awaits
     you out there, Taylor? That of an animal.
     If you aren't eventually hunted down and
     killed by apes, some jungle beast will
     devour you.

          TAYLOR
     Then there is another jungle?

          ZAIUS
          (shrugs; then,
          sardonically)
     Of course, you could return with us. Our
     society might find a place for you and
     your mate.

          TAYLOR
     Sure.     In a cage.

          ZAIUS
     Where else, but in a cage, does man
     belong?

          TAYLOR
     No, thanks. I'll take freedom.

Taylor mounts the horse, extends a helping hand to Nova, who vault's
nimbly onto the horse's rump. Taylor looks at Zira and Cornelius.

          TAYLOR
     Would you like to come along?

          ZIRA
     We can't.

          TAYLOR
     It's better than going to prison for
     heresy.

          CORNELIUS
     They can't convict us of that. You
     proved our innocence. Besides...
          (indicating Zaius)
     ... his culture is our culture.

          TAYLOR
     Good luck then.

He reaches down, grasps Cornelius' hand, then grins crookedly.

          TAYLOR
     Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you
     good-bye.

          ZIRA
     All right, but....
          (tears in her eyes)
     ...you're so damned ugly!

Taylor smiles, leans down, kisses her.

          ZIRA
          (softly)
     Go with God, Taylor.
          (half smile)
     That's an old expression. it comes
     from both ape and man.

          TAYLOR
     God bless you.

He extends his hand to Lucius, who takes it.

          TAYLOR
     Lucius.

          LUCIUS
     I think you're making a mistake.

          TAYLOR
     That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.

          LUCIUS
     What?

          TAYLOR
     The flags of discontent. It's the only
     way anything ever gets changed.
          (to Zaius)
     Don't try to follow us.
          (pats stock of
          his rifle)
     I'm pretty handy with things like this.

          ZAIUS
     Of that I'm sure. All my life I've
     awaited your coming and dreaded it.
     Like death itself.

Taylor looks piercingly at Zaius, more troubled than offended.

          TAYLOR
     Why? From the first, I've terrified you,
     Doctor. And in spite of every sign that
     I'm an intelligent being who means no
     harm, you continue to hate and fear me.
     Why?

          ZAIUS
          (calmly,
          without rancor)
     Because you are a man. And you were right
     -- I have always known about man. From the
     evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk
     hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions
     must rule his brain. He must be a warlike
     animal who gives battle to everything around
     him -- even himself.

          TAYLOR
     What evidence? No weapons were found in
     the cave.

          ZAIUS
     The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise.
     Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.

          TAYLOR
          (he waits,
          then wearily)
     We're back at the beginning. I still don't
     know the why. A planet where apes evolved
     from men. A world turned wrong side up.
     A puzzle with one piece missing.

          ZAIUS
          (softly)
     Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not
     like what you find.

B-389     WIDER ANGLE - TAYLOR AND THE GROUP

Taylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's
flank. It canters off along the sandy shore.     Zira, Cornelius and
Lucius sadly watch the departure.

          ZAIUS
     Untie me!

Cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck. Behind
them, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward. Zaius gets up, waves
them to a halt.

          ZAIUS
     No, no! Let him go!

C-389     MOVING SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

Taylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows
his horse to a trot, smiles at Nova.

390-     OUT
405

406     MED. SHOT - THE APES

Zaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach.
Then he turns to an ape called MARCUS.

          ZAIUS
          (quietly)
     Fetch your explosives. We're going
     to seal the cave.

          MARCUS
     Yes, sir.

He remounts his horse and rides o.s.

          CORNELIUS
          (aghast)
     Seal the cave?

          ZAIUS
     That's correct. And you will both stand
     trial for heresy.

          ZIRA
     But the proof? The doll?

          ZAIUS
     In a few minutes there will be no doll.
     There can't be.
          (honest regret)
     I'm sorry.

Cornelius throws himself at Zaius.

          CORNELIUS
     You mustn't! You gave your 'word!

Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes.

          ZAIUS
     What I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence
     him.

A hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth. He is dragged off,
struggling, kicking. Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius.

          LUCIUS
     Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must
     knowledge stand still? What about the
     future?

Zaius looks benevolently at Julius.

          ZAIUS
     I may just have saved it for you.

Julius and Zira look at each other, befuddled. Once more their eyes
follow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova. The beach separating
the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream.

          LUCIUS
     What will he find out there, doctor?

A-406     CLOSEUP - ZAIUS

His face is A mask, his tone enigmatic.

          ZAIUS
     His destiny.

B-406     WIDER ANGLE - TIE APES P.O.V.

A moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend.

407-     OUT
408

409     EXT. PALISADE AND BEACH - LONG HIGH ANGLE SHOT - DAY

Taylor and Nova are already far downstream. There is a striking change
in the terrain. The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be
     seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened
to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea.

A NOTE ON PRODUCTION: If feasible at new location site, this scene
should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the
cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.

410     CLOSER ANGLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

He is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation. Hearing
the CRIES of birds, he reins in and looks' up.

411     SKY SHOT - CIRCLING BIRDS

Sea gulls are soaring overhead.

412     TWO SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA ON HORSEBACK

His expression is expectant, searching. Nova emits a whimper of
anticipation, pointing off.

413     LONG SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE:

A verdant forest atop a distant palisade. Their view of the beach below
the forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance.

414     CLOSE SHOT - NOVA AND TAYLOR

He smiles at her hopefully.

          TAYLOR
     Yes, Nova -- I see it.
          (looks again at
          forest)
     In my old profession green meant
     safe. Green meant go.

The horse moves off at a trot, CAMERA PANNING. But they have gone only
a short distance when they hear the distant THUNDER of an EXPLOSION.
Taylor reins in and looks back.

415     VERY LONG SHOT - A CLOUD OF SMOKE

A column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream.

416     BACK TO TAYLOR AND NOVA

Frowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then
decides this is no time to linger. He digs his heels into the horse's
flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that
splits the beach. They are nearing the promontory that blocks their
view of the beach beyond.

417-     OUT
418

419     CLOSER ANGLE - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR AND NOVA.

As they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes
into view. it appears to be jutting from the sea.

420     REACTION SHOT - TAYLOR

He reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees. Then he rides on.

421     THE STRANGE FORMATION - AS SEEN BY TAYLOR

An immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle. We can
now see that it is not rock, but metal. Green metallic tints show
through its gray salt-stained surface. As we draw closer, the object
takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand
holding a torch.

422     REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR

Frowning with consternation. His horse proceeds at a slow walk.

423     TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - WHAT HE SEES:

Near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row
of metal spikes. From this angle they look like tank traps.

A-423     CLOSER - TAYLOR

Dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the  spikes. Nova
dismounts and follows him.

          TAYLOR
          (a cry of agony)
     My God!

He falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands. CAMERA SLOWLY
DRAWS BACK AND UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT disclosing what Taylor has
found. Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of
Liberty.

424-     OUT
451

                    FADE OUT
