Cat and mouse.
Jonathan McQuarry is an auditor in Manhattan, moving from office to office checking their books.
While working late, a smooth and well-dressed man named Wyatt Bose chats Jonathan up, offers him a joint, and soon they're pals.
When their cell phones are accidentally swapped, Jonathan answers Wyatt's phone to a series of women asking if he's free tonight.
Jonathan discovers it's a sex club: busy powerful people meet each other anonymously in hotels.
Jonathan falls for one of the club members, whom he knows only as "S," whom he's also seen on a subway.
When she goes missing, patterns emerge and Jonathan faces demands involving violence and lots of money.
