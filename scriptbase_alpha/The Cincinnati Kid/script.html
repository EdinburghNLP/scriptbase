<b>                                    THE CINCINNATI KID
</b>


                                        Written by

                           Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern


                                   Based on a novel by

                                      Richard Jessup





<b>                                                   SHOOTING DRAFT - 1965
</b>
<b>                
</b>
<b>               FADE IN: SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY
</b>
               Exterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside 
               industrial district. Even more important to establish than 
               the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters 
               would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes 
               as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of 
               Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."

<b>               EXT. FACTORY - DAY
</b>
               One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket 
               line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is 
               anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct 
               conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance 
               open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a 
               small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this 
               that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets 
               or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction 
               pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault 
               them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, 
               dirty and noisy.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
</b>
               The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are 
               clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the 
               SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening 
               on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER 
               of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                         Somebody shut the goddam window. Let 
                         a man think.

               The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also 
               owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. 
               Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table 
               look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, 
               extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself 
               the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid 
               have almost all the money on the table between them, about a 
               hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more 
               than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, 
               there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are 
               left in the hand.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                         Possible straight gets a --
                              (deals the card)
                         -- lovely little four.

<b>                                     FIRST PLAYER
</b>                         On the last hand even, you couldn't 
                         give me a break.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                         I put the brakes on your straight, 
                         didn't I?
                              (he laughs; no one 
                              else does; he deals 
                              to The Kid)
                         There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         Thanks.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                              (deals to Danny)
                         And our lucky friend from Chicago 
                         gets a queen with his pair of sixes. 
                         Little lady make you happy, Buster?

<b>                                     DANNY
</b>                         Deal to yourself, clown.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                         Dealer gives himself a --
                              (deals card and groans)
                         I might have known.
                              (to Danny)
                         Bet your sixes, Buster.

<b>                                     DANNY
</b>                         I told you not to call me that.
                              (then as the dealer 
                              turns away)
                         Cost you --
                              (counts out his money)
                         Ninety-four bucks.

<b>                                     DEALER
</b>                         Biggest pot of the whole game, I got 
                         to drop.

<b>                                     DANNY
</b>                              (to First Player)
                         Interested?

<b>                                     FIRST PLAYER
</b>                         Wouldn't call you if I had a pair 
                         higher'n sixes. Which I ain't.

               He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         Don't seem like he'd bet out without 
                         something better than the sixes, 
                         does it?
                              (fingers hole card as 
                              if to fold)
                         Cost me every cent I've won since 
                         yesterday afternoon.
                              (studies Danny's face)
                         But I tell you, I got this stubborn 
                         streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.

               He counts out the money, which is almost all he has.

<b>                                     DANNY
</b>                              (indignantly)
                         You can't have better than a pair of 
                         kings!

<b>                                     KID
</b>                         Oh, I'm not claiming anything that 
                         fine.
                              (turns over an eight, 
                              making a pair of 
                              them)
                         Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.

<b>                                     DANNY

                              (indicating Dealer)
                         He was dealing them high.

               Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in 
               the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. 
               Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely 
               in the face.

<b>                                     DANNY

                         left behind them -- Buster.

               He stands up.

                         think you had another pair or another

                         get greedy and try and buy the last

               He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."

               He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, 
               his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to 
               his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor 
               appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the 
               wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor 
               in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right 
               hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves 
               the razor blade against his neck.

               As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the 
               door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough 
               momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, 
               dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles 
               his way out through a window.

               Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door 
               just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to 
               get out of the building and after The Kid.

               The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. 
               The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to 
               run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny 
               and four other poker players appear and run after him.

               The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The 
               Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and 
               they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track 
               on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the 
               station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting 
               beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst 
               of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger 
               train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the 
               train into the depot.

               The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival 
               in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in 
               travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag 
               from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before 
               he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers 
               and Red Caps toward the center of the station.

                         my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it

               The Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends 
               into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small 
               portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and 
               down the Mississippi.

               the river, watching the working boats. They have their 
               thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar.

               Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, 
               turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g. 
               The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes 
               closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He 
               opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches 
               her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid 
               the noise has disturbed him.

               She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on

               to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting 
               for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not 
               till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his

               MELBA, The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on

               from the radio. But the radio is across the room and it's 
               slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed 
               she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens 
               this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, 
               reading a magazine. He turns around inquiringly.

               about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played

               couple of bottles of wine on ice, fine cigars, a tray of 
               sandwiches, etc. Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types; 
               two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good-
               looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as 
               nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four 
               remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end 
               up with four cards of one suit showing.

               He is standing by an elevator in f.g. keeping watch on a row

               an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality

               to shake the can with corn in it. After a bit he brings in 
               the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent 
               the rustle of the first can.

               At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, 
               delicate voice. It is catfish music created on the spot and 
               sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum.

               small duffel bag, and walks to the door that leads to the 
               busses. He goes out into the night and gets into a bus.

               A bus drives along a main road in the Ozarks, heading toward 
               CAMERA. As it comes close, the name of its destination: 
               "FAYETTEVILLE" can be read.

               The bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings 
               around an intersection. The Kid is the only passenger to get 
               off here. As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an 
               attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question. 
               Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, 
               he crosses and goes into it. The STOREKEEPER comes back 
               outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to 
               go. It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the 
               store. The Kid starts up the road.

               The Kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the 
               crossroads, and looks down into the valley between this hill 
               and the next one. He starts down an even narrower road leading 
               to a little farm on a hillock in the valley. It consists of 
               a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a 
               few cultivated fields.

               Christian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the 
               house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke 
               over her shoulder. A little dog YAPS and runs from the front 
               door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that

               MRS. CRAIGIE, Christian's mother, opens the door for them, 
               giving The Kid a sharp, appraising glance.

               Christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns 
               her back. Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the 
               drain board. She and Christian each take a can and pour the 
               water from it to prime the pump.

                         the middle of canning.

               The Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming 
               pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers 
               of green beans.

                         bread in the warmer, if you're hungry 
                         Eric.

               As soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and 
               Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems 
               and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove.

               The Kid looks quickly at her and then at Mrs. Craigie, who 
               keeps her gaze fixed on the beans.

               banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled

               The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs. 
               Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars 
               they filled earlier. The paste and some of the jars are just 
               inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. The 
               light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.

               The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck 
               in his pocket. During the next few lines he uses the paste 
               on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to 
               form three double-thick cards. One of these has two faces,

                         on both sides, one is red on both 
                         sides, and the other is white on one 
                         side, red on the other.

               The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.

</b>                         This. I put the three cards in a hat 
                         and shake them up, and then I ask 
                         you to draw one card out blind. Put 
                         it face down on the table so neither 
                         of us can see the bottom side.

               Craigie does as instructed. The ensuing dialogue assumes the 
               card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" 
               and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.

                         the all-white card, right. So the 
                         card you've picked is one of two -- 
                         the all-red or the red-and-white. 
                         One out of two is an even chance, an 
                         even-money proposition. Right -- you

               to look at the doorway. He glances in the same direction in

               The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a

               down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, 
               tight and cushioned by the blanket. The Kid presses his

               Lancey is completely calm. Pig is shattered, his whole world 
               suddenly blown apart.

                         care to raise me.

               All eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for 
               him. He just sits there, his hands shaking.

               He looks at Lancey with malevolence. Lancey turns over his 
               up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly 
               lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole 
               card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards 
               into the pack The Shooter is assembling.

               Pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages 
               of making the dread admission. Finally he nods. The Shooter 
               takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other 
               four remaining players each add a ten. The Shooter pushes 
               the money toward Pig.

               The other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going 
               to accept this statement at face value. He nods, that he 
               does, and each man contributes another ten. The Shooter passes 
               the second fifty to Pig.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the door. The spectators make room for 
               him, no one saying anything. At the door, Pig turns back for 
               his valedictory gesture.

               There is $2500 in the pot. Lancey shows a pair of kings, The 
               Kid an ace and three odd cards. The Shooter deals a nine to 
               Lancey.

               The dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as The Shooter 
               gives The Kid an ace. Lancey's hand reaches into the SHOT to 
               turn over his up cards.

               He takes the money in slowly, his eyes on The Shooter. Now 
               the distribution of money has been reversed. The Kid has 
               something under $12,000, Lancey something under $8,000.

               On the fourth card Lancey shows a pair of sevens, The Kid a 
               pair of eights and a ten.

               The Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten.

               Again there is no indication of improper dealing as The 
               Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing 
               his full house.

               He exits. After a moment The Shooter follows. Lancey watches 
               them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong. Lady

               Melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes 
               into the SHOT, takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him 
               after he opens the shower door. He gives himself a quick

               She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of 
               the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the 
               bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his 
               undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using 
               the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and 
               puts on his shorts and trousers.

               He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his 
               movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes 
               he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting

               To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both

               the cards down.

               other for a moment, then both grin.

               As he heads for the door, Lancey reacts to this. Then stands 
               and looks around the room. Groups of people stand in the 
               shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not 
               friendly. He is The Man but he is getting beat and nobody is

<b>               INT. BILL'S SUITE

               Bill and The Kid are sitting at a room-service table. Bill 
               nibbles at some cheese and crackers while The Kid tackles a 
               large steak. Felix, the chauffeur, stands in attendance on 
               them.

                         Felix!

               He motions to Felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table. 
               Felix steps over and refills The Kid's glass.

</b>                         Are you saying no before we've even 
                         discussed it? Am I to feel all my 
                         arguments will be wasted?

               The Kid just looks at him -- then returns to his meal.

</b>                         I'll skip to the final argument.
                              (then)
                         More salad, perhaps?

               He makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward 
               to offer the salad bowl to The Kid.

</b>                         The Shooter will be back dealing 
                         when you start again. He will give 
                         you an occasional helpful card.

</b>                         Is that knife sharp enough? Felix.

               Felix jumps into action again. He moves to The Kid's side, 
               reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, 
               which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck. It 
               is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon.

</b>                         See if it cuts better with that.

               Felix hands the knife to The Kid, who tries it on his steak.

                         me.

               He jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade.

               Christian looks at them, then at The Kid. Hesitates a moment 
               then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door. Only

               and Lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly

               strong handicap for the long pull. Then his face settles as 
               if he had come to a decision. He smiles lightly summoning 
               some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this 
               will be the last hand, win or lose.

               There is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he 
               reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated 
               strain and fatigue is beginning to show. CAMERA MOVES among 
               the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid 
               and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at 
               his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a 
               very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is 
               balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to 
               The Shooter and possibly to her.
