UNIVERSE - EIGHT BILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH

The cosmos on the grandest scale we know.  Clusters of
galaxies strewn like sea froth; whorls and smudges of
light representing hundreds of billions of stars each.

MILKY WAY GALAXY

A view from the edge.  We DRIFT ABOVE the majestic,
spiraling disk, tens of thousands of light years across.

RING NEBULA (M57) - CONSTELLATION LYRA

A local group of stars, the brightest of which is a point
of hot, blue-white light...

VEGA

Rings of glowing gas and debris surround the giant, blue-
white star... and then we notice something ahead of us in
polar orbit.

CLOSER

An immense, world-sized construct gleams in Vega's blue
light.  Far too big to be artificial, by human standards
-- but this wasn't built to human standards.

Bowl-shaped transmitters cover the quicksilver gel-like
surface of the polyhedron, forming then vanishing again.
We DESCEND INTO one vast bowl as it deepens --

-- then silently convulses.  A lost chord.  We SWING
AROUND, assuming a breathtaking, MOVING POV --

A message begins its journey.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

SUBTERRANEAN DARKNESS

Shadows appear, dark and murky.  Slowly we become aware of
a MUFFLED, PULSING sound; like a DISTANT, BOOMING
HEARTBEAT.

Suddenly a bright light unzips the amniotic darkness; two
great hands reach in to assist what we now realize is a
Caesarean birth.

ELLIE ARROWAY

age five seconds, opens her eyes wide.  In the b.g., we
can see a nurse methodically giving CPR to the unseen
mother; the decor beyond tells us we are in a small-town
doctor's office.  The DOCTOR holds Ellie as he calls
softly to the nurse.

                         DOCTOR
          You can call it, Nan.  Mark time of
          birth as... 12:04 A.M.
                  (looking down at the
                   baby)
          Happy New Year, little lady.
                  (to the nurse)
          Tell Ted he has a girl.

TED ARROWAY stands watching through the window in the
office door.  Numb.

BABY'S TINY HAND

clasps its mother's finger.

                                            CUT TO:

WIDE TABLEAU

Ted, holding his newborn daughter, sitting quietly next to
the bed where his sheet-covered wife still lies.

EXT.  MAIN STREET (NEHALEM, OREGON) - DAWN

Ted, carefully holding little Ellie, walks down the empty
street, his FOOTSTEPS ECHOING...

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

rockets through a black dust cloud where young stars are
just beginning to glow.  An icy worldlet evaporates,
releasing gasses which blow away in spectral bursts of
iridescent color...

SURFACE OF ALIEN WORLD

We are MOVING OVER an exotic, technological landscape;
strange ALIEN SQUELCHES and SQUEALS become audible --

-- and then a child's hand reaches in and twists a giant
dial on what we now see is an old shortwave RADIO.

                         ELLIE (V.O.)
          CQ CQ WR2 GFO... WR2 GFO, come back.

INT.  ARROWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

SIX-YEAR OLD ELLIE leans in towards a large microphone.

                         ELLIE
          CQ WR2 GFO, do you copy?
                  (calls)
          I'm not getting anything.

Ted joins his daughter at the workbench where she sits in
front of the short-wave, her feet dangling from the stool.
He puts his hands on her shoulders.

                         TED
          Small moves, Captain, small moves.

                         ELLIE
          I can't move any smaller.

                         TED
          Try again between the static and
          'Hey Jude'; that's where they're
          hiding.

Ellie bites her lip, tries again.  Her little hand slowly
turns the dial -- suddenly --

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          Copy... WRS GFO...
                  (off STATIC)
          W2P KLD talking... what's your
          handle, WR2 GFO?

                         ELLIE
          What do I do?

                         TED
          Talk to him.

                         ELLIE
          But what do I say?

                         TED
          Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out
          where he is.

Ellie tentatively reaches out and grasps the microphone.

                         ELLIE
          Where are you calling from, W2P KLD,
          come back.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          Pensacola, over.

                         ELLIE
          Pensacola -- !
                  (beat)
          Where's Pensacola?

                         TED
          Give you a hint:  orange juice.

MAP OF WORLD

above the work area is dotted with colored pins; Ellie's
finger traces the Gulf of Mexico, stopping at Pensacola.

Ellie, breathless with wonder.  Contact.

EXT.  ARROWAY BEDROOM - NIGHT

The house in the woods dwarfed under the immense dome of
night.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Now in her pajamas, Ellie sits hunched over in bed,
working intently on her latest masterpiece.  A crayon
behind her ear.

                         ELLIE
          Could we hear to China?

                         TED
          On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a
          clear night.  Come on now, under the
          covers.

                         ELLIE
          Could we hear to the moon?

                         TED
          Big enough radio, I don't see why
          not.

                         ELLIE
          Could we hear God?

                         TED
          Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his
          echo...
                  (then)
          Okay, no more stalling.

                         ELLIE
                  (coloring frantically)
          Okay, okay... there.

She hands Ted the drawing.  As he holds it up to the lamp
we see it shows an idealized beach, palm trees.  It glows
in the light.

                         ELLIE
          Pensacola.

                         TED
          That's a beauty, Captain.
                  (kisses her on the
                   forehead)
          Now get some sleep.

He carefully pins the drawing on the wall, turns out the
light.  As he starts out she says softly --

                         ELLIE
          Do you think there're people on
          other planets?

Ted pauses, smiles at his daughter's inexhaustible
curiosity.  He returns, sits on the edge of her bed, now
lit by starlight.

                         TED
          Well let's see... the Universe is a
          pretty big place... And the one
          thing I know about nature is it
          hates to waste anything.  So I guess
          I'd say if it is just us, an awful
          lot of space is going to waste.

He tenderly brushes a stray lock of her hair behind her
ear.

                         TED
          Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you
          can ask more questions in the
          morning, okay?

                         ELLIE
                  (sighs)
          Okay.

He kisses her again, rises, goes to leave, stopping at the
door to watch her.  Ellie looks out the window at the
stars...

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

A comet blows by.  We chase it, riding its luminous tail
of evaporating ice...

TED'S CALLUSED HAND

careful as a safecracker, slowly TURNS the DIAL on an
ancient A.M. RADIO -- finally landing on an old HANK
WILLIAMS TUNE.

INT.  TED'S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

Ted sits up, smiles in satisfaction.

EXT.  TRUCK - DAY

The old red Ford trundles through the pines along a
mountain road.

INT.  ARROWAY KITCHEN - DAY

NINE-YEAR OLD ELLIE throws her schoolbooks on the table
and goes to the refrigerator.  As she starts to take out
items we see her hand-drawn chart taped to the side of the
fridge; Mondays and Thursdays say "Ellie Cooks!"

EXT.  MOUNTAINS - DAY

A fawn is feeding.  CUT WIDE to reveal it standing in the
middle of an empty road, nibbling at the grass growing out
of the old blacktop.  The TWITTER of a BIRD; the wind in
the trees... and then, far in the distance, we hear an
ENGINE STRAINING.

LOGGING TRUCK

heads up the mountain road, its driver humming along to
the same HANK WILLIAMS TUNE.

INT.  ARROWAY KITCHEN - DAY

A stew of some sort bubbles on the stove.  Ellie hums as
she experiments with every spice on the rack.

SERIES OF SHOTS

A)  Ted sings to the RADIO as he eases off the gas to
    take a bend in the road --

B)  The fawn continues to graze, oblivious.  We can now
    hear the RADIO in the DISTANCE.

C)  Ted look up as he rounds the bend -- sees the deer --

D)  The logging TRUCK ROARS around a blind curve --

E)  Ted swerves onto the wrong side of the road, misses
    the deer, sighs in relief --

F)  The truck driver looks up, sees the Ford coming at
    him, Ted still looking over his shoulder at --

FAWN

who suddenly looks up at the O.S. sound of a HORRIBLE
CRASH --

-- then bounds off into the woods.

INT.  ARROWAY KITCHEN - DUSK

The table is set.  A stubby candle and some wildflowers in
a peanut-butter jar.

Ellie sits at her place, frowning.  She glances up at the
wall clock -- and then slowly stands as she sees something
else THROUGH the kitchen window:

A sheriffs' car is pulling up, lights going, siren silent.
The sheriff looks up -- their eyes meet -- PUSH IN ON
Ellie --

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

Little cones of light illuminate the darkness as NEIGHBORS
search with their flashlights, calling:

                         NEIGHBORS
          Ellie... Ellie...?

EXT.  ARROWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

The sheriff stands in front of the house, shaking his head
as he talks to a MINISTER.  VOICES continue to CALL.

We start to CRANE UP, HIGHER and HIGHER until we clear the
house -- REVEALING Ellie lying on the roof, staring up at
the stars.  Her fingers grip the shingles...

EXT.  COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY

The Minister kneels next to Ellie, watching her knead
another piece of bread into a ball before tossing it into
a small fish pond.  In the b.g. we see the sheriff and
several relatives watching.

                         MINISTER
          I'm so sorry, Ellie.  More than I
          can ever say.

Ellie keeps watching the pond.  The clouds overhead are
reflected in the patches of water between the lily pads.

                         ELLIE
          Those lily pads must look like
          clouds to that carp, don't you
          think?

The Minister frowns.  Gently:

                         MINISTER
          Ellie... this life doesn't last
          forever.  Some day you and your Dad
          are going to be together again, in
          heaven.

                         ELLIE
                  (turns to him;
                   equally gentle)
          He isn't in heaven; he's in the
          ground.  We just put him there,
          remember?

OFF the astonished Minister --

INT.  ARROWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

Relatives, townspeople, the Minister and sheriff mingle
quietly.  The kitchen table and counters are covered with
a sea of casseroles.

Ellie watches the gathered from a doorway, then slips
away.

INT.  ARROWAY HOUSE - WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT

Ellie slowly approaches the darkened bench area where the
SHORTWAVE is set up; the pin-dotted map above it.  She
TURNS it ON; the dial glows.

She reaches out for the microphone, holding it tightly in
both hands.  Pushes the button.

                         ELLIE
          CQ WR2, this is GFO, do you copy?
                  (looking up)
          Dad, this is Ellie, come back.

EXT.  HOUSE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Tiny Ellie is visible THROUGH the window, and as we begin
to PULL UP and AWAY her emotion-choked voice continues,
small and faraway...

                         ELLIE (V.O.)
          This is Eleanor Arroway broadcasting
          on 9.2 megahertz.  Dad, are you
          there?  Come back.  Come back.  Come
          back...

                                            CUT TO:

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

-- rockets through the Rosette Nebula, a vast cloud of
glowing red hydrogen illuminated by young hot stars a
hundred times brighter than the sun.  Their solar wind is
blowing out an immense cavity in the interstellar gas and
dust.

PALM LEAF

lies on the streetlamp-lit sidewalk.

We hear the sound of a BUS PULLING UP, its door opening.
After a moment a pair of sneakered feet tentatively step
INTO FRAME.  A suitcase is set down next to them as we
hear the BUS WHEEZE OFF into the night.  A hand reaches
down, picks up the palm leaf.

22-YEAR-OLD ELLIE examines it, then looks up in
apprehension at the old prewar Spanish structure of Cal
Tech.

INT.  CAMPUS BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Ellie's FOOTSTEPS ECHO as she walks down a corridor, its
walls hung with portraits of Galileo, Copernicus, Hubble.
She pauses at a photograph of Einstein standing outside
the entrance we just saw.  Sound up cut:  THE RAMONES' "I
Wanna Be Sedated" --

INT.  DORM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

An altogether different sort of hallway, reflecting the
imagination and individuality of its occupants.  The walls
are covered with whimsical graffiti ("anthropocentrism is
a 17 letter word;"  "WATCH FOR FLYING POTATOES") and 3
A.M. paintings of alien sunsets; the MUSIC is coming from
behind a door covered in Tolkien and comic book art.

As Ellie enters this strange new world she begins to hear
animated voices coming from a room at the end of the hall.

                         VOICE #1 (V.O.)
          ... radio luminosity?

                         VOICE #2 (V.O.)
          I dunno, maybe a post-spectral
          starburst or something.

                         EVERYBODY (V.O.)
          Right, right --

                         VOICE #3 (V.O.)
          E+A is an elliptical?  How can you
          tell it's being lensed?  Pass me the
          Fruity Pebbles.

                         VOICE #4 (V.O.)
          Well I guess you'd have to check
          other elliptical galaxies, Mr.
          Wizard --

INT.  DORM ROOM - NIGHT

As Ellie peers around the corner we see six or seven
STUDENTS, mostly male, of mixed nationality and race,
passing around cereal which they eat from the box.  A
primitive (circa 1980) home-built personal computer glows
in the b.g.; a door opens onto a terrace and the
California night beyond.  They stop, look up at Ellie --

                         ELLIE
          I -- uh --
                  (clears her throat)
          I was looking for Koestler Hall?

                         GUY (STUDENT)
          This is it.  Hey, do you know the
          average radio-luminosity of an E+A
          elliptical galaxy?

                         ELLIE
          Um... I'm not sure.
                  (hesitates)
          Maybe you could deduce it from
          lensing a post-spectral
          starburst...?

                         GUY
                  (beat, then to his
                   friend)
          See, I told you!
                  (to Ellie)
          Want some Fruity Pebbles?
          Carcinogenic, but totally worth it.

Ellie takes the box, and as she tentatively enters the
room -- nibbles on the cereal -- she slowly sits.  Smiles.
The argument rages on.  She's home.

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

We ROAR by a rapidly rotating, flashing pulsar.  Cosmic
dust filters the light into the shifting spectrum of
colors...

EXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY

DAVID DRUMLIN, 42, fit, sardonic -- and the world's
foremost radio astronomer -- leads a group of grad
students past the first Jet Propulsion Lab radio
telescopes at Goldstone.  Ellie lags behind talking to
PETER VALERIAN, who is about as good-looking as an
astronomer should be allowed to be.

                         ELLIE
          ... Drumlin said you're been down at
          Arecibo for the last year.

                         PETER
          It's beautiful but it does get a
          little lonely.  Sometimes I think
          the reason we build these things in
          such godforsaken places isn't to
          avoid excess radio traffic but
          because we're all such pathetic
          antisocial misfits... Speaking of
          which:  How're you getting on with
          the old man?

                         ELLIE
          He's an incredible prick but I never
          learned so much in my life.

                         PETER
                  (smiles)
          That's what they all say.

In the b.g. we can see the majestic twin dishes tilted up
toward the hard blue sky.  An awkward moment, which Ellie
fills by extending her hand.

                         ELLIE
          Ellie.  Arroway.

                         PETER
          Peter Valerian.

                         ELLIE
          Sounds like a Russian general.

                         PETER
          Yavol.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (calling back)
          You're out of shape, Valerian.
          What's the matter, eat too many
          tacos down there in Puerto Rico?

He pronounces it "tackos" in his distinctive Montana
twang.

                         ELLIE
          I read your paper on ETI's.  It's
          brilliant.

                         PETER
                  (embarrassed but
                   pleased)
          Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks
          I'm enough of a flake as it is.
                  (then)
          Look -- everyone here has their
          little fetishes.  Caven goes to
          topless bars, Vernon's got his
          carnivorous plants... mine just
          happens to be extraterrestrial
          intelligence.

                         ELLIE
          What a coincidence.  It happens to
          be my fetish too.

A brief but electric moment between them.  They both feel
it.  Drumlin calls back from the head of the group:

                         DRUMLIN
          You two coming along or you just
          gonna do it right here in the sand?

The other students laugh good-naturedly.  Ellie and Peter,
rather than being embarrassed, seem to be considering the
idea.

EXT.  MOJAVE CLIFFS - LATE AFTERNOON

A dusky orange sun hangs over the mountains, the Goldstone
telescopes visible in the distance.  Ellie and Peter walk
along a windswept cliff overlooking a vast desert lake.

                         ELLIE
          ... I'm just so sick of feeling
          defensive about the things I care
          about!  Or being lumped in with the
          lunatic fringe by people like
          Drumlin, when if they'd just put
          aside their preconceptions for two
          seconds and look at the facts...

                         PETER
          They can't.  I think it's against
          human nature to admit to that level
          of... insignificance; to not see
          yourself as basically the center of
          the universe.

                         ELLIE
          It's like the pre-Copernicans who
          swore the sun revolved around the
          Earth, or the Victorians at the end
          of the last century who concluded
          that all major discoveries had now
          been made.  I mean... try to imagine
          civilization a thousand years ahead
          of us -- then imagine trying to
          explain... I dunno, a microwave oven
          -- to someone even a hundred years
          ago -- I mean the basic concepts
          didn't exist...

                         PETER
                  (murmurs)
          'Any sufficiently advanced
          technology...'

                         ELLIE
                  (finishing it with
                   him)
          '... is indistinguishable from
          magic.'

A moment... and then Peter takes her hand like it's the
most natural thing in the world.

                         PETER
          I dunno.  I know I should be
          objective, ice-cold hard-assed
          scientific about it, but just on an
          intuitive level -- what's the point
          of a universe so vast if we're the
          only ones it it?  It'd just be such
          a... waste of space.

Ellie stops, looks at him -- and then slowly, carefully
leans in and kisses him.  A pleasantly awkward beat.

                         ELLIE
          Sorry.

Peter laughs.

EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT

A million stares blaze overhead as Peter and Ellie make
love on an Indian blanket in the middle of the desert.
Ellie looks searchingly up into Peter's face... and then
her gaze drifts upwards to the canopy above...

SQUIRREL

gnaws on a beechnut as two enormous pair of feet walk by.

                         ELLIE (V.O.)
          -- but I've already submitted my
          proposal!

EXT.  CAL TECH CAMPUS - DAY

Ellie and Drumlin walk briskly, in heated discussion.

                         DRUMLIN
          I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is
          it too Speculative a subject for a
          doctoral dissertation, at this point
          in your career it'd be tantamount to
          suicide.

                         ELLIE
          I'm willing to take that risk.

                         DRUMLIN
          I'm not.  You're far too promising a
          scientist to waste your considerable
          gifts on this nonsense --

                         ELLIE
          Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about
          what could potentially be the most
          important discovery in the history
          of humanity.  There are over four
          hundred billion stars out there --

                         DRUMLIN
          And only two probabilities:  One:
          there is intelligent life in the
          universe but they're so far away
          you'll never contact it in your
          lifetime --

                         ELLIE
          You're --

                         DRUMLIN
          Two:  There's nothing out there but
          noble gasses and carbon compounds
          and you'd be wasting your time.

                         ELLIE
          What if you're wrong?
                  (as he starts to
                   speak)
          No -- I'll grant you probabilities
          but as a scientist without all the
          evidence -- you can't deny the
          possibility -- and I believe even
          the remotest possibility of
          something this profoundly...
          profound is worth investigation --
          and worth taking a few risks.

                         DRUMLIN
          I disagree.

                         ELLIE
          Then disagree but don't stand in my
          way!

By this point they've gathered a small crowd.  Drumlin
regards her for for a moment; then, softly:

                         DRUMLIN
          What is it that makes you so lonely,
          Miss Arroway?  What is it that
          compels you to search the heavens
          for life when there's so much of it
          being neglected right here at home?

Body blow.  Ellie just stares, stunned.  Finally:

                         DRUMLIN
          I will approve a general thesis on
          the detection of radio signals from
          space but that's all.  No E.T.I.s.
          Enough?

Flushed, overwhelmed... Ellie nods.  Enough.

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

Approaching a backwater area of the galaxy.  A small,
unspectacular yellow star comes INTO VIEW.

PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS

cuts through the night.  A Jeep negotiates an overgrown
mountain road.

EXT.  ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO - AERIAL SHOT - PRE-DAWN

The two tiny beams from high above as we DESCEND OVER a
mountainous jungle range, a hot-house of life that drops
away to reveal an enormous white thousand-foot radio
telescope, cradled in the natural bowl of the mountain
valley.

SUPERIMPOSE:  ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO - 1992

EXT.  ARECIBO - DAWN

The mud-spattered Jeep pulls up in front of the living
quarters of the primitive installation.  Peter Valerian
climbs out, looks up at the crude facilities in dismay.

ELLIE

lies asleep in bed.  Peter sits quietly next to her,
gently touches her face.  Her eyes slowly open.  She
smiles.

SAME - FEW MINUTES LATER

Ellie is in the shower.  Peter looks around her quarters;
peeling paint, a few steps down from your average dorm
room.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)
                  (calls from the
                   shower)
          ... I keep telling myself okay,
          that's just the price, you have to
          do your time doing shitwork before
          you're allowed to get to the good
          stuff... but if I have to catalog
          one more quasar...
                  (sticks her head
                   out)
          God, I've missed you.

                         PETER
          Any luck on the grant money?

                         ELLIE
          Please.  Any chance of that died the
          day David Drumlin was appointed head
          of the N.S.F.  I have been in
          contact with a few other SETI
          people; we've been trying to find
          backing from private investors.
          I've even managed to scrounge a
          couple of hours of telescope time
          here and there...

                         PETER
          And?

                         ELLIE
          I've examined over forty stars of
          roughly solar spectral type but so
          far nothing.  Still, we've barely
          started...

Peter is silent.

EXT.  MT.  ARECIBO (PUERTO RICO) - DAY

Ellie and Peter walk along the periphery of the vast
concave dish.  A gentle breeze blows.

                         ELLIE
          ... We've been going after some of
          the big multi-nationals but without
          much luck; got a donation from a New
          York dowager... We've even been
          thinking about selling T-shirts.

                         PETER
          Ellie... even if you do manage to
          raise the money, have you thought
          about what it would really mean to
          follow through on this?  I mean a
          college fetish is one thing, but
          we're talking about your career.
          You won't be publishing.  You won't
          be taken seriously... and you could
          spend your entire life looking and
          never find anything at all.

Ellie pauses; looks out at the endless ocean of green.
Quietly:

                         ELLIE
          If we lived at any previous time in
          human history we wouldn't even have
          the option of failing -- we'd have
          to wonder our whole lives, unable to
          do anything about it.  This time,
          right now, is unique in our history,
          in any civilization's history -- the
          moment of the acquisition of
          technology.  The moment when contact
          becomes possible.  We've already
          beaten incredible odds by being
          lucky enough to be alive now.

                         PETER
                  (pausing)
          How close are you to getting this
          funding put together?

                         ELLIE
          It's almost there.  The hardest part
          is getting someone to sell us the
          telescope time.

                         PETER
          What if I said I could get Drumlin
          to agree to sell you time in New
          Mexico?

                         ELLIE
                  (stunned)
          The V.L.A.?

                         PETER
          Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could
          search more sky there in a day than
          you could in a year here.

                         ELLIE
          Peter -- if you can get him to do
          that for me he'd obviously do the
          same for you -- we could -- !

                         PETER
          Actually --

                         ELLIE
          We could be together again --

                         PETER
          -- I'm moving to Washington.

                         ELLIE
                  (confused)
          Greenbank?

                         PETER
          I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To
          work for Drumlin.

                         ELLIE
          But what about your research -- ?

                         PETER
          This is a chance to be of enormous
          help to other people's research --
          to have the power to be a real
          advocate where David's got blind
          spots --

                         ELLIE
          But the work --

                         PETER
          'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't
          there just once be more to life than
          the work?  Okay, maybe that's the
          only way to get the recognition, win
          the prizes --

                         ELLIE
          Please, you're just as ambitious as
          I am, more --

                         PETER
          Maybe that's the problem.  I want...
          a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A
          townhouse on L street instead of
          still living like a college kid.  A
          real life.  Maybe that makes me a
          sellout but I don't care anymore.
          It's what I want.

                         ELLIE
          And you think I don't want those
          things?  You think I don't stay up
          half the night wondering if I've
          made the right choice living half a
          world away from you, wondering if
          any of this is worth what I'm giving
          up for it everyday?
                  (as Peter is silent;
                   suddenly)
          Let's get married.

                         PETER
          Jesus --

                         ELLIE
          Right now -- we'll drive down to
          Ramey and get the base chaplain to
          marry us.

                         PETER
          Ellie --

                         ELLIE
          I'm serious about this, Peter --

                         PETER
          Ellie -- I'm getting married.
                  (off a stunned
                   silence)
          Her name's Laura.  She came up to
          Owens Valley to do her post-doc
          about six months after you left.

                         ELLIE
                  (stares)
          You sonofabitch.

                         PETER
          That is true.  But it's also true
          that if I really thought we wanted
          the same things, I'd follow you
          anywhere... but the truth is I don't
          think you want the company.
                  (softly)
          Be honest, El.  There's nowhere
          you'd rather be than sitting out at
          some remote corner of the world
          searching for the answers to the
          mysteries of the universe.  And call
          me crazy, but I just can't compete
          with that... I'm sorry.

There's nothing left to say.  He rises, starts to make his
way down.  OFF Ellie, stunned --

DEEP SPACE - MESSAGE

The yellow star is now definitely brighter than the rest.

EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

A 1967 T-Bird travels swiftly along a dirt road through
the moonlit desert.  The VIEW CLIMBS, WIDENS to include a
huge radio telescope, and as we come around we see an even
more stunning sight:  30 more of them.

SUPERIMPOSE:  SAPPORO, NEW MEXICO - 1993

EXT.  VLA MAIN BUILDING - NIGHT

The T-Bird pulls up in front of a bland, institutional
building.  Ellie climbs out, stretches, then pulls a
single small suitcase from the back seat.

INT.  CAFETERIA/LOUNGE - NIGHT

Over an ancient Mr. Coffee machine some hysteric has
scribbled:  "Someone has been drinking the coffee without
leaving the .10c in the cup and WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE."
Ellie drops her dime in.  As she pours she hears a strange
sound:  a steady repetitive SSSHHH... SSSHHH... She
follows the noise down the hall.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off; the large room is illuminated solely
by the night sky and glowing banks of electronic
equipment.  Through the large panorama window we can see
the silhouettes of the enormous radio telescopes in the
moonlight.  We make out a shape sitting in the darkness
listening to the sounds, louder now:  SSSHHH... SSSHHH...
And then a voice calls out:

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          Light's behind you, to the left.

Ellie finds the switch, flips on the lights, revealing
KENT CULLERS, 30's, wearing Raybans.

                         ELLIE
          Dr. Cullers?

                         KENT
          Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must
          be Eleanor.

                         ELLIE
                  (moving to the
                   control panel)
          Ellie.  Pulsar?

                         KENT
          1919+21.  Found a glitch in the
          timing; probably a starquake.

                         ELLIE
          Nice.  Where?

Kent types in a few commands and the computer screen
lights up.  It reads "Radio Sky" and it looks nothing like
the ordinary optical sky; more like an elaborate oriental
rug.  Pointing:

                         KENT
          Here, right around Centaurus A.

                         ELLIE
          This is how you see the sky?

                         KENT
          It's how I hear it.  The display's
          just a little something I programmed
          for astronomers with the misfortune
          of sight.

                         ELLIE
          It's beautiful.

                         KENT
          Never seen the optical sky myself,
          but I hear it's nice too.

                         MILLINGTON (O.S.)
          Yo, Ray Charles, time's up.  Oh --
          sorry --

                         KENT
          Doctors Millington, Curtain, Dr.
          Arroway.

Ellie raises a hand in greeting to the two men in the
doorway, they wave awkwardly back.

                         KENT
          Rick's doing black holes at the
          center of galaxies; Tom's studying
          globular clusters in the e-band.
                  (to the guys)
          And Dr. Arroway here will be
          spending her precious time listening
          for little green men.  All yours,
          guys.

As he rises MILLINGTON and CURTAIN move to take his place
at the controls.  They maneuver shyly around Ellie.

                         ELLIE
          Um... should I...

                         MILLINGTON/CURTAIN
                  (way too fast)
          No, no, no -- have a seat.

Kent smiles, exits.  Ellie sits, looks over the control
console, rubs her hands...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  VLA CONTROL ROOM - DAY

In the daylight we see the sad truth of the place:  a
character-free cinderblock box filled with a mishmash of
equipment, aging and jerry-rigged alongside the spoils
of the odd successful grant application.  Through a wall
of windows we can see the cafeteria/lounge area; an
ancient Ping-Pong table.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)
          Hey, Fish, has that pointing error
          in twenty-nine been fixed yet?

                         FISHER
          It's a worm gear; still a little
          sluggish but it'll have to do.

Ellie again sits at the main console, but time has clearly
dissipated some of her initial enthusiasm.  She frowns as
she peers at the telescope THROUGH the windows...

                         ELLIE
          J39 Z186...?

                         WILLIE
          Been there, done that, got the
          T-shirt.

                         ELLIE
          VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis...
          too old.

                         KENT
                  (at the coffee
                   machine)
          You've only searched -- what is it,
          sixteen hundred stars without a
          peep?  Try not to take it too
          personally.

                         ELLIE
          Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.
                  (frowns)
          I'm coming at this wrong... missing
          something... something...

DUSTY PAIR OF SNEAKERS

trek through the moonlit scrub desert, trailing cable
behind them...

EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT

Ellie sits cross-legged on the hard earth, hunched over
with her fingers barely touching the pair of headphones
she wears.  We hear the faint arhythmic pulsing of
STATIC... Ellie's eyes are closed; she leans forward, an
expression of peculiar intensity on her face...

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  DESERT - WIDE

Ellie's tiny hunched-over figure is sitting about a
thousand yards away from the main building, rocking slowly
back and forth under the vast desert sky, back and
forth,listening...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

A government sedan travels the dusty road to the VLA.

EXT.  VLA MAIN BUILDING - LATER AFTERNOON

The sedan pulls up.  WILLIE climbs out of the driver's
side and comes around to get the bags as David Drumlin
emerges, formidable and patrician as ever.  Kent, Fisher,
Millington, Curtain and a number of other scientists are
there to greet him.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (hand at his back)
          Now I remember why I went into
          theoretical work.  Kent.

                         KENT
          Glad to have you, David.  How's the
          new office?

                         DRUMLIN
          Still settling in, really.
                  (looking over the
                   group)
          Where's Dr. Arroway?

INT.  VLA CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Kent and Fisher lead Drumlin through the complex; his
conservative suit out of place among the jeans and
T-shirts; other scientists either smile obsequiously or
avert their gaze.

                         FISHER
          ... not that there's a whole lot in
          the way of entertainment around here
          but I guess it beats communing with
          washing machines.

                         DRUMLIN
          What's that?

                         KENT
          Nothing.
                  (looking at Fisher;
                   hesitates a long
                   beat)
          Okay.  Some of us have been a
          little... not concerned, exactly,
          but...

                         DRUMLIN
                  (almost gently)
          Tell me.

                         KENT
                  (hesitates again;
                   finally)
          Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr.
          Fisher -- was on a late shift, and
          he found her doing laundry.

                         DRUMLIN
          So?

                         KENT
          So... there wasn't any clothes in
          the machine.  She was just sitting
          there on the floor with her ear
          pressed up against the Maytag.
          Listening.

EXT.  VLA LIVING QUARTERS - ESTABLISHING - DUSK

Across a barren patch of desert lies a weathered
residential outbuilding, something between a dormitory and
a Motel Six.

INT.  ELLIE'S QUARTERS - DUSK

Home.  Painted cinderblock, a single star map up on the
wall.  An old lumpy couch, several monitors along a shelf
on one wall that connects her to the control room.
Headphones, listening equipment.  Ellie is at the fridge.

                         ELLIE
          Pepsi?  Tequila?

                         DRUMLIN
          No, thanks.

He sits on the corner of the unmade bed.  Ellie pops open
a soda, unselfconscious.

                         DRUMLIN
          Peter sends his regards.

                         ELLIE
                  (a little too
                   nonchalant)
          Oh?  How's he doing?

                         DRUMLIN
          Very well; since my appointment he's
          been made interim director.

                         ELLIE
          Really?  Congratulations, by the
          way.

                         DRUMLIN
          I'm surprised you even knew it was
          an election year.

                         ELLIE
          'President's Science Advisor' -- so
          what, you just spend all your time
          jetting around on Air Force One
          now...?

                         DRUMLIN
          Now exactly.  It's... complicated.

                         ELLIE
          No doubt.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (a beat, then)
          Ellie...

                         ELLIE
                  (avoiding the
                   inevitable)
          Did I tell you we've expanded the
          search spectrum?  We're including
          several other possible magic
          frequencies -- not just the hydrogen
          line anymore.  I was trying to get
          inside their heads, y'know?  And I
          started thinking, what other
          constants are there in the Universe
          besides hydrogen, and then suddenly
          it was so obvious -- transcendantals,
          right?  So we've been trying
          variations of pi...

                         DRUMLIN
          You know why I'm here.

                         ELLIE
          It's not enough having my search
          time systematically cut down -- you
          know I'm down to three hours a week
          now.

                         DRUMLIN
          Ellie, I should have done this a
          long time ago, certainly before I
          left the N.S.F., but I wanted to
          give you every benefit of the
          doubt --

                         ELLIE
          You can't just pull the plug, David.

                         DRUMLIN
          It's not like you've given me much
          choice.

                         ELLIE
          Meaning...

                         DRUMLIN
          Meaning I have to go defend a budget
          to the President and to Congress and
          you're out here listening to washing
          machines.

                         ELLIE
                  (quietly)
          I'm searching for patterns in the
          noise, that's all.  Order in the
          chaos.  I'm practicing listening --

                         DRUMLIN
          The point is, this isn't just
          scientific inquiry anymore -- it's
          turned into some kind of personal
          obsession.

                         ELLIE
          The difference being what -- that I
          refuse to adopt the standard line,
          that I don't care about the results
          of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of
          course any discovery has to be
          verifiable, of course it must be
          subject to all rigors of scientific
          method, but I refuse to go around
          pretending I'm some kind of
          dispassionate automaton when it's
          obvious to anyone with a brain I'm
          just not.

                         DRUMLIN
          No... You're not.  But the price has
          just gotten too high.

                         ELLIE
          Goddamnit, they are out there,
          David --

                         DRUMLIN
          Then why haven't you detected any
          signals?  If, as you claim, there
          have been thousands, millions of
          advanced civilizations out there for
          millions of years then why hasn't
          one signal gotten through?
                  (rising)
          It'll take a month or two for the
          paperwork to go through; you're
          welcome to stay until then.

                         ELLIE
          David --

                         DRUMLIN
          It was a worthy experiment -- worthy
          of you; I was wrong about that part.
          But it's over now.

He leaves.  Ellie just stands there in the window,
fighting back the emotion, watching the telescopes in the
falling light...

                  (TV)
          My guest tonight is author and
          theologian Palmer Joss, 'God's
          diplomat' according to the New York
          Times.  His new book -- Losing Faith
          -- is currently number one on that
          publication's bestseller list.
          Thanks for being with us, Reverend.
          Okay -- who's losing faith -- and
          why?

Our first glimpse of Palmer Joss.  He has a rumpled,
rugged charm that has become just the slightest bit
polished.  No bullshit, agreeably ironic, he's ridden the
wave of the New Spiritualism farther than even he ever
imagined.

                         JOSS (V.O.)
          Well, let me start this way, Larry.
          What has science done for you
          lately?

                         LARRY KING (V.O.)
          Besides letting me broadcast this
          program all over the world?

                         JOSS (V.O.)
                  (smiles)
          Besides that.  Or better, I'll give
          you that, but tell me this:  Are
          you happier?  Are we happier?  Is
          our would fundamentally a better
          place?

WIDEN SLOWLY to reveal:

INT.  VLA CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Willie and Fisher sit at the command console, battling the
ennui of their watch.  BOB MARLEY plays on a battered
BOOMBOX; Fisher watches Joss on a Watchman.

                         JOSS (V.O.)
                  (TV)
          Don't get me wrong -- we're smart,
          Larry.  We shop at home, we surf the
          net... and we feel emptier and
          lonelier and more cut off from each
          other than at any other time in
          human history...

Fisher eats a Baby Ruth and sips a Coke as he watches.
Willie, heavy into his Gameboy, has a sudden epiphany.

                         WILLIE
          Y'know who'd make great astronomers?
          Vampires.  Think about it; the
          perfect synthesis of career and
          lifestyle.

                         FISHER
                  (engrossed in TV)
          Shut up, Willie.

INT.  ELLIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ellie lies crashed out on the couch, headphones on.  All
we hear is STATIC...

... and then, beneath the static, we begin to hear another
sound, barely audible but definitely there...

A faint irregular PULSING, FADING IN AND OUT of reception.

Ellie slowly swims up to consciousness.  After a moment
her eyes open.  She sits up --

TIGHT ON BOOMBOX

still playing REGGAE.  A hand reaches in and turns it OFF.

INT.  VLA CONTROL - ROOM

Willie and Fisher look up in surprise as Ellie goes to the
main console, starts checking instrument readings.

                         WILLIE
          Got a bogey, boss?

                         ELLIE
          I'm not sure.  You mind checking
          right ascension 18 hours, 34
          minutes; declination plus 38 degrees
          41 minutes?

                         FISHER
          What's the frequency?

                         ELLIE
          4458.8 gigahertz.

Fisher and Willie look at each other significantly.

                         ELLIE
          It's probably nothing.

They start typing in coordinates.

Willie puts on headsets, flips a switch, twists a dial.

                         ELLIE
          Put it on speakers.

He punches a button.  An eerie, PULSING METALLIC SOUND.
Willie and Fisher run their routine checks with a
practiced calm --

Around the room a few night owls are watching with growing
interest.  Ellie types rapidly on a keyboard, watching a
monitor above her:  SEARCH)STAR FIELD ORIGIN OF SIGNAL)

                         FISHER
          Checking interferometric position.
          Somewhere in Lyra, I think...

                         ELLIE
          Vega...?

                         WILLIE
          That can't be right; it's only
          twenty-six light years away.

                         ELLIE
          I scanned it at Arecibo; negative
          results, always.

                         FISHER
          Linearly polarized; a set of moving
          pulses restricted to two different
          amplitudes --

                         WILLIE
          Air Force isn't supposed to be on
          this frequency.

                         ELLIE
          That's what they always say; punch
          up the darks.

Another display shows all satellites and major debris in
orbit; "darks" glow in red.

                         ELLIE
                  (murmurs)
          How's the spying tonight, guys?

                         WILLIE
          NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft
          in our vector including snoops;
          shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.

                         FISHER
          Interferometry now rules out a
          Molniya-type orbit.

                         WILLIE
          Confirming sidereal motion; whatever
          it is, it ain't local.

Ellie fights to stay calm -- but the excitement rippling
through the gathered is palpable --

                         ELLIE
          Display absolute intensity.

On another monitor a sound spike leaps with each pulse.

                         WILLIE
          Reading over a hundred janskys --

Ellie puts on headsets, shuts her eyes in fierce
concentration as she listens -- for a moment only a signal
echoes through the control room --

                         ELLIE
          Numbers.  Those are numbers, each
          pulse is a set -- break it down --

Now with each pulse, long strings of zeros and ones
appear.  On the monitor:  PROMPT:  CONVERTING TO BASE 10)

With each pulse a number appears:  59  61  67  71  79  83

          79 -- 83 -- 91 -- they're all
          primes, no way that's a natural
          phenomenon -- !

The room ignites.  Ellie shouts over the din --

                         ELLIE
          Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up
          the starfield signal origin.

                         KENT (O.S.)
          It can't be coming from Vega, the
          system's too young.

Kent stands sleepily in the doorway, wearing Kermit the
Frog pajamas and an old robe.  Willie punches up a screen:

                         ELLIE
          Or if they're in polar orbit -- but
          no, you're right.  If we go public
          and we're wrong, that's it -- it is
          over for us.
                  (the room grows
                   quiet)
          Vega will set in a couple of hours;
          it's probably already risen in
          Australia.  Let's call Ian and see
          if we can get some verification on
          this.

Willie picks up the phone and dials.  All eyes on Ellie.

                         ELLIE
          Okay.  We have an intense, not very
          monochromatic signal, linearly
          polarized as if coming from an
          antenna, source moving with the
          stars so it can't be an airplane or
          spacecraft; on and only on a
          frequency whose only significance
          would be to an intelligence that
          wanted to be directed.  If anyone
          can come up with any plausible or
          even implausible explanation besides
          ETI I want to hear it, now.

Silence.  Willie on the phone --

                         WILLIE
          Yeah -- yeah, just a sec --

He looks up at Ellie.  She looks back --

          Thanks, Ian.  Can you just keep
          tracking it as long as you can and
          we'll get back to you.
                  (slowly puts down
                   the phone, then)
          Get this out to every observatory
          and radio array on the planet.
          Um... and get me the President's
          Science Advisor.

Outside the sun is coming up.  They all look to the
windows.  The telescopes are silhouetted against the pale
light.

Ellie goes.  They watch her -- then turn to look out at
the rows of mechanical flowers pointing up at the new
dawn.

INT.  ELLIE'S ROOM

Ellie shuts the door behind her.  She sinks to the
floor, looks up, breathless --

EXT.  VLA - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

Security guards stonewall two mobile TV news trucks.  A
handful of protesters picket the entrance carrying signs;
"JUSTICE," "STOP THE COVERUP," "ROSWELL."

                         KITZ
          The President will be making a

          have no comment.

INT.  CONTROL CENTER - DAY

Fisher leads Kitz, Drumlin and the rest of the delegation
around the room.  Coffee cups and cigarettes abound.
Drumlin crosses over to Willie's console, studies the
display.  In the b.g. we hear the constant BEEPING of the
MESSAGE.

                         DRUMLIN
          What's the latest?

                         WILLIE
          Forty-four stations worldwide now
          confirming the signal, sir.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (to an aide)
          Let's get some decryption people
          here, now.  Dr. Lunacharsky's
          visiting at the University of New
          Mexico --

Kitz and others look at the main display as the primes
continue to scroll.

                         KITZ
          I don't get it.  If this
          civilization is so advanced why the
          remedial math?

                         SENATE DELEGATE
          Why don't they just speak English?

                         ELLIE (O.S.)
          Maybe because seventy percent of the
          planet speaks other languages.

All eyes turn to Ellie; she hasn't slept but you'd hardly
notice.

                         ELLIE
          Mathematics is the only truly
          universal language, Senator.  We
          think this may be a beacon -- an
          announcement to get our attention.

                         DRUMLIN
          If it's attention you want I'd say
          you've got it.
                  (as Ellie turns to
                   him)
          Just one thing:  Why Vega?
          Everyone's looked at Vega for years
          with no results, and now, yesterday,
          they start broadcasting primes.
          Why?

                         ELLIE
          It's hardly yesterday; the signal's
          been traveling for over twenty-six
          years.  As for why...
                  (meeting his gaze)
          I'm hoping your own expertise in
          decryption algorithms will help us
          find out -- to see if there's
          another message buried deeper in the
          signal.

Drumlin frowns, effectively neutralized for the moment.

                         KITZ
          Dr. Arroway --

                         DRUMLIN
          Michael Kitz, National Security
          Advisor.

                         KITZ
          Dr. Arroway, let me first say --

                         ELLIE
          Before you do could you please ask
          the gentlemen with the firearms to
          wait outside?  This is a civilian
          facility.

Kitz pauses -- then gives a signal to dismiss the Berets.

                         ELLIE
          Oh, and if you could ask them not to
          use their radios -- interference.
          Thanks so much.

Drumlin warns her with a look, which she conveniently
avoids.

                         KITZ
          I'll come right to the point,
          Doctor.  Your sending this message
          all over the world may well be a
          breach of National Security.

                         ELLIE
          This isn't a person to person call,
          Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the
          civilization sending the message
          intended it just for Americans.

                         KITZ
          I'm saying you might have consulted
          us; the contents of this message
          could be extremely sensitive...

                         ELLIE
          You want to classify prime numbers?

                         DRUMLIN
          Mike, because of the Earth's
          rotation we're only in line with
          Vega so many hours a day; the only
          way to get the whole message is to
          cooperate with other stations.  If
          Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we
          could have lost key elements.

                         KITZ
          Okay, fine, they've got the primes
          -- but if you're right about there
          being another more significant
          transmission still to come --

                         ELLIE
          -- which we'll also need the
          network's help to receive and
          decode!

                         KITZ
          You don't seem to understand that
          it's your interests I'm trying to
          protect -- !

Suddenly the steady BEEPING of the MESSAGE STOPS, replaced
by terrible STATIC.  On the various displays the prime
numbers start to scramble.

                         FISHER
          Oh shit.

                         ELLIE
          Interference -- we're losing the
          signal.

                   slowly)
          It's a civilian facility.

Kitz allows himself the barest hint of a smile -- then
switches on his radio and speaks calmly into it.

                         KITZ
          Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty
          mile radio-silent perimeter put

Aides continue to hook up equipment as he talks on a red

          ... under control for the moment but
          the longer we wait the more unstable

          you should consider coming here...

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DUSK

STEPHEN LUNACHARSKY, a high-strung Russian scientist,
chain smokes as he types.  Ellie and Drumlin stand over
him, Kent next to him, others nearby.

                         ELLIE
          ... could it be a nested code of
          some sort?

                         DRUMLIN
          You must have checked the signal for
          polarization modulation already...

Ellie hesitates.  Drumlin looks at her.  Whoops.

                         ELLIE
          Dr. Lunacharsky...?

                         LUNACHARSKY

          Bingo.

Kitz, on the phone, sees the activity around the console.

Lunacharsky types in commands as he talks.

                         LUNACHARSKY
          A second layer, nested within the

          Product of three primes...

                         KITZ
                  (joining them)
          What.

                         LUNACHARSKY
          ... definitely three dimensions,
          either a hologram or a two-
          dimensional picture that moves in
          time; a movie.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (dryly)
          Hope there's a cartoon.

                         KITZ
          How is that possible?  How could all
          that information be encoded in --

                         KENT
          Well, sir, some bits of the signal
          are bits that tell us how to
          interpret the other bits.
          Technically speaking.

JURYRIGGED 35-INCH MONITOR

Strings of zeros and ones fill the screen as the group
assembles around it.

Willie types.  Ellie moves closer, studying it.
Intuitively:

                         ELLIE
          Try plotting values in a three
          dimensional coordinate system.

A pattern begins to emerge.

                         DRUMLIN
          Throw a gray scale on it; standard
          interpolation.

                         ELLIE
          Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.

Willie enters commands.  All are mesmerized by the shadows
taking form on the screen.

                         ELLIE
          It has to be an image.  Stack it up,
          string-breaks every 60th character.

On the screen a distinct black and white moving image
forms; grays define it even further.  The group is
transfixed.  Kitz whispers to an aide who makes a call in
a hand radio.

                         KENT
          Um... I've got an auxiliary sideband
          channel here.  I think it's audio.

An otherworldly RUMBLING GLISSANDO of sounds joins the
image, sliding up and down the spectrum... and then the
faint SWELLING MUSIC is heard.  Ellie reaches over Willie
and type more commands.  The picture rotates, rectifies,
focuses --

                         KITZ
          What in the hell...?

                         DRUMLIN
          It's a hoax.  I knew it!

                         KENT
          Um, excuse me, but would someone
          mind telling me what the hell is
          going on?

Other reactions range from astonishment to nervous
laughter.  Ellie and Peter stare in utter amazement.

ON SCREEN

A grainy black and white image of a massive reviewing
stand adorned with an immense Art Deco eagle.

Clutched in the eagle's concrete talons is a swastika.

Adolph Hitler salutes a rhythmically chanting crowd.

The deep baritone voice of an ANNOUNCER, scratchy but
unmistakably GERMAN, BOOMS through the room.  The dark
absurdity of the moment plays over Ellie's face; helpless:

                         ELLIE
          Anybody know German?

Kent tilts his head, closes his eyes.

                         KENT
          The Fuhrer... welcomes the world to
          the German Fatherland... for the

Hitler's face fills the screen.  The crowd roars its
approval.

          fealty...

Slowly WIDEN to reveal a monitor wall.

A kaleidoscopic display of global news coverage of the
event.  Demonstrations in a dozen cities, commentary from
pundits, Aryan leaders and Auschwitz survivors.  A single
figure sits before the monitors, taking in the cacophony.

INT.  VLA CORRIDOR - DAY

A huddle of figures sweeps down a dark corridor, charged
with power and purpose.

                         FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Forty million people die defeating
          that sonofabitch and he becomes our
          first ambassador to another
          civilization?  It makes me sick.

                         DRUMLIN (O.S.)
          With all due respect, the Hitler
          broadcast from the '36 Olympics was
          the first television transmission of
          any power that went into space.
          That they recorded it and sent it
          back is simply a way of saying
          'Hello, we heard you --'

                         KITZ (O.S.)
          -- Or 'you're our kind of people --'

                         DRUMLIN (O.S.)
          -- It's extremely unlikely that they
          had any idea what they were looking
          at.

                         FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          I can't believe that everything on
          TV is automatically broadcast all
          over the universe.  'Hard Copy'...
          Rickie Lake'...
                  (paling)
          Oh God, the '60 Minutes' interview.

The huddle bursts through a door and out into the dazzling
New Mexico morning, revealing the PRESIDENT and her
entourage:  Drumlin, Kitz, Secret Service, and fighting to
keep up, Ellie.

A sea of press awaits them as they move toward the podium,
which has been set up with the 31 enormous radio antennas
in the b.g.  As the CHIEF OF STAFF takes the podium Ellie
looks over her note cards, then nervously out at the
crowd.

                         CHIEF OF STAFF
          Ladies and gentlemen, the President
          of the United States.

President Helen Lasker addresses the crowd.  She's an
American version of Margaret Thatcher.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (FEMALE VOICE)
          My fellow Americans, citizens of the
          world, ladies and gentlemen of the
          press.  At 7:09 A.M. Eastern
          Standard Time yesterday morning,
          American scientists detected a radio
          signal from space.  This message was
          largely mathematical, and in spite
          of some of the headlines I've seen
          today, so far seems to be completely
          benign in nature.  To better explain
          the extraordinary events of the last
          24 hours, I'm turning you over to...
          Doctor David Drumlin.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  Drumlin doesn't miss a beat
as he strides to the podium.

                         DRUMLIN
          Good morning.  In 1936 a very faint
          television signal transmitted the
          opening ceremonies of the Olympic
          games as a show of German superior
          technology.  That signal left Earth
          at the speed of light and twenty-six
          years later arrived on Vega, which
          they then sent back to us hugely
          amplified.  As evidence of
          intelligence this is indisputable --

As Drumlin continues we see Fisher ease onto the dais from
behind, approach Ellie and surreptitiously hand her a
note.

                         DRUMLIN
          Whoever or whatever they are,
          they're clearly move advanced than
          we...

Ellie reads it, looks up at Fisher in surprise -- then
quietly slips away.  A murmur among the press as they
notice; the President and then Drumlin as well --

                         DRUMLIN
          ... maybe only decades or centuries,
          maybe much further along than
          that...

INT.  VLA CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Ellie hurries into the control room -- then stops dead.

POV - MAIN MONITOR

The incredibly complex geometric pattern we see flashing
on the screen will be referred to as hieroglyphics -- but
they are like no hieroglyphics ever seen before;
chillingly otherworldly, they are the first visual
artifact of an alien civilization.  The scientists stand
stunned and silent.

BACK TO SCENE

                         ELLIE
          What...

                         LUNACHARSKY
                  (softly)
          In ancient times when parchment was
          in short supply people would write
          over old writing... it was called a
          palimpsest.

                         ELLIE
          A third layer.

A phalanx of officials led by Drumlin, Kitz and the
President hurry in... and also stop at the sight of the
hieroglyphs.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          Oh my God...

                         KITZ
          What is it?

                         ELLIE
          I think we just hit the cosmic
          jackpot.

                         KENT
          It's incredibly rich.  We've been
          cataloging it in frames or 'pages';
          right now we're on 10,413.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          What does it say?

                         ELLIE
          It could be anything.  The first
          volume of some Encyclopedia
          Galactica...

                         KITZ
          ... instructions to acquaint us with
          their colonization procedures.

                         KENT
          Moses with a few billion new
          commandments...

                         KITZ
          Ms. President, in the interest of
          national security, I strongly
          recommend we militarize this project
          immediately --

                         ELLIE
          Pardon me, but you can't do -- !

                         KITZ
          If at some later date the message
          proves harmless, we can discuss
          sharing it with the rest of the
          world, but until then --

                         ELLIE
          That's terrific, but there's one
          problem:  we don't have the means to
          receive all the data on our own.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          Is that true?

                         DRUMLIN
          The only way would be if we had a
          radio telescope in orbit.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          We don't?  Why don't we?

                         ELLIE
          Because you cut it from the budget
          three years running.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          How soon will you be able to decode
          it?

                         LUNACHARSKY
          There's no way of knowing.  Without
          a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe
          never.

                         ELLIE
          Maybe it'll be at the end of the
          data when the message recycles.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          Well.  That would seem to decide it.
          Like it or not, for the moment,
          anyway, it looks like we're all in
          this together.

                         KITZ
          But --

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          That's it, Mike.  Last time I
          checked, I was still running the
          country.  Although it seems that for
          the moment, Dr. Arroway is running
          the planet.

The President looks up at the screen and involuntarily
shivers.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          Let's get out of here.

                                              CUT TO:

MONITOR WALL (LOCATION UNKNOWN) - DAY

More global news coverage, private surveillance camera
feeds; also some disturbing pornographic images.

On one monitor, a moment from the President's VLA press
conference plays over and over -- the moment when Drumlin
stepped up to the podium in front of Ellie.  A gnarled
hand pushes a button on a console and the image enlarges
-- we see Ellie's expression of shock and hurt, over and
over.  Over and over.

On the next monitor over is live CNN coverage of the scene
outside the VLA -- we begin to PUSH IN ON it --

                         WOLF BLITZER (V.O.)
          ... There had been speculation on
          the part of psychologists that the
          proliferation of depictions of
          aliens in movies and on television
          in recent years might make for an
          almost blase acceptance of the news.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

EXT.  DESERT (NEW MEXICO) - DAY

The road leading to the VLA is jammed with vehicles, RVs,
vans, busses, as far as the eye can see.  More people walk
on the side of the road.

                         WOLF BLITZER (V.O.)
          But the truth is, it turns out, is
          far stranger than anything Hollywood
          might have dreamed up -- and here,
          today, the prospect of
          extraterrestrial intelligence if no
          longer science fiction -- it's the
          best show in town.

The VIEW CLIMBS, REVEALING campfires, BBQs, tents of all
shapes and sizes littering the plains surrounding the
telescope array.  Signs and banners reading "Watch the
Skies" and "There are Aliens Among Us."  Woodstock 1998.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          ... I know you're angry -- we're all
          angry.  About the lies.  The
          corruption.  About the cancer of
          despair spreading through every
          aspect of our lives.  But Rome will
          fall, my friends; everywhere now are
          the signs of closure.  Even now the
          end begins.

EXT.  VLA ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Various preachers and new age gurus speak to gatherings
all along the new cyclone fence surrounding the VLA.  We
become aware of a crowd concentrated around a young man
speaking on a small stage:  JOSEPH.  He has the appeal of
a rock star, albeit a compelling well-spoken one.  His
AMPLIFIED VOICE RINGS OUT:

                         JOSEPH
          The millennium is upon us.  God has
          fulfilled his promise, sending us
          this herald to warn the faithless --
          the scientists who tell us He
          doesn't even exist -- and to promise
          us, the faithful, we will be saved.

Beyond Joseph we can see through the shiny new cyclone
fence to the VLA building, now surrounded by tents and
temporary structures.

                         JOSEPH (O.S.)
          I don't know what this voice from
          the sky says -- but I do know that
          if history has taught us anything,
          it's that the politicians and the
          scientists are lying to us, right
          now, for their own good!  Are these
          the kind of people you want talking
          to your God for you -- ?

INT.  VLA CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Outside, the panorama window searchlights fan, CROWDS
CHANT frightening rhythms.  Inside, the numbing, never-
ending pulses of the signal and scrolling numbers.

The former lounge/cafeteria has been turned into
decryption central:  dozens of personal workstations,
populated with Silicon Valley's finest assortment of
techno-wizards, crashed out on cots in a 'round-the-clock
effort to break the code.

Ellie sips her coffee as she walks briskly through the
chaos; Drumlin matches her stride for stride.

                         DRUMLIN
          ... Arrangements also have to be
          made for the V.I.P.s coming in,
          mostly religious leaders...

                         ELLIE
          What?  Why?

                         DRUMLIN
          The theological ramifications of all
          this are obvious; the President
          feels we need to include religious
          interests rather than alienate them.
          She's also named Palmer Joss as
          their liaison; he's requested a
          meeting with you.

                         ELLIE
          With me.

                         DRUMLIN
          Apparently he's genuinely interested
          in science.  This could be a chance
          to win him over.

                         ELLIE
          I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is-
          the-root-of-all-evil?  This is
          absurd, David.  We have work to do
          here, I don't have time to play
          babysitter to the God Squad.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (low and dangerous)
          Ellie --

Ellie looks at him in surprise as he grabs her by the
elbow.

                         DRUMLIN
          I want you to listen to me,
          carefully.  The minute the
          implications of this message became
          clear, this stopped being simply a
          scientific matter and became a
          political one -- an extremely
          complex, extremely volatile one.
          There are forces at work here you
          don't understand; I can help you up
          to a point, but only up to a point.

                         ELLIE
                  (in innocent wonder)
          Are you threatening me?

                         DRUMLIN
          It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a
          fact -- if you're not careful, you
          may find yourself out in the cold
          very quickly.  Play ball.  Really.
          It's good advice.

Ellie stops as she notices through the windows,
Lunacharsky stepping out of the decryption area.  He's
looking right at her.

                         ELLIE
          Excuse me.

ANGLE

As Ellie approaches Lunacharsky, something in his eyes
tells her there's more to his weary look than just
fatigue.

                         ELLIE
          What?

                         LUNACHARSKY
          We've repeated.  A few minutes ago
          the message cycled back to page one.

                         ELLIE
          And?

                         LUNACHARSKY
          No primer.

                         ELLIE
                  (incredulous)
          How can that be?

                         LUNACHARSKY
          I don't know.  Maybe there is a
          fourth layer in there somewhere, but
          if there is, I sure as hell can't
          find it.

Ellie stares at him -- turns to look at Drumlin -- then
walks out of the room.

INT.  ELLIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Bleary-eyed, three days with no sleep, Ellie sits at her
terminal, staring at the hieroglyphics, more impenetrable
then ever.  In the corner, the TV DRONES.

                         BERNIE SHAW (V.O.)
          ... And with church attendance at
          record highs, a coalition of
          religious leaders are using their
          increased political capital to
          challenge the very legality of radio
          astronomy itself, claiming the
          message and its contents subvert the
          moral climate of their
          constituencies.  More after this...

A CNN special report logo -- "The Message," dazzlingly
vulgar with its own graphics and there.

A COMMERCIAL CONTINUES in the b.g.:

                         COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          In the air, under the sea, in the
          depths of D.N.A. itself, Hadden
          Industries is at the frontier...

Ellie, chin on forearms, stares at her screen, willing
herself to find a pattern.

Suddenly she blinks -- something is changing.  A dot
appears in the middle of the screen.  It begins to grow,
revealing a complex fractal shape.  It splits, enlarges,
splits again, the shapes finally revealing themselves
as... English letters.  Which read:

"TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER"

Ellie stares --

                         ELLIE
          Someone's broken into the system,
          someone's compromised the
          fucking -- !

She quickly type in:  "Who are you?"

The fractals reform"  "I'VE GOT A SECRET."

Ellie types again:  "WHO ARE YOU?"

The fractals reform:  "YOUR PLACE OR MINE?"

Ellie stares -- more fractals form as she grabs a pen and
paper --

EXT.  VLA - NIGHT

National Guardsmen have established a perimeter around the
compound; soldiers are posted on the main road as well.
As Ellie ROARS through the gate in her 1967 T-BIRD, our
VIEW RISES:  the new Woodstock nation is, for the moment,
asleep.

EXT.  HIGHWAY (NEW MEXICO) - NIGHT

Ellie's tense face lit by the dash.  She picks up a piece
of paper with scribbled directions on it.  Turns onto a
dirt road.

EXT.  HIGHWAY (NEW MEXICO) - LOW ANGLE POV - NIGHT

of Ellie's CAR ROARING by SWINGS to reveal a jackrabbit
sitting at the side of the road, its nose twitching.

EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT

Ellie's car approaches a small, private airstrip; a black,
unmarked helicopter is waiting.

HIGH ABOVE UTAH - DAWN

The strange rock formations of southeastern Utah almost
resemble another planet.

EXT.  LARGER AIRSTRIP (UTAH)

As the helicopter sets down, we see two Lear jets and
another Helicopter... service vehicles for the enormous
Russian transport plane that sits beyond them.

A dark-suited Japanese MAJOR DOMO helps Ellie out of the
helicopter.

                         MAJOR DOMO
          You should be flattered.  He hardly
          lands for anyone.

INT.  TRANSPORT PLANE

The Major Domo leads Ellie down a corridor of the plane's
custom interior.  Through one door we can see into a room
where several very beautiful, very young women sit
watching TV with vacant eyes.  Ellie only catches a
glimpse before the Major Domo nods for her to enter the
main room and takes his post outside.

Ellie cautiously enters the interior of what appears to be
a flying Dascha; dark, heavy on the chintz.  Bookshelves,
an exercise machine... and a wall of monitors, filled top
to bottom with scrolling hieroglyphics.  Ellie reaches out
to them --

                         HADDEN (O.S.)
          Dr. Arroway, I presume.

Ellie turns to see S.R. HADDEN.  Thick glasses, wearing a
cardigan, he stands by a silver samovar.

                         ELLIE
          S.R. Hadden...
                  (beat)
          You compromised our security codes.

                         HADDEN
          Once upon a time I was a hell of an
          engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I
          have guests so rarely, it's
          important to me they feel welcome in
          my home.
                  (turns to the
                   samovar)
          Did you know this was once Yeltsin's
          flying dascha?  That dent is where
          he threw a bottle of vodka at the
          pilot.  At least that's what the
          people who sold me the plane said...

As he speaks, he slowly and with great effort raises a
glass to the samovar, fills it with tea.

                         ELLIE
          You live here.

                         HADDEN
          I find it convenient to keep my
          interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've
          had my fill of life on the ground.
          After spending much of this century
          pursuing the evils and pleasures the
          world has to offer -- after
          outliving three wives and two
          children...
                  (a bare flicker of
                   emotion)
          I find I've had quite enough of
          planet Earth.

                         ELLIE
          Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?

                         HADDEN
                  (smiles)
          The infamous, unfashionable
          bluntness.
                  (turning)
          You're here so we can do business.
          I want to make a deal.

                         ELLIE
          What kind of deal?

                         HADDEN
          The powers that be have been quite
          busy lately, falling over each other
          to position themselves for the game
          of the century, if not the
          millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.
                  (as Ellie reacts,
                   Hadden smiles)
          Perhaps I could help deal you back
          in.

                         ELLIE
          I didn't realize I was out.

                         HADDEN
          Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely
          looking for you coat.
                  (beat)
          I understand you've had some
          difficulty locating the -- what are
          you calling it?  The 'primer' that
          will make decryption possible...
                  (he turns to her,
                   simply)
          I've found it.

                         ELLIE
          You've... found it.
                  (catching her breath)
          What could I possibly have that you
          would want, Mr. Hadden?

                         HADDEN
          I've had a long time to make
          enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are
          many governments, business
          interests, even religious leaders
          who would like to see me disappear.
          And I will grant them their wish
          soon enough... But before I do, I
          wish to make a small contribution --
          a final gesture of goodwill toward
          the people of this little planet
          who've given -- from whom I've taken
          so much.

                         ELLIE
          If I knew you any better I'd say
          that doesn't sound like you.

                         HADDEN
                  (a dazzling smile)
          That's my girl...
                  (then)
          Lights.

The lights dim.  The wall monitors take center stage.

                         HADDEN
          Forgive the theatrics, it's a
          weakness.

Hadden pulls on a pair of gloves for an imaginary VR
keyboard.  He gestures for Ellie to sit beside him, facing
the monitors.  He begins to type as the monitors scroll
hieroglyphics --

                         HADDEN
          Page after page of data -- over
          sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm
          not mistaken... and at the end of
          each...

                         ELLIE
          A page-break signal.  A period.

                         HADDEN
          Not if you think like a Vegan.

                         ELLIE
          You're saying... there is no
          separate primer in the message --
          because it's on every page so the
          recipient can decipher it wherever
          he is --

                         HADDEN
          -- even if he doesn't receive the
          entire transmission.  Heaven is the
          mustard seed.

Hadden ghost-types a series of commands.  The monitor wall
syncs into a giant vidscreen --

The hieroglyphics begin to enlarge.  An almost invisible
dot in the lower right corner of the screen -- the page-
break signal -- grows larger and larger, until it reveals
a level of complexity and detail greater than that of the
hieroglyphics themselves.

                         ELLIE
                  (breathless)
          Holy shit...

These new symbols begin to mutate change... something is
happening, Hadden leans in to Ellie.

                         HADDEN
          You'll like this part.  A little
          flashy...

ON SCREEN

The symbols metamorphose into strange, fractal shapes;
like crystals, they begin to grow and shift, interacting
in a stunningly beautiful and intricate ballet --

                         ELLIE
          Some kind of circuitry...?

                         HADDEN
          Very good, Doctor.  I've also
          detected structural elements, back
          references, a general movement from
          the simple to the complex -- all of
          which would seem to indicate
          instructions -- an enormously
          complicated set of instructions --
          for building something.

                         ELLIE
          A machine.
                  (off Hadden's nod)
          But a machine that does what?

                         HADDEN
                  (smiles)
          That would seem to be the question
          of the hour.
                  (turning to her)
          I want to build it, Doctor.  Of
          course I'm already lobbying through
          the usual channels of influence and
          corruption -- but as I said, my
          colorful past has made many of those
          channels... difficult to navigate.
          I need someone on the inside.

                         ELLIE
          And in return?

                         HADDEN
          In return... you get the primer --
          and with it the power to stay in the
          game.  Do we have a deal?

Ellie pulls herself away from the hypnotic display.

                         ELLIE
          Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't
          make deals... But.  If you wish to
          give me, in good faith, access to
          your information, I can assure you
          that I will exert all reasonable
          efforts to promote your cause
          wherever it doesn't conflict with
          the best interests of science... or
          my better judgment.

                         HADDEN
                  (delighted)
          That's my girl.  Done.

Ellie turns to watch the screens as the fractals continue
to coalesce.  Dazzled --

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  CAMP DAVID - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

The snow-covered Presidential retreat in its forest
setting.

INT.  CAMP DAVID - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Charts display a decoded periodic table, the slice of
circuitry; monitors scroll through hundreds of decoded
pages.

                         ELLIE
          ... And while its function remains,
          for the moment, a mystery, my best
          guess is that it represents a
          transport of some kind.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          A transport.  So are they coming or
          are we going?

                         KITZ
                  (interrupting)
          The transport theory is only one
          hypothesis, Ms. President, and in my
          view a rather naive one.  It could
          just as easily be some kind of
          Trojan Horse.  We build it and out
          pours the entire Vegan army.

                         CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS
          Why even bother to risk personnel?
          Why not send some kind of doomsday
          machine?  Every time an emerging
          technological civilization announces
          itself by broadcasting radio waves
          into space they reply with a
          message.  The civilization builds it
          and blows itself up.  No
          expeditionary force needed.

                         ELLIE
          Ms. President, this is communist
          paranoia right out of War of the
          Worlds.  There is no reason
          whatsoever to believe the ETIs
          intentions are hostile.  We pose no
          threat to them -- it would be like
          us going out of our way to destroy
          microbes on a beach in Africa.

                         DRUMLIN
          Interesting analogy.  And how guilty
          would we feel if we happened to
          destroy some microbes on a beach in
          Africa?

                         KITZ
                  (turning to Ellie)
          I hope you're right, Doctor.  But
          right now my job is to protect
          American lives from any plausible
          threat, and in that regard I have to
          assume the worst.

                         RICHARD RANK
          From a non-secular perspective, I'm
          forced to agree.

All heads turn to RICHARD RANK, a surprisingly young and
well-spoken spokesman for the religious right.

                         RANK
          My coalition's phone lines have been
          flooded with calls from concerned
          families, wondering if this message
          signifies the end of the world or
          the advent of the rapture.
                  (smiles)
          We feel that U.S. policy in this
          matter wants to be extremely
          conservative -- if there's any
          chance of danger or threat to our
          way of life perhaps the message and
          its contents should simply be
          disregarded.

                         ELLIE
          This is absurd.

Drumlin shoots her a warning look; Rank ignores her.

                         RANK
          The Bible states that God made man
          in His own image.  From everything
          I've been told it's highly unlikely
          the creatures who sent this message
          resemble human beings in any way,
          shape or form, ergo, they are not of
          God; and therefore by definition
          evil.  My constituents simply want
          to know what their government plans
          to do to protect them --

                         ELLIE
          Ms. President, forgive me but I
          thought this was to be a serious
          discussion of policy and technical
          issues, not a war council against
          Satan's minions --

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          Mr. Rank's organization represents
          the point of view of tens of
          millions of families, Dr. Arroway.
          Feel free to disagree, but there
          won't be any suppressing of opinions
          here today.

                         ELLIE
          Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying
          is, this message was written in the
          language of science -- mathematics
          -- and was clearly intended to be
          received by scientists.  If it had
          been religious in nature it should
          have taken the form of a burning
          bush, or a booming voice from the
          sky...

                         JOSS (O.S.)
          But a voice from the sky is just
          what you say you've found.

Palmer Joss sits forward in his chair.

                         JOSS
          I agree with Mr. Rank that there are
          unavoidable religious implications
          here -- but I don't think it
          justifies taking an alarmist
          position.  Dr. Arroway is right --
          their chosen means of communication
          was a scientific one, and a
          scientific approach is probably
          appropriate, at least until the
          theological dimensions of the
          problem become more apparent.

                         ELLIE
          And where exactly does that put your
          position...?

                         JOSS
          I'd have to say I don't know enough
          to have one yet.  For the moment I
          don't believe the two approaches
          have to be mutually exclusive.

Ellie looks at him, impressed in spite of herself.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          What's the status of the decryption
          effort?

                         ELLIE
          Well --

                         DRUMLIN
          We're continuing around the clock,
          but the amount of data is enormous.
          It's difficult to tell when we'll
          find the key that will tell us the
          machine's purpose -- maybe tomorrow,
          maybe next year, maybe never.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          I want to know the minute you find
          anything.

                         DRUMLIN
          Of course, Ms. President.  We'll
          keep you fully informed.

That's the cue; most of the gathered begin to rise, make
their way to the door.  As Ellie collects her things
Drumlin accompanies her out -- then starts to shut the
door behind her --

                         DRUMLIN
          The President wants to discuss a few
          matters in private.

As Ellie looks beyond she sees that Kitz, the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs and Joss still remain.

                         ELLIE
          But --

But it's too late.  The door closes on the inner circle.

INT.  NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - RECEPTION - NIGHT

Captains of industry, social editors, minority leaders.
At least for tonight, scientists are the hottest show in
town.

Ellie stands with a group of dignitaries, straining to
make small talk.  As she glances up a familiar face
catches her eye:  Peter Valerian.

He looks up, sees her too.  A beat... he whispers
something to the young woman he's standing with; she looks
up too.  They excuse themselves to Drumlin, make their way
over.

                         PETER
          Ellie.

                         ELLIE
          Peter.

Peter extends his hand.  They shake.

                         PETER
          My wife Laura...

                         ELLIE/LAURA
          Nice to meet you.

                         PETER
                  (an awkward pause,
                   then)
          You look wonderful.

                         ELLIE
          You dress up pretty good yourself.
                  (another awkward
                   silence)
          How's... the baby?

                         LAURA
          Wonderful.  She's almost four now.

                         ELLIE
          Really.  Well.  That's wonderful...
                  (a really horrible
                   silence)
          Well.  If you'll excuse me -- I'm
          paid to mingle... I don't believe I
          just said that.

Peter and Laura laugh.  Some of the tension is diffused.
Some.

                         PETER
          It's good to see you, Ellie.

                         ELLIE
          You too.

She manages a smile, quickly hurries away.

AT THE BAR

Ellie has never needed a drink more in her life.

                         ELLIE
          Champagne please.

                         JOSS (O.S.)
          Make that two.

Ellie turns to find Joss, looking terrific in his tux.

                         JOSS
          Want to fight some more?

A long, extremely complex pause, then --

                         ELLIE
          Yes.

INT.  ANOTHER PART OF MUSEUM - NIGHT

Their voices and FOOTSTEPS ECHO as they walk past old
spacecraft.  They sip their champagne.

                         JOSS
          ... What I'm curious about are the
          wilderness years.  You're out there
          all alone, no money, mocked by the
          skeptics.  It must have taken
          tremendous faith.

                         ELLIE
          I'd say logic more than faith.  The
          odds were on my side.

                         JOSS
          And what would you have done if the
          odds had gone against you?

                         ELLIE
          I guess I would've felt sorry for
          the universe.

                         JOSS
          Spoken like a true believer.

                         ELLIE
          What about you?  Doesn't all of this
          shake your faith at all?

                         JOSS
          How do you mean?

                         ELLIE
          Well it's been a while, but I don't
          recall the Bible saying too much
          about alien civilizations.

                         JOSS
                  (thinks, then)
          'My father's house has many
          mansions.'

                         ELLIE
          Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right?
          Where I came from a palmer was a
          person who cheated at cards.
                  (as Joss laughs)
          Really though... the Bible describes
          a God who watches over one tiny
          world a few thousand years old.  I
          look out there and see a universe of
          hundreds of billions of galaxies,
          each with hundreds of billions of
          stars... I mean burn me for a
          heretic, but your God seems awfully
          small.

Joss looks at her -- challenged, intrigued.  Slowly:

                         JOSS
          Who was it who said -- it was a
          scientist I think -- that one's
          sophistication is determined by the
          ability to tolerate paradox -- to
          hold contradictory ideas at the same
          time...

They approach a circular brass railing surrounding a
circular mosaic below; at its center is a Foucault
pendulum; a basketball-sized iron sphere suspended from
the ceiling.  They lean on the railing.

                         JOSS
          ... which I suppose is as good a
          definition of faith as any.
                  (getting an idea;
                   smiles)
          Care to test yours?

He takes her champagne glass, sets it down on the floor
alongside his, then climbs under the rail.  At her
surprise --

                         JOSS
          It's okay.  I'm a preacher.

He offers her his hand.  She takes it, climbs under the
railing.  Joss helps her down into the circular space
below.

                         JOSS
          Your 'faith' tells you that the
          distance a pendulum swings from the
          vertical can never get bigger, only
          smaller.

                         ELLIE
          That's not faith, it's physics.  The
          second law of thermodynamics.

Joss places his arms around the metal ball and walks it
over to the outer rim of the circle, right in front of
Ellie's nose.

                         JOSS
          And you believe this law with all
          your heart and soul.

                         ELLIE
          And mind, yes.  What are you --

                         JOSS
          So if I let the pendulum go, when it
          swings back you wouldn't flinch.

Ellie pauses.  Then, almost curiously.

                         ELLIE
          No.

Joss lets go.  We see the ball fall away and reach the
opposite railing.  As it slows and then reverses direction
it appears to approach much faster than we expected.

                         JOSS
          Don't lean forward.  Not even a
          hair.

As it careens towards her, the ball grows alarmingly in
size.  We understand completely when the pendulum almost
reaches her and she instinctively moves.  But Ellie can't
believe it.

                         ELLIE
          I flinched.

                         JOSS
          Only a tiny bit.  Even the most
          devout believer is allowed a little
          doubt.

                         ELLIE
          That's not doubt.  That's four
          hundred years of science fighting a
          billion years of instinct.
                  (studying him)
          I always wondered what you religious
          types did with your free time.

                         JOSS
          Now you know.

EXT.  NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - NIGHT

Stars shine down as Ellie and Joss walk along the portico.
The party continues inside.  The mood is subdued,
intimate.

                         JOSS
          ... It's an old story.  I grew up in
          South Boston, more or less on the
          streets.  By the time I was thirteen
          I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by
          fifteen I'd stopped using but I was
          dealing full-time.  By the time I
          was nineteen I decided I didn't want
          to live any more, at least not in a
          world like that.  One day I got on a
          bus; I got as far as Ohio before my
          money ran out, and after that I just
          kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't
          sleep... just walked.  I ended up
          collapsing in a wheat field.  There
          was a storm... I woke up...
                  (beat)
          And that's about as far as words'll
          go.

                         ELLIE
          Can you try?

                         JOSS
          I had... an experience.  Of
          belonging.  Of unconditional love.
          And for the first time in my life I
          wasn't terrified, and I wasn't
          alone.

                         ELLIE
                  (delicately)
          And there's no chance you had this
          experience simply because some part
          of you needed to have it?

                         JOSS
          Look, I'm a reasonable person, and
          reasonably intelligent.  But this
          experience went beyond both.  For
          the first time I had to consider the
          possibility that intellect, as
          wonderful as it is, is not the only
          way of comprehending the universe.
          That it was too small and inadequate
          a tool to deal with what it was
          faced with.

                         ELLIE
                  (a beat, then
                   softly)
          You may not believe this... but
          there's a part of me that wants more
          than anything to believe in your
          God.  To believe that we're all here
          for a purpose, that all this...
          means something.  But it's because
          that part of me wants it so badly
          that I'm so stubborn about making
          sure it isn't just self-delusion.
          Of course I want to know God if
          there is one... but it has to be
          real.  Unless I have proof how can I
          be sure?

                         JOSS
          Do you love your parents?

                         ELLIE
                  (startled)
          I never knew my mother.  My father
          died when I was nine.

                         JOSS
          Did you love him?

                         ELLIE
                  (softly)
          Yes.  Very much.

                         JOSS
          Prove it.

Ellie stops and looks at him, truly disarmed.

And then, inside, a COMMOTION is heard.

INT.  NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - NIGHT

The party is suddenly and dramatically breaking up;
Senators on cell-phones, getting their coats.  Something
has happened.  Ellie finds Drumlin in the chaos, also on a
cell-phone; he hangs up as she approaches.

                         ELLIE
          What is it?  What's happened?

                         DRUMLIN
          We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found
          it.

                         ELLIE
          You mean --

                         DRUMLIN
          You were right, Ellie.  You were
          right all along.

As Ellie stares at him --

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  U.N. PLAZA - DAY

Media, onlookers, crowd control -- and delegates from over
100 countries swarm as the World Machine Consortium is
called to session.  TV lights and demonstrations.  Huge
banners read "DON'T BUILD SATAN'S CHARIOT!" and "WHO WILL
SPEAK FOR EARTH?"

INT.  U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL

Full house.  From various HEADSETS and MONITORS we hear
the POLYPHONY of a hundred simultaneous TRANSLATIONS.  On
a large screen behind the SECRETARY GENERAL'S podium and
on monitors all over the darkened room we see a single,
striking image:  A human figure inside a rotating
dodecahedron.

                         SECRETARY GENERAL
          A human has been summoned.

In the darkened hall we FIND the U.S. delegation:  Kitz,
Joss, Drumlin -- and Ellie.  We begin to PUSH IN ON her --

                         SECRETARY GENERAL
          Who will that person be?  How will
          this ambassador be chosen?

We see it in her eyes -- she wants to go, more than
anything.

INT.  U.N. - LATER

An INDIAN DELEGATE concludes her remarks.  In the audience
Ellie, deep in thought, isn't paying attention.

                         INDIAN DELEGATE
          ... of course none of us would be
          here if it weren't for the scientist
          who first discovered the history-
          making message and who has led this
          effort from the very beginning --
          Dr. Eleanor Arroway --

ELLIE

looks up in surprise.  The applause grows, becoming
deafening.  People motion for her to stand.  Dazed, she
does so.  The ovation continues.  Ellie leans over to
speak into her mike.

                         ELLIE
          Um... thanks... Thanks very much.
          I'm not sure what I did to earn that
          response; I just happened to pick up
          the phone when they called.

A big laugh, more applause.  Ellie squints into the
lights.

EXT.  U.N. PLAZA - DUSK

Floodlights illuminate the building; if anything, there
are now more onlookers and media.  The woman BBC Reporter
and her camera crew try to shoot their report amid the
noise and chaos.

                         BBC REPORTER
          ... and as the curtain falls on the
          first day of the symposium the
          question remains:  who will build
          this machine, if it indeed will be
          built -- and if it is, who will be
          selected as the Earth's first
          ambassador to another world.  This
          is Marjorie Blake, B.B.C.3, at the
          U.N.

She holds --

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          We're clear.

And the Reporter instantly sags.

INT.  U.N. LOBBY - SAME TIME

The event is breaking up; people making their way out.
Ellie waits for Drumlin to come out; goes after him --

                         ELLIE
          David --

                         DRUMLIN
          Ellie.

                         ELLIE
          Do you have a minute -- ?

                         DRUMLIN
          Actually I'm running late --

                         ELLIE
          It'll just take a moment.

Drumlin reluctantly stops; Ellie takes a deep breath.

                         ELLIE
          David... I know we've had our
          differences... but I've always
          thought of you as a fair man, even
          when we've disagreed -- and It's in
          that light I'm hoping you'll
          consider my request...

                         DRUMLIN
          I don't understand.

                         ELLIE
          I'm asking for your help, David.  I
          want to go.
                  (quickly)
          They'll need someone relatively
          young, unattached -- and probably a
          scientist.  As the President's
          Science Advisor you have enormous
          weight... I'm asking if you'll
          support my candidacy.

                         DRUMLIN
                  (slowly)
          Ellie... you should know that I'm no
          longer the President's Science
          Advisor.

                         ELLIE
          What?

                         DRUMLIN
          As of three o'clock this afternoon.
          I submitted my resignation.

Ellie's eyes open wide as the depth of his betrayal dawns.

                         ELLIE
          You...

                         DRUMLIN
                  (hesitates, then)
          Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.

He turns and walks away, leaving Ellie to stare after him.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          ... And as our parents did a
          generation before us...

INT.  U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL

Packed to the rafters.  President Lasker makes the speech
of her lifetime, her booming, amplified voice going out to
the world.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER
          ... I believe we should dedicate
          ourselves, by the end of this decade
          -- to build this machine that our
          brothers from across the vastness of
          time and space have asked us to
          build -- !

In the darkened hall the American delegation sits
watching.  PUSH IN ON Ellie.  Drumlin.  The crowd roars.

THREE APACHE HELICOPTERS

fly low over the endless Texas landscape, blue-gray in the
light of pre-dawn.  Below a convoy of military vehicles
moves down an empty road.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          To meet with courage and
          determination the challenges of this
          new day -- !

The CROWD ROARS LOUDER in VOICE OVER.

MOVING WITH the convoy...

AFS Berets sit stone-faced, barely visible.  UP ahead the
twinkling lights of an installation becomes visible.

The convoy passes through a security gate in the first
perimeter.  AFS officers check I.D. and cargo.  As the
convoy continues our VIEW begins to RISE, REVEALING three
more checkpoints beyond --

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          To greet with hope the dawn of this
          new Century!

Out VIEW continues to CLIMB, REVEALING an immense sprawl
of lights and buildings.  Concentric electric fences
surround the rambling facility; new roads are still being
added to old ones.  Encircling the installation is a vast
graveyard of discarded aircraft -- the detritus of
Twentieth Century war-making.  And in the center of it all
lies an enormous open area, its very emptiness full of
danger and promise.  Orange surveying FLAGS RUFFLE in the
BREEZE.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          And to raise our voices to the
          heavens as one world, one people, in
          one ringing, defiant declaration --
          bring on the millennium!

The ROAR of the CROWD is deafening.

The sun begins to rise over the new Los Alamos.

                                            HARD CUT TO:

INT.  OBSERVATION FACILITY (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY

An enormous multi-tiered room bustling with activity.  The
main floor consists of tables devoted to various
constituents of the international selection committee;
each area devoted to a different discipline:  medical,
psychological, philosophical, religious,
diplomatic/political, and military/communications.

The room is dominated by ten enormous overhead
viewscreens, each monitoring the activity of one of the
ten machine candidates while also displaying telemetry
readouts of their vital signs.  One candidate is
undergoing a psychological evaluation, another is visible
via infrared camera in a sensory deprivation tank; another
on a treadmill, another sleeping (EEG displayed); we also
catch brief glimpses of Ellie and Drumlin.  All are
watched with great interest by the committee members
swarming on the floor.

A level above the floor and looking out over it THROUGH
large floor to ceiling windows is the pool media area; a
group of REPORTERS and camera crews allowed limited
access, with blue-badged MACHINE SECURITY carefully
monitoring their every word.  As we MOVE THROUGH the
maelstrom we COME ACROSS a familiar face...

                         REPORTER
          I'm here with Peter Valerian,
          recently named David Drumlin's
          replacement as Science Advisor to
          the President.  Doctor, there were
          loud complaints from the
          international community last week
          when it was announced that three of
          the ten candidates -- were to be
          Americans.  How do you defend that
          decision?

                         PETER
                  (a bit nervous)
          I believe the response was somewhat
          disingenuous; when it was determined
          that national interests would be
          represented on a pay for play basis
          it was understood that the U.S., by
          shouldering close to one third of
          the financial burden, would be
          entitled to commensurate
          representation.

INSERT - TV MONITOR

                         REPORTER (V.O.)
          You've addressed the political side
          of the coin but what about the
          larger issues?  On what basis do you
          choose a human being to represent
          humanity?

We begin to WIDEN REVEALING our location in the back of a
news van, crammed with broadcasting equipment.  An
engineer monitors the signal.

                         PETER (V.O.)
          It's a good question.  Who do you
          send?  An athlete?  A religious
          leader?  A philosopher?  A soldier?
          If you don't know what the Olympic
          event will be, you send a decathlon
          champion --

                         REPORTER (V.O.)
          And if the event turns out to be
          chess?

                         PETER (V.O.)
          Yes... well, ultimately it was
          decided that the representative
          should be somebody fluent in the
          language the message was sent in --
          science.  If you'll excuse me --   

We have continued to WIDEN, finally PULLING OUT the back
of the van and CRANING UP to reveal --

EXT.  MEDIA CITY (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY

A vast encampment of vans, tents, reporters and satellite
dishes; print and video journalists from every nation.

Competing twenty-foot high skyboxes from various networks
overlook the action.  Our VIEW continues to CLIMB until
finally in the distance, wavy and hard to make out THROUGH
the LONG LENS, we can see a structure beginning to rise.
Our first glimpse of the machine.

                         CNN REPORTER
          ... and if you look closely you can
          just see the superstructure
          beginning to take shape.
          Construction on this trillion dollar
          plus effort has been complicated by
          the nearly unprecedented scale...

INT.  OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

President Lasker leans back, watching the same wavy image
on the television.  Also visible are a number of closed-
circuit monitors showing candidates.  Kitz standing behind
her, also watching.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MACHINE, TEXAS - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAWN

Bulldozers break earth as the human-designed support
structure continues to rise.

Trucks emerge from huge transport planes, carrying
enormous curved reflectors.

INT.  LAB (MACHINE, TEXAS)

Two robotic arms holding flasks of liquid are maneuvered
over a petri dish.  Scientists watch THROUGH the safe-
chamber window as a drop from each flask is carefully
placed in the dish.  Another robot arm takes the dish and
slides it under an electron microscope.

ELECTRON MICROSCOPE VIEW

Tiny crystals are forming in familiar, unearthly fractal
patterns.  Something is growing.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - DAY

An enormous high-tech crucible has been erected; gantries
and support structures rise above it.

From behind a series of protective plastic veils we see
the same chemicals we saw in the lab again being carefully
mixed together, this time in much larger proportions.

WIDE SHOT - MACHINE SUPERSTRUCTURE - DAY

PULL BACK to reveal Ellie standing at the window of her
quarters, wearing a white jumpsuit.  She slowly folds her
street clothes as she looks out at the machine.

INT.  CENTRIFUGE ROOM - DAY

One by one the candidates are whipped around the
centrifuge, subjected to higher and higher G-forces.  A
hard-eyed NASA COMMANDER watches carefully, checks the
control panel.

INT.  OBSERVATION FACILITY - DAY

The two hundred members of the ISC watch each of the
candidates' reactions.  FEATURE Joss, studying the screens
intently --

For CAPTAIN JOHN RUSSELL, a classic chiseled Astronaut
type, this is as easy as breathing.

For Drumlin it's not quite that, but he takes it,
stoically.

A flaxen-haired male candidate -- the French semioticist
(JEAN-CLAUDE) -- looks like he's about to throw up.

Ellie seems to be enjoying her self tremendously.

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Ellie, Drumlin and the eight other candidates, several
still a bit wobbly, follow the Commander down a corridor.
Jean-Claude wipes his face with a towel as he sounds off.

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
          You realize how absurd this is.
          There are no precedents here; all
          training models are useless.  Trying
          to turn us all into astronauts is a
          pathetic waste of time.

The Commander turns to him.

                         COMMANDER
          You know what, sir?  You're right.
          We have no idea whatsoever what one
          of you may encounter.  That leaves
          us with two options:  we can sit
          around and do nothing and hope for
          the best, even if that includes a
          few things that feel a little silly.
          And if one of these 'silly'
          exercises ends up saving your life
          I'll have done my job.

Jean-Claude raises an amused eyebrow, smokes his Gauloise.

HUGE MULTI-TENTACLED BEING

flashes on the screen, followed immediately by another and
another -- a rapid series of images of creatures waving
grotesque stalked appendages, horrific and bizarre.

ANGLE ON ELLIE

sitting alone in a single chair, watching the images flash
on an enormous screen.  Hardened.

INT.  OBSERVATION FACILITY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

A panel of PSYCHOLOGISTS closely monitor Ellie's reaction
on the monitors.  A PROJECT OFFICIAL approaches, watches
the monitors as he sips from a Styrofoam cup.

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          How long now?

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
          Going on five hours.

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          Ugly little suckers.

                         PSYCHOLOGIST
          Yeah.  And those are only the ones
          that live on the human body.

We MOVE AWAY FROM them to find another figure, standing
silently watching the screens.  Joss.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - DAY/NIGHT

as we CIRCLE the table, CONDENSING MONTHS of arguments and
discussions.  Trays of uneated food pile up, whiteboards
become colored with scribbled questions --

                         NIGERIAN CANDIDATE
          ... but even if somehow it has
          faster than light capacity it is
          still twenty-six years to get to
          Vega --

                         ELLIE
          That's from the point of view of
          someone on Earth -- from the
          traveler's point of view it'll only
          seem like two years...

          ... the fact is, nobody here knows
          what's gonna happen when one of us
          enters that thing.  We can guess all
          we want, but in the end... we just
          don't know...

INTERCUT WITH:

INT.  OBSERVATION FACILITY - SERIES OF DISSOLVES

The members of the philosophical committee watch, make
notes, argue passionately.  The discussion continue on
screen:

                         DRUMLIN (V.O.)
                  (on screen)
          ... Two years is still a hell of a
          long time -- and as far as we can
          tell there aren't any provisions in
          the machine design for storing food,
          water, even air...

                         ELLIE
          ... I can't believe they wouldn't
          take something as basic as our
          biological needs into account...

                         RUSSIAN CANDIDATE
          Based on what evidence?  As far as
          we know all they know about us is
          what they've learned from watching
          three minutes of German
          television... even if they do not
          mean to do damage they may do so
          inadvertently.  Look at the impact
          they've had on the world by simply
          sending the message...

                         ELLIE (V.O.)
                  (on screen)
          ... we're not looking at this from
          their point of view.  It's the first
          time this has happened to us but
          it's highly unlikely that's true for
          them as well.  Chances are they've
          been doing this for thousands if not
          millions of years...

                                            CUT TO:

SAME - REAL TIME

                         DRUMLIN
          They knew our level of development.
          If, as you say, they've done this
          many times they'd be well aware of
          the implications.

                         ELLIE
          Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all
          part of the package.  The building
          of the machine has demanded
          international cooperation on an
          unprecedented scale.  Maybe
          requiring us to come together in
          this way was, in effect, part of the
          plan.

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
          Very well.  Assume this is true.
          Assume they have only the best of
          intentions.  Suppose they decide to
          just step in and solve all our
          problems for us.  You have no
          objection to them so flagrantly
          intervening in human affairs?

                         ELLIE
          We've just lived through a century
          of incredible violence and self-
          destruction.  Do you call it
          'interventionist' when you stop a
          toddler from walking in front of a
          truck?

Before anyone can reply an out-of-breath ASSISTANT enters.

                         ASSISTANT
          Sorry to bother you but they just
          got some tape in from Japan -- I
          think you're gonna want to see this.

INT.  MAIN TESTING HANGER (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY

The vast hanger serves as home for a series of new labs
and testing areas -- state of the art, gleaming and high-
tech.  Engineers, scientists, security, and technicians
wearing blue jumpsuits and security badges are everywhere.

                         FEMALE P.A. VOICE (V.O.)
          Component test C-4-90 commencing in
          T-minus three minutes.  All
          personnel clear bay twelve; repeat,
          clear bay twelve --

We FIND Ellie.  Drumlin and the rest huddled around a
large monitor.  Also present is TEAM LEADER -- cool,
level-headed, solid.  The ultimate line producer.

                         TEAM LEADER
          This just came in from systems
          integrations in Hokkaido.

He presses play.  The monitor shows a large, apparently
empty lucite chamber.  A clock showing tenths and
hundredths of a second is inset into the screen.

                         TEAM LEADER
          The chamber contains an exotic
          substance manufactured according to
          message specifications.  In its
          normal state it appears as you see
          it, a transparent gas which is
          apparently breathable.  As you'll
          see, it also has some other...
          unusual properties.

A Japanese technician places his hand inside a waldo,
picks up a REVOLVER.  He aims it into the chamber,
FIRES --

-- as then we see the bullet slow, coming to a dead stop
in mid-air.  We see the same thing again, this time in
slow motion.  As we watch, the air in the chamber seems to
thicken around the bullet, changing from a gas to liquid,
from gel-like colloidal to diamond-hard solid in a tenth
of a second.

                         TEAM LEADER
          The substance appears to have
          intelligent multiphasic properties;
          able to shift states at will.  We
          believe it may function as some sort
          of transport medium.

                         DRUMLIN
          Now I know why the Japanese gave up
          having a candidate in exchange for
          licensing rights...

                         ELLIE
          How does it work?

                         TEAM LEADER
          We have no idea.  According to all
          known physical laws it shouldn't.

                         ELLIE
                  (murmurs)
          Magic...

                         TEAM LEADER
                  (looks at her, then)
          What you haven't seen is what
          occurred when a technician went into
          the chamber to retrieve the
          bullet... As I said, the substance
          had already been deemed breathable
          after extensive tests on laboratory
          animals.

                         DRUMLIN
          What happened?

The Team Leader pushes play.  We see the action as he
describes it:

                         TEAM LEADER
          There was apparently an aqueous
          residue covering part of the chamber
          floor.  The technician slips.  As he
          falls the substance hardens around
          him, breaking his fall...

We see the technician as his fall slows -- and then he
suddenly convulses -- and then stops, suspended at an odd
angle slightly above the ground.  He doesn't move.  Ellie,
Drumlin and the other candidates watch in horror.

                         TEAM LEADER
          ... and solidifying in his lungs and
          bloodstream, killing him instantly.

                         ELLIE
                  (shaken)
          Maybe... maybe it was an anomalous
          reaction.  Maybe when it's correctly
          integrated with other components of
          the machine...

She looks again to the eerie sight of the suspended dead
technician.  Team Leader snaps off the monitor.

                         TEAM LEADER
          Maybe.  Unfortunately that's all we
          have is maybes, increasing
          exponentially every day.  This
          machine is now building itself as
          much as we're building it.  Almost
          as if it's growing, evolving...

They all take this in... then instinctively look out the
hanger doors at the structure taking shape in the field
beyond, now rising to a height of twelve stories.  We PUSH
IN ON it...

                         TEAM LEADER (O.S.)
          It's scary, folks.  We're like
          cavemen building a nuclear warhead.
          We are constructing the most
          advanced, dangerously powerful...
          whateveritis in the history of the
          planet and we don't have a fucking
          clue how we're doing it.

CLOSE ON WHITE TABLETOP

A very sleek, low profile helmet is set down; four tiny
lenses visible near the temples.

                         PROJECT LEADER (V.O.)
          Personal recording unit.

INT.  CLEAN ROOM - DAY

Ellie, Drumlin sit around a table with other candidates.

                         PROJECT LEADER
          Normal, infrared, ultraviolet,
          stereoscopic lenses, digital
          microchip good for thousands of
          hours of recording, state of the
          art, very tough, casting good to
          15,000 degrees plus or minus.

                         DRUMLIN
          15,000 degrees... isn't that a
          little excessive?

                         PROJECT LEADER
                  (hesitates)
          Well, sir... the thinking was...

A Project Official at the back of the room steps forward.

                         PROJECT LEADER
          The thinking was that even if the
          passenger were to encounter
          conditions that were... extreme...
          there still might be a chance to
          retrieve the helmet.

INT.  OBSERVATION FACILITY

The members of the committee intently study the
candidate's reaction on the monitors; Drumlin, Ellie.
Captain Russell frowns.

EXT.  AMMUNITION RANGE - DAY

A hand holds a small, unassuming object.  It looks a
little like a car alarm beeper you'd find on a key chain.

                         PROJECT LEADER
          Lightweight, easily concealable...

Project Leader points the DEVICE at a six-inch thick steel
target five hundred yards away.  FIRES.

The target is instantly and efficiently vaporized.
Project Leader turns to the assembled candidates.

                         PROJECT LEADER
          ... and good for approximately one
          thousand uses.

                         ELLIE
          Does it dice and make julienne
          fries?

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          You have a question, Dr. Arroway?

                         ELLIE
          I question the thinking behind
          sending the first ambassador to
          another civilization in armed --
          basically announcing our intentions
          are hostile.

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          It's designed purely as a defensive
          device.  Call it a reasonable
          precaution.

                         ELLIE
          Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't
          you see the absolute absurdity of
          this?  This isn't about them, it's
          about us -- our violence, our fear
          and mistrust --

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to
          your opinion.  But we feel quite
          strongly that it would by both
          irresponsible and naive to send a
          human being into a completely
          unknown, completely uncontrollable
          situation absolutely defenseless.

                         ELLIE
          Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we
          want them to know the truth about
          who we are there's no quicker way to
          show them.

INT.  ELLIE'S QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN

Ellie walks out of the bathroom in her robe, brushing her
teeth.  She sees an envelope slipped under the door.  She
picks it up and opens it, glances over the typed agenda.
Her eye comes to something that stops her.

INT.  SMALL BRIEFING ROOM

Dark, windowless, a single lamp on.  Ellie waits at a
small table, not sure what to expect.

After a moment the door opens as a PHYSICIAN enters, 50's,
paternal.

                         PHYSICIAN
          Good morning, Dr. Arroway.

                         ELLIE
          Good morning.

He sits down opposite her.  Looks her over for a moment...
then carefully removes a small pillbox from his jacket
pocket.  He opens it, removes a small red pill and sets it
down on the table.  Ellie looks up at him.

                         PHYSICIAN
          We've been giving them to the
          astronauts since the first days of
          the Mercury program; of course it's
          never been made public.  It's fast
          and painless.  As soon as it hits
          the oral mucosa it starts to work --
          a matter of seconds, really.

INT.  MONITORING ROOM - DAY

Joss and the other members of the committee all study
Ellie's reaction intently on the monitor.  The same scene
is playing out simultaneously with the other nine
candidates on other monitors.

                         ELLIE (V.O.)
                  (on monitor, dryly)
          You want me to travel all the way to
          Vega to commit suicide?

                         PHYSICIAN (V.O.)
                  (on monitor)
          Doctor, despite your enduring faith
          that the civilization in question
          has only our best interests at
          heart, even you have to admit
          there's a possibility they might
          turn out to be... less than benign.

BACK TO ROOM

                         PHYSICIAN
          And even if they aren't, something
          else may go wrong.  There may be an
          unforeseen mechanical failure.  You
          may be marooned, unable to return.
          There are a thousand reasons we can
          think of for the occupant of the
          machine to have this with them --
          but mostly it's for the reasons we
          can't think of.

BACK TO MONITORS

Joss.  Watching.  We LEAVE him and onscreen Ellie and MOVE
TO Captain Russell's monitor.  He is also looking at the
pill --

EXT.  HOUSTON SUBURBAN HOME - BACK YARD - DAY

Scores of REPORTERS around a back yard swingset where
Russell holds his LITTLE GIRL.

                         REPORTER
                  (mike in her face)
          Say it again?  What did you tell
          your daddy?

                         RUSSELL'S LITTLE GIRL
          I don't want you to go.

                         RUSSELL
          Nothing would give me more pride
          than to represent my country and my
          world.  But what do you say to that?

INT.  ELLIE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Ellie sits on her bed watching the replay of the Russell
interview on TV.  Studies the Little Girl's smiling face
as she hugs her dad.

EXT.  MACHINE - RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

Ellie pulls out in her T-Bird.  As she drives toward the
perimeter she sees a figure walking toward her.  Joss.  He
sticks out a thumb.

EXT.  TEXAS COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Ellie tears down the highway, wind whipping her hair.
Joss is pushed back in his seat, enjoying himself
immensely.  He yells over the WIND'S ROAR:

                         JOSS
          You like to drive fast.

Ellie nods.  Floors it.

EXT.  MOUNTAINS - DAY

A beautiful meadow, a trickling stream.  Ellie and Joss
walk.

                         ELLIE
          So.  Is this kosher fraternizing
          with the enemy like this?

                         JOSS
          Some of my best friends are
          scientists.

                         ELLIE
          I was referring to the selectees
          mingling with the selectors.

                         JOSS
                  (pausing)
          Some of my best friends are
          scientists.
                  (as Ellie smiles)
          They're saying the machine is alive.

                         ELLIE
          Not exactly.  It has organic
          qualities, but we don't really
          understand how they're integrated
          with the mechanical systems.

                         JOSS
          Maybe you're creating a monster.

                         ELLIE
          I don't think so.

                         JOSS
          Why?

                         ELLIE
          It's too... elegant.  The degree of
          economy is extraordinary; it's
          really the next logical step... Even
          on Earth technology has always
          aspired to a condition of nature.
          D.N.A. outclasses any computer we
          can come up with; the human body is
          the most exquisitely designed
          machine imaginable.

                         JOSS
          In other words, God is one hell of
          an engineer.

                         ELLIE
                  (sideways smile)
          In other words.

They sit under a tree, pick at the grass.

                         JOSS
          Relativity.  Explain this to me one
          more time... even if you traveled
          near the speed of light, when you
          came back --

                         ELLIE
          If you came back.

                         JOSS
                  (after a beat)
          If you came back... you'd only be
          four years older -- but over 50
          years would have passed on Earth.

                         ELLIE
          Something like that.

                         JOSS
          And everybody you care about would
          be dead and buried.

Ellie looks up at him.

                         ELLIE
          If you came back.  If you survived
          at all.  Which it's pretty certain
          you wouldn't.

                         JOSS
          You're willing to die for this.

                         ELLIE
          It's what my whole life's been...
          aimed at; the only thing that's
          given it a sense of purpose.

She looks away.  A beat, then:

                         ELLIE
          I read your book.

                         JOSS
          Really.

          What'd you think?

                         ELLIE
          I'm more interested in the story
          behind the story... How a young man
          goes from living on the streets of
          South Boston to being the best-
          selling media figure rubbing elbows
          with the President.

                         JOSS
                  (after a pause)
          I won't deny I was ambitious.  When
          I had my... experience... I wanted
          to tell my story to as many people
          as possible.  I'm the first to admit
          that process included making some
          compromises.
                  (still seems
                   troubled; then)
          You didn't answer my question.

                         ELLIE
          I thought it was well-written.
          Heart-felt.  And a little bit
          naive... But that's just the enemy's
          perspective.

                         JOSS
          I don't consider you the enemy,
          Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get'
          technology.  I only ask the
          question:  Does it have to have all
          the answers?  I look out there and I
          see so much emptiness... People are
          so starved for meaning, and it's
          something they just don't seem to be
          getting from science.

                         ELLIE
          Did you ever stop to think that
          maybe that isn't science's fault,
          but meaning's?

                         JOSS
          I don't follow.

                         ELLIE
                  (quietly)
          Maybe the reason people are having
          trouble finding meaning isn't
          because science has obscured it...
          maybe it's just revealed it isn't
          there.

Now it's Joss' turn to be disarmed.  He looks at her;
softly:

                         JOSS
          Do you really believe your life is
          meaningless?

                         ELLIE
                  (looking away)
          I don't know.  But as a scientist I
          have to consider that possibility.

                         JOSS
          And yet you're willing to die for
          this cause, the one thing that's
          given your life a sense of purpose.
          Don't you see the contradiction
          here -- ?

                         ELLIE
          It's getting late...

                         JOSS
          What are you so afraid of, Ellie?

                         JOSS
          You're shaking.
                  (fascinated)
          You're the paradox here, Ellie.  So
          incredibly brilliant, and yet...
                  (softly)
          What does it feel like to understand
          everything in the universe except
          yourself?

She stares at him -- Joss, instantly regretting his
words --

                         JOSS
          Ellie --

                         ELLIE
          It's late.  We should go back.

She stands and starts walking briskly down the hill.

EXT.  MEDIA CITY - NIGHT

The skyboxes lit up, the satellite dishes aimed at the
stars.  Grips smoke, play cards.  Up in a skybox a
reporter vamps.

                         REPORTER (V.O.)
          ... With the machine nearing
          completion and final testing
          beginning next week, tomorrow's
          round of closed-door I.S.C.
          candidate interviews would bring to
          a close this long chapter of the
          machine drama...

INT.  MAIN AUDITORIUM (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY

Ellie is seated alone at a long table, opposite the entire
ISC.  The atmosphere is formal and tense.

                         ELLIE
                  (reading from her
                   notes)
          ... Another question I would ask
          would be a very simple one.  How did
          you do it?  How did you evolve as
          far as you have and not destroy
          yourselves?

                         JOSS
          An excellent question, Doctor.  But
          what if we don't like the answer?

                         ELLIE
          How do you mean?

                         JOSS
          What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's
          easy.  A thousand years ago our
          world was in terrible shape, our
          population out of control, violent
          crime, no food... so we called a
          general council and decided to
          eliminate the anit-social.  The
          weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And
          ever since we've been doing great.'

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          I think Reverend Joss raises an
          excellent point.  I believe we
          should discuss the formation of a
          panel to review any potentially
          delicate communications before... am
          I amusing you, Dr. Arroway?

Ellie is smiling grimly to herself, shaking her head.

                         ELLIE
          You kill me, you really do.  The
          first truly global, a-political
          event in history and you can't wait
          to spin it.

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          How would you propose we handle it,
          Doctor?

                         ELLIE
          I guess I'd say I trust us enough to
          believe our response would be
          something to the effect of, thanks
          for the advice, but no thanks.  But
          to dilute or censor the truth, for
          whatever reason --

                         PROJECT OFFICIAL
          Nobody is proposing we censor the
          truth here, Doctor.  We're simply
          talking about putting a mechanism in
          place --

                         ELLIE
          For managing the truth.  But the
          truth won't be managed, sir.  It
          stops being the truth the moment you
          try.

OFF Joss --

SAME SCENE - LATER

Ellie is making her final, prepared remarks to the
committee.

                         ELLIE
          I don't claim to be a perfect
          example of the human species... far
          from it.  But I think, paradoxically,
          that's my strength as a candidate.
          Because I think we need to share the
          truth of who we are with them -- our
          strengths --

Her eyes suddenly fall on Joss, looking at her from his
seat on the panel.  A timeless beat --

                         ELLIE
          -- and our weaknesses.  To go to
          them openly, nakedly, and say these
          are our dreams, these are our fears.
          What I'm saying, ladies and
          gentlemen, is that I believe we
          should make this journey with
          honesty and integrity or not at all.

The words are spoken with passion and conviction, but
something tells us this isn't playing in Peoria.  Ellie
looks uncertain.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Drumlin in the chair.  Reassuring, smooth -- statesman-
like.

                         DRUMLIN
          Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you
          today not only as a scientist, but
          as a politician -- an occupation
          for which I make no apologies.
          With all due respect to Doctor
          Arroway's talk of naked honesty and
          integrity -- high ideals, to be
          sure -- I believe it would be
          foolish and, in fact, dangerous to
          ignore the fact that what we are
          dealing with here is a political
          situation -- the most political of
          situations -- and one that must be
          examined in that context.

INT.  AIR FORCE ONE (40,000 FEET) - DAY

The President, watching Drumlin on closed circuit.  An
aide hands her a cup of coffee.  She sips it, her eyes
never leaving the screen.

                         DRUMLIN (V.O.)
                  (on screen)
          The image we put forth, the
          impressions we give may determine
          precedent for decades if not
          millennia to come.

BACK TO AUDITORIUM - TIGHT ON DRUMLIN

                         DRUMLIN
          We must be optimistic enough to hope
          for the best -- and wise and
          experienced enough to prepare for
          the worst.

A murmur of assent from the ISC.  Drumlin continues.

                         DRUMLIN
          Ladies and gentlemen.  I'm proud of
          what we've achieved as a species and
          a civilization.  I would hate to see
          all that we stand for, all that
          we've fought for for a thousand
          generations, slighted, taken
          advantage of, or God forbid, done in
          by the fact that at the final hour
          we chose to send a representative
          who didn't put our best interests
          first.

EXT.  MACHINE, TEXAS - DUSK

Ellie walks out.  She stands looking at the machine in the
distance.  It is almost complete; the enormous gantries
partly obscuring the gigantic sphere that is the machine's
outer benzel.  Another figure stands nearby, smoking in
the shadows.

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
          I am become death; the destroyer of
          worlds.
                  (takes a puff)
          I wonder if this is how Oppenheimer
          felt on the eve of the first A-bomb
          test.

Ellie steps closer.  The Frenchman smiles at Ellie, offers
her a cigarette.  She shakes her head.

                         ELLIE
          I'd say this is slightly different.

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
          Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that
          it is a 'doomsday device' of some
          kind, I plan to be very far away
          from your lovely Texas when it is
          activated.

                         ELLIE
          I thought you were here because you
          want to go.

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
          I do.  More than anything.  But I am
          also a realist.  Soon this... what
          is your charming term -- ?  Dog and
          pony show will finally be over, and
          I will go home.

                         ELLIE
          You're implying that the whole
          selection process is a sham?

                         JEAN-CLAUDE
                  (smiles)
          I think it is your naivete I like
          best about you, Eleanor.  Oh,
          there'll be a worldwide protest, but
          we all knew it from the very
          beginning.  You Americans discovered
          the signal, you led the decryption
          effort.  The machine is being built
          on your home soil... Of course the
          passenger will be an American,
          chosen by Americans.
                  (expansively)
          Anyway, it is what the whole world
          wants, no?  This is the big show.
          The sort you put on better than
          anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's
          good casting.  It's the American way.

EXT.  LANDING STRIP (MACHINE, TEXAS) - NIGHT

Air Force One sits on the tarmac.  The lights inside are
burning.

INT.  AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

President Lasker, Kitz, Joss and Valerian sit around a
table.

                         KITZ
          It's not even close.  Arroway may be
          a good, even great scientist, but
          she's politically tone-deaf and a
          loose cannon.  She leaked the
          message without so much as a nod to
          the D.O.D. or N.S.C., and I don't
          think anybody here would say
          diplomacy's her strong suit.
          Drumlin may not be as glamorous a
          choice, but he's reliable,
          patriotic, sound.  He has impeccable
          scientific credentials.  And I think
          he'd be perceived by the public as
          the safer choice.

The President taps her cigarette, turns to Peter.

                         PETER
          It's her discovery, Ms. President.
          She deserves to go.

The President frowns.  Turns to Joss.  Slowly.

                         JOSS
          I've been watching and getting to
          know Eleanor Arroway for some time
          now... and I can say unequivocally,
          that I have never before met a human
          being with such extraordinary faith.
          In humanity... and in our right to a
          place of importance in the cosmos.

Peter watches Joss as he speaks, and as he listens, we
hear too:  There's more than simple admiration for Ellie
in Joss' voice.

                         JOSS
          I believe that the person we're
          selecting will play a crucial role
          in humanity's future.  I believe
          that when this person comes back --
          if they come back -- they will be
          seen as being anointed by a higher
          intelligence, and may well emerge as
          one of the most important people on
          Earth.  It may be true that Eleanor
          Arroway is not a perfect human being
          -- but I believe her honesty, her
          purity, and her integrity to be
          unimpeachable.  Ms. President --
          aren't those qualities that this
          representative should embody?  Are
          we seriously considering choosing a
          man who openly claims that he stands
          for nothing more than political
          self-interest to be the one person
          to represent the human race?

The President.  Unreadable.

INT.  MAIN AUDITORIUM (MACHINE, TEXAS)

The SRO press conference/media event -- the Superbowl,
Olympics and Oscar night all rolled into one.  Government
officials, diplomats, ISC.  The seven remaining candidates
(the Frenchman conspicuously absent) sit in the front row.
Ellie.  Drumlin.

The SECRETARY GENERAL of the U.N. at the podium.

                         SECRETARY GENERAL
          The International Selection
          Committee has come to a decision,
          ladies and gentlemen, and may I say,
          I think it has been a great
          oversight on the part of the Vegans
          not to build a few more seats on the
          boat...
                  (off polite laughter)
          But only one human being can go, and
          that person, the person we feel best
          represents the world, is the
          candidate from the United States of
          America, Doctor David Drumlin.

Drumlin closes his eyes in triumph, a long, deep breath.

Ellie.  Expressionless.

Joss.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  ELLIE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Ellie is packing.  A discreet KNOCK at the door.  Drumlin
enters.  An awkward beat.  He notices the suitcase.

                         DRUMLIN
          You aren't staying?

                         ELLIE
          This... seemed best.

                         DRUMLIN
          Right.  Well.

                         ELLIE
                  (after a beat)
          Good luck, David.

Drumlin pauses.  Nods, starts to go... then stops at the
door.

                         DRUMLIN
          Ellie... we both know that if I was
          any kind of a man, I never would've
          entered this race.  That I would
          have told the President straight
          out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is
          naive and strident and an enormous
          pain in the ass... but she's got
          more courage and intelligence than
          the rest of us put together.  That
          more then anyone else on the planet,
          she's earned this.  And that she
          should be the one to go because
          she's the best we have.
                  (beat)
          But that's not who I am.  I like to
          think it's who I might've been if
          things had gone a different way;
          that I might have been worthy,
          really worthy of what I've been
          given...
                  (shrugs)
          You do what you have to do.  And in
          the end, as with everything, it
          comes down to power.  And it isn't
          fair...

                         ELLIE
                  (quietly)
          What would you have me say, David?

                         DRUMLIN
          Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to
          thank you.

                         ELLIE
          Thank you?

                         DRUMLIN
                  (nods)
          For giving me a chance, just for a
          moment, to feel what it must be like
          to be you.

And he turns and goes, closing the door behind him.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  SMALL TOWN (TEXAS) - DAWN

Local residents and children watch in awe as a huge convoy
of super-human scale passes through the one-street town.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - DAY

The convoy heads through the gates and arrives at the
machine site.  Enormous winches are wheeled in place;
cables attached.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX (MACHINE) - DAY

Ellie packs the last of her things in the back of her
T-Bird.  She notices the activity at the machine site,
keeps packing.

INT.  MACHINE CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Large windows, monitors look out on the machine
superstructure.  Drumlin is surrounded by technicians;
Team Leader is at the main console; several of the ex-
candidates chat, smoke in back.  Kent sucking on a
lollipop.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Ellie ROARS down the deserted highway, her hair blowing.
She floors it.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

The enormous erbium dowels are hoisted into place.

Positioned at the side of the outer benzel and aligned for
insertion.

Finally in place, an ALARM SOUNDS; all workers begin to
leave the area of the superstructure.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The technicians fit Drumlin with a high-tech video
headset.

EXT.  ROADSIDE BAR - DAY

Somewhere in West Texas.  Ellie pulls up in cloud a of
dust.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - DAY

We see a technician in a hard-hat walking towards one of
the superstructure's elevators.  As he approaches, we
recognize Joseph, now clean-shaven, wearing spectacles.

INT.  ROADSIDE BAR - DAY

HANK WILLIAMS ON the JUKEBOX.  Ellie sits on a barstool.
The BARTENDER approaches, recognizes her -- she sees he
sees -- and then he nods, treats her like any other
customer.

                         BARTENDER
          What can I get you, pretty lady?

                         ELLIE
          Beer, please.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - DAY

Joseph rides the elevator up the gantry.  Under his vest
we can see his body wrapped with plastic explosives.

EXT.  MEDIA CITY - DAY

Business as usual.  Reporters nap under flapping tents.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Everyone watches as the enormous dowel is positioned
beside a giant sphere of the machine and prepared for
insertion.  Then Team Leader spots something on one of the
monitors -- he enlarges the image -- Joseph climbing onto
one of the dowels.  Team Leader pushes the abort button.
ALARMS SOUND as the controllers panic -- Drumlin looks
around in confusion --

JOSEPH

stands next to the sphere, puts a hand out to touch it.  A
last look up to heaven -- and then he EXPLODES in a BALL
of FLAME --

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Everyone freezes -- a timeless moment... and then, as the
smoke begins to clear, we see the damage to the machine is
minimal.  Drumlin exhales.  Everyone breathes a nervous
sigh of relief --

-- and then one of the MONITORS begins to RATTLE.

EXT.  MACHINE SITE - DAY

The entire SUPERSTRUCTURE begins to RUMBLE.  A giant
erbium dowel shudders downwards, crashing into the sphere
and ripping a hole in the machine.  The controllers stare
as another EXPLOSION rents the bottom of the machine,
weakening the support structure.  Gantries begin to
collapse around it as the giant sphere falls off its
support --

EXT.  MACHINE OUTER PERIMETER - DAY

Workers stare in amazement -- and then start running --

EXT.  MEDIA CITY - DAY

Reporters look up at the SOUNDS of DESTRUCTION --

EXT.  MACHINE SITE

The SPHERE IMPLODES in a blinding flash of light.  Time
and gravity seem suspended as debris gets sucked into an
eerily vacuole of nothingness -- as if for a moment, the
space around the machine is turning inside out -- and then
the VACUOLE EXPLODES in a unearthly FIREBALL of nuclear
proportions.

WIDE SHOT

The fireball begins to expand, the shockwave spreading out
to envelop the entire facility.  Bodies are tossed through
the air like rag dolls.  The blast wave approaches the
control tower --

INT.  CONTROL TOWER - DAY

The occupants stare in horror as the shock wave approaches
-- Team Leader -- Drumlin -- it hits --

INT.  ROADSIDE BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

A TV above the bar plays an afternoon talk show
("Intergalactic Fashions -- today on Geraldo") as Ellie
nurses her second beer.

Suddenly a LOW RUMBLE is heard, barely on the threshold of
sound.  GLASSES RATTLE in their racks -- and then the TV
GOES OFF, followed by the lights and the JUKEBOX.  PUSH IN
ON Ellie as she looks up at the frightened Bartender --

                         ELLIE
          How far away are we from --

                         BARTENDER
          Two hundred miles.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AFTERMATH

An eerie silence.  The remains of the superstructure burns
quietly.

Media city lays in ruins; the toppled skyboxes blaze.
Dozens of flaming satellite dishes point impotently at the
sky.

... And, nearby, Drumlin's video headset, quietly
smoldering.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY

A light drizzle falls.  President Lasker reaches down to a
large marble slab and ignites an eternal flame that wavers
in the wind and drizzle before burning fiercely.

ANGLE

MUFFLED DRUMS ROLL.  A state funeral for all who perished
in the machine disaster.  Peter, his wife beside him;
Joss, quietly praying.  Ellie stands alone.

HADDEN'S MONITOR WALL (LOCATION UNKNOWN)

CNN coverage of the funeral continues.  As we SLOWLY
WIDEN, the next monitor over shows footage of the
destruction at Machine, Texas; FBI sharpshooters and
police firing into a run-down motel; an amateur video of
Joseph's suicide note.  He is spookily well-spoken, calm:

                         JOSEPH (V.O.)
                  (on monitor)
          What we do, we do for the good of
          all mankind.  This will not be
          understood, not now, but the
          apocalypse to come will vindicate
          our faith...

We CONTINUE TO WIDEN as a pair of familiar glasses float
INTO VIEW; a gnarled hand plucks them from mid-air as
Hadden turns to look out a panorama window showing a
breathtaking view of Earth from 250 miles out in space.

EXT.  EARTH ORBIT - 250 MILES UP

A privatized space shuttle breaks through the atmosphere
and heads towards the Russian space station Mir -- which
now bears the Hadden Industries logo.

INT.  MIR DOCKING BAY (SPACE)

The shuttle nestles with a CLANK against the station.  Air
floods the chamber and the locked door opens.

The Japanese Major Domo we saw at Hadden's plane appears
in the hatchway; Ellie a moment later.  He points toward
the other end of the airlock.  Ellie starts to glide-walk
through, glancing back to see the Major Domo gesturing to
three, very young, very beautiful women with empty eyes.
Ellie keeps moving...

INT.  MIR SPACE STATION - STATEROOM/STUDY

Compact but luxurious.  Earth is visible through a
panorama window.  Hadden floats before it, curled up with
arthritis like a dying insect.  Ellie moves beside him.

                         HADDEN
          A sunrise and a sunset every forty-
          five minutes.

                         ELLIE
          It's so... small.

                         HADDEN
          Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we
          feasted on her.  And now that we've
          had our fill and given her a giant
          dose of the clap... we're pulling
          out.
                  (points)
          That's Paris, where my daughter was
          born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule
          the night and I gave up smoking.  So
          many battles, so many lives... all
          that sturm, and drang.  As if it
          never happened.  If it weren't for a
          few power grids, you wouldn't know
          we existed.

The sun begins to set.  They watch the stunning transition
as night comes on.  The Boston-New York corridor appears
as a glittering necklace of light; a tropical storm brews
in the Caribbean.  Ellie points to a sparkling glow in the
Pacific.

                         ELLIE
          What's that?

                         HADDEN
          Japanese squid fleet.  They use
          lights to attract them to the
          surface... then turn them into
          sushi.

Ellie traces the magical glow with her finger on the
window.

                         ELLIE
          It looks like pixie dust...
                  (beat)
          Kent would've given anything to see
          this.  David, too.

                         HADDEN
          Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be
          worse if they died for nothing.

                         ELLIE
          What are you talking about?  It's
          over.

                         HADDEN
          Oh, not quite yet.  At least for
          their sake...
                  (indicates the Earth)
          ... I hope it's not.  Because
          they're running out of time.

                         ELLIE
          You sound like Joseph.  You think
          the world ends with the millennium?

                         HADDEN
          I think whoever sent the message did
          it because they're worried about us.

                         ELLIE
          The gods sent us the machine because
          they took pity on us.

                         HADDEN
          Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on
          TV?
                  (then)
          Come; I want to show you something.

He reaches up to the ceiling, punches a button.  A large
display appears, showing the Earth.  He enlarges the
display until only Japan is visible, then only a large
island to the north --

                         HADDEN
          Hokkaido Island.

                         ELLIE
          The systems integration site.

                         HADDEN
          Mmm.  Look closer.

The display enlarges still further, revealing more and
more detail -- until it comes to rest on a familiar
gantry-enveloped sphere, surrounded by hundreds of ant-
like technicians...

A second machine.

                         HADDEN
          As each component was tested and
          shipped off to Texas a duplicate was
          maintained and assembled in Hokkaido
          -- for backup purposes, of course.
          We've been right behind you the
          entire time.
                  (as Ellie is stunned)
          You see my problem:  I couldn't
          appear to control too large a
          percentage; my enemies wouldn't
          stand for it.  So I simply made sure
          the Japanese consortium received the
          systems integration contract.  Of
          course no one had to know the
          corporations involved were recently
          acquired, wholly-owned
          subsidiaries --

                         ELLIE
          -- of Hadden Industries.

Ellie is nonplused.  Hadden smiles dazzlingly.

                         HADDEN
          Want to take a ride?

EXT.  SPACE STATION MIR

The sun rises over the Earth like a dazzling jewel.

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Hadden glide-walks Ellie to the airlock.  They share one
last look at the magnificent view of Earth -- then she
turns to him:

                         ELLIE
          Why don't you come back with me?

                         HADDEN
          Can't.  Doctor's orders.
                  (pausing)
          The low oxygen/zero gravity
          environment is the only thing
          keeping the cancer from eating me
          alive.
                  (laughs at Ellie's
                   shock)
          It's all right -- I like it here.
          Ever try sex in zero-G?

He raises an eyebrow.  Ellie smiles, then steps into the
airlock.  They face each other.  Hadden pauses before
closing it.

                         HADDEN
          One more thing, Doctor.  If you do
          meet these Vegans...?  Ask them if
          we have to die.

ELLIE'S POV FROM SHUTTLE - MINUTES LATER

The umbilicals release; the shuttle drifts away.  Hadden
watches from his panorama window, small, motionless, as
Mir recedes and the shuttle retros back towards Earth.

EXT.  SEA OF JAPAN - AERIAL POV - DAY

We RUSH DOWN THROUGH the clouds to Hokkaido Island,
DESCENDING PAST the snow-covered peaks of Saporro TO...

EXT.  OBIHIRO VILLAGE (HOKKAIDO ISLAND) - DUSK

A shimmering vision of the machine sits in the middle of
the square; after a moment we realize it is made of ice.
Japanese artisans chip and grind, putting the finishing
touches on the enormous sculpture.

                         REPORTER (O.S.)
          ... it would be fair to say an
          upbeat atmosphere prevails here; the
          Japanese playing their role of host
          impeccably.

The promenade, decorated with colorful banners for the
Winter Festival, is alive with activity; street vendors
and film crews abound.  We BOOM DOWN to include the
REPORTER in the f.g.:

                         REPORTER
          And there is reason for optimism:
          the way the machine consortium has
          bounced back in these last few
          months is nothing short of
          miraculous, and that restored sense
          of hope and purpose is clearly in
          evidence here today.

INT.  HOKKAIDO COMPOUND - PRESS CONFERENCE/PHOTO OP (MOS)

Madhouse.  CAMERA WHIR and CLICK, REPORTERS shout
questions.  Ellie squints in the glare of the lights,
overwhelmed.

                         REPORTER (V.O.)
          But look beneath the surface and you
          can clearly sense a darker mood here
          -- an undercurrent of apprehension
          and fear as tomorrow approaches.
          And questions:  What awaits the
          world at the end of the long road to
          Hokkaido?  What will happen when the
          machine is finally activated?  And
          what must Eleanor Arroway be feeling
          on this, what may well be her last
          night on Planet Earth...?

EXT.  JAPANESE INN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

An ancient, elegant structure.  Security posted outside.

INT.  ELLIE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Cherry wood and rice paper; candles, orchids... and a
jumpsuit hanging in the corner.

Ellie paces restlessly.

Tries to read a book.

Tries to write a letter... crumples it up.

Ellie lays down on the bed.  A goldfish bowl sits on the
nightstand.  Ellie peers at it THROUGH the glass.

And then she hears a sound; the CRUNCHING of FOOTSTEPS on
PEBBLES.  Ellie sits up:  a silhouette is visible THROUGH
the rice paper wall.  She goes to the door, slides it
open --

-- revealing Palmer Joss, rumpled and jetlagged, holding a
sorry-looking bouquet of airport flowers.

                         JOSS
          You didn't think I was going to let
          you leave without saying good-bye...

A long moment... and then she embraces him.

                         JOSS
          Ellie... the last time we spoke... I
          said some things...

                         ELLIE
          I remember.  You were indelicate,
          indiscreet and entirely less than
          tactful... Sound like anyone you
          know?

He smiles, grateful.  A moment.

                         JOSS
          So.  The final countdown.

                         ELLIE
          The final countdown.

                         JOSS
                  (remembering)
          Oh.  I brought you something.

From his jacket he produces a small palm frond, presents
it to her.  She takes it, looks at him quizzically.

                         JOSS
          During the crusades -- pilgrims who
          made the journey to the holy land
          brought back a palm frond to show
          they'd actually been there.  I
          thought it sort of made sense that
          Earth is now your holy land, so...

                         ELLIE
                  (visibly moved)
          Thank you.

Joss takes her hand.

                         JOSS
          You're trembling.

                         ELLIE
          I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm
          just a little bit terrified about
          tomorrow.

                         JOSS
                  (softly)
          Maybe that's okay.

She looks up at him, utterly vulnerable.  He raises his
hand to her cheek... then leans in and kisses her.

It's a very good kiss.

They kiss again, more passionately... and then Ellie pulls
away.

                         JOSS
                  (softly)
          What...?

                         ELLIE
          I'm sorry.

                         JOSS
          What is it?

And suddenly she's crying, trying desperately to stop --
Joss puts his hands on her shoulders --

                         JOSS
          Ellie, what is it?

                         ELLIE
          I'm sorry -- I can't --

                         JOSS
          What?

                         ELLIE
          I can't do this --

                         JOSS
          What are you so afraid of?

                         ELLIE
          Please, Palmer -- if you care for me
          at all, don't push this now --

                         JOSS
          What are my other options?  In fifty
          years?  Never?

                         ELLIE
          Please --

                         JOSS
          I'm in love with you, Ellie.

                         ELLIE
                  (stares, then)
          Don't you understand?  I just have
          to hold it together -- just until
          tomorrow --

                         JOSS
          And then what?  Then you'll be safe?

                         ELLIE
          -- I don't know --

                         JOSS
                  (intensely)
          Do you really think your life is
          meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why
          you're so quick to risk it --
          because if your life means nothing
          then you have nothing to lose?

                         ELLIE
          I can't hear this now --

                         JOSS
          Ellie, there is no reason you have
          to be alone.

                         ELLIE
                  (looking up;
                   helpless)
          And yet that's always how I seem to
          end up, isn't it?
                  (a moment)
          If you really do love me, Palmer,
          you'll leave.  Now.  Please.

She pulls away from him, leaving the room.  Joss stands
looking after her... then goes to the door... exits.
Ellie watches from the doorway...

Floodlights illuminate the machine superstructure with
intense light.  Technicians in blue jumpsuits, many of
them Japanese, swarm around the instrument/camera
bleachers.

While the Hokkaido machine differs somewhat from the one
in Texas in the details of its human-designed
superstructure, the eerie uniformity of the giant sphere,
here bathed in soft lavender light, is the same.

Elaborate instrument and camera bleachers surround it; in
the distance we can make out a control tower similar to
the one we saw vaporized in Texas.

          happening.

                         PETER

          It's really happening.

          Like it.  Almost there.

ELLIE

approaches the alien fractal-embossed surface of the
machine.

She pauses.  Looks around -- her last glimpse of Earth...?

She takes a step -- and as she does the panel before her
loses its solidity, becoming an opaque gray mist.
Darkness beyond.

Ellis is on the threshold.

A million people hold their breath --

Tiny Ellie disappears into the machine.

INT.  MACHINE

As Ellie enters, the panel silently resolidifies behind
her.

                         ELLIE
                  (murmurs)
          That's one small step for a woman...

Darkness.  A dim glow ahead shows through similar openings
in two more spherical benzels.  The surface beneath
Ellie's feet seems almost liquid.  She continues...

INT.  OUTER DODECAHEDRON

The enormous chamber is webbed with delicate
organosilicate implanted pattern.  An inner dodecahedron
marks the core of the machine.  Ellie steps through,
staring in wonder.

          What?

                         A.T.L.
          I'm not sure.  We have no launch
          protocol; the entry of the passenger
          is supposed to initiate activation.

                         PETER
                  (into chin mic)
          Anything happening in there, El?

                   herself to calm)
          Arroway to Control, do you copy?

INT.  COMMAND BRIDGE

The BENZELS have begun to generate a HARMONIC HUM, each
generating a DIFFERENT TONE.  It grows LOUDER as they
continue to pick up speed --

                         A.T.L.
          We've lost contact.

                         PETER
          Pull the plug.  Get her out of
          there.

                         A.T.L.
          There's no plug to pull.

                         PETER
          What?

                         A.T.L.
          There is no abort procedure -- we
          don't know how we turned the damn
          thing on, let alone how to turn it
          off.

Peter stares at the spinning benzels, rapidly gaining
speed.  Palmer Joss closes his eyes and quietly starts to
pray.

INT.  MACHINE

Something is happening inside the machine; a shimmering,
almost as if the air itself was changing...

                         ELLIE
          Control, I'm going to continue
          broadcasting on the assumption...
          hope... that you can hear me.  The
          atmosphere within the chamber seems
          to be undergoing some sort of
          spontaneous state conversion...

The shimmering amber-lit gas surrounds Ellie, in some
places remaining gaseous (for breathing); in others
aqueous, in others a gel-like colloidal, supporting her.
Nervously:

                         ELLIE
          My breathing seems normal...

The MACHINE SHUDDERS.

                         ELLIE
          What was that -- ?

FROM TWO MILES OUT AT SEA

We see clouds gather; an ominous microclimate forming over
Hokkaido.  Strange violet-hued lights in the sky --

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

The HUM of BENZELS is deafening, like a galactic choir --

INT.  VLA - SAME TIME

Fisher, Willie and the team are glued to the set.

INT.  CAMP DAVID - SAME TIME

President Lasker and Kitz watch the same coverage.

INT.  MIR - SAME TIME

Hadden floating, silhouetted against his TV wall.

EXT.  MACHINE

The lower support structure begins to withdraw but the
enormous sphere remains spinning freely in space -- the
clouds part --

ELLIE

whirls around in terror as the light grows dazzlingly
bright.

FULL SHOT - MACHINE

Suddenly the benzels flicker -- go transparent --
everything is visible for a millisecond as a blinding
flash of light illuminates the superstructure and
surrounding countryside brighter than the brightest day --

INT.  CONTROL ROOM - SAME MOMENT

Monitors whiteout in a blaze of blinding light.

INT.  MIR STATION

Hadden's TV wall whites out as he dies smiling --

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MACHINE

The sense of acceleration is tremendous, as if dropping
through the center of the earth.  The fluid has become
more gel-like solid, supporting Ellie's body.  The front
panel is now opaque, the left and right panels semi-
transparent.

A bright blue-white light up ahead, illuminating what
seems not so much to be a tunnel as a sense of space
warping around us; like being inside a fisheye lens as it
dolly/zooms.  Ellie speaks breathlessly into her mike...

                         ELLIE
          I'm falling... sense of enormous
          acceleration.  It's a wormhole, it's
          got to be, but how do they keep it
          stable?  The energy required --

Now the front panel becomes transparent:  Ahead is a
dazzlingly bright blue-white object with dimmer copies of
it surrounding it.

As speed increases the subsidiary images become fainter,
moving in a transverse circle.  Behind Ellie, though she
doesn't see it, the panels show similar images of the
launch site at Hokkaido.  The blue-white light from up
ahead becomes blinding as the Dodec erupts into space.

                         ELLIE
          It's a star, I'm in orbit around a
          star, spectral type A, maybe early
          F.  Getting weird multiple images
          here; relativity effects?
          Accretion disk... gotta be Vega,
          only... oh my God...

A great mass passing above eclipses Vega's light, throwing
the Dodec into shadow.  The immense polyhedron construct
from the opening of the film, dappled with its millions of
transmitters, drifts overhead.  It's easily 100 miles
across.  Staring in awe:

                         ELLIE
          They're talking to the whole
          universe... Okay, okay, clearly
          artificial, some sort of relay
          station but the scale is just...
          tens of thousands of receivers,
          hundreds... some sort of
          biotechnology, like the machine
          but... don't see anything like a
          docking port...

The machine suddenly makes a hard left; an object appears
ahead, an impossible inside-out sphere in space; four
dazzling lights seem to be embedded within it.

                         ELLIE
          Another wormhole?  Bigger this time
          -- oh God --

The Dodec plunges down it as Ellie struggles to contain
her wildly fluctuating emotions.  The surrounding gas
begins to shift color, modulate --

                         ELLIE
          Okay.  Okay.  A series of wormholes,
          linked together, artificially
          created, but why would...?
                  (then)
          Jesus, it's a subway system.

The Dodec erupts into a quadruple star system.  A pair of
red and blue stars orbit each other while a pair of
yellow-green dwarfs orbit them.

Ellie swallows hard, hyperventilating --

                         ELLIE
          Quadruple system... incredible...
          don't recognize any background
          constellations... hundreds, possibly
          thousands of light years from Earth
          now.  So beautiful.  So...

Ellie growing woozy; trying to snap out of it.

                         ELLIE
          The physics must be a thousand, ten
          thousand years beyond us but... oh
          God... oh God something's...
          happening...

Ellie is overwhelmed with emotion -- we think she's about
to cry but then she bursts out laughing --

                         ELLIE
          It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  I
          keep saying that but I can't... my
          mind can't... words... should've
          sent a poet.  I'm a poet and don't
          know it...
                  (sings)
          Ground control to Major Tom...
                  (struggling)
          Relativitistic side-effect?  Or --
          induced by the transport medium?
          The gas...

Now Ellie is crying, sobbing uncontrollably.

                         ELLIE
          Oh, Palmer, I wish I'd had a baby.

The Dodec plunges into another inside-out sphere, this one
larger and glowing blood red --


SERIES OF SHOTS

A)  A GIANT RED STAR

    As it engulfs an Earthlike planet.  We watch the
    planet's oceans boil away; the surface chars, sears
    dead --

B)  SUPERNOVA

    Tidal waves of gas clouds rush away from the exploding
    sun -- shock waves tumble debris AT us.  At the center
    of the cataclysm a rapidly rotating neutron star
    flashes like a lighthouse, ten times a second.

C)  LARGE BLUE GAS GIANT

    Circling an emerald green star.  On the night side of
    the planet are huge glowing jellyfish-like shapes, the
    floating cites of an alien civilization.  Millions of
    glowing gold particles connect them in elaborate
    swirling patterns, a dance of golden glitter...

D)  LAST WORMHOLE

    choked with multicolored pinprick flares -- a sense of
    tremendous acceleration, finally erupting into --

CENTER OF GALAXY

So many dazzling multicolored stars they almost touch.
Millions more stars than are visible from Earth on the
clearest night.

An immense, spiraling river of gas and dust, millions of
miles long, pours into the maw of a black hole of
staggering dimensions.  Flashes of radiation leap from the
center like summer lightning --

                         ELLIE
          The center of the galaxy...

The Dodec suddenly rotates.  Swimming INTO OUR FIELD OF
VIEW...

GALACTIC GRAND CENTER STATION

It fills half the sky.  A vast vast artificial planet;
immeasurably immense liquid clouds drift in its
atmosphere, punctuated by planet-size holes, columns of
mist thousands of mile high.

The Dodec gently plunges into an atmosphere of blue night;
below we can make out thousands of yellow-lit openings in
the gel-like surface, each a different geometric shape.

                         ELLIE
          Docking ports... those are docking
          ports for other machines... hi,
          everybody...

As the Dodec continues to lower toward a hexagonal
receptor the panels grow opaque, blocking out all light.
Ellie fights to remain conscious as it grows dimmer and
dimmer:

                         ELLIE
          Now arriving Grand Central
          Station... floating down...
          floating...
                  (like a little girl)
          Twinkle twinkle... little star...
          how I wonder... ellemenopee...
                  (shaking her head)
          ... have to stay awake... stay
          awake...
                  (slipping)
          Please... please...

She passes out.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

IN BLACK

Nothing.  Still nothing.  Finally, a gentle, familiar
SOUND...

FADE IN:

ELLIE

lies in a fetal position.  After a long moment she opens
her eyes.  The familiar RHYTHMIC sound is LOUDER.  Her
eyes widen...

EXT.  BEACH - DAWN

Ellie sits up on a pristine white beach.  Huge ranges of
cumulus lit red/gold by the dawn silhouette clusters of
palm trees; the sound of gently ROLLING SURF, SQUAWKING
GULLS.

Ellie stands.  The Dodec is nowhere to be seen.  She looks
around in disbelief.

She takes a few halting steps, like a child learning to
walk.  She kneels, scoops up some sand.  Frowns in
confusion...

Ellie digs her hand into the sea, almost loses her balance
again.  She tastes the water.  Normal.  Her confusion
grows...

                         ELLIE
          I... remember this...

She steps further into the water; letting its warmth
soothe her, wipes the furrows from her brow.  Closes her
eyes as she lets the water take her.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

The sun is higher now.  The SURF CRASHES.

                         ELLIE (O.S.)
          Recording... check, check.
          Recording, is this on?  I think this
          is on.

Ellie sits against a palm tree, looking out at the sea.
She seems a little more cogent.

                         ELLIE
          Okay.  I've traveled thirty thousand
          light years, give or take a few
          parsecs, to go to the beach.  So...
          Either they've created this
          environment... or the illusion of
          this environment, to make me feel at
          home... or else somehow I am at home
          -- or else this is my cage at the
          intergalactic zoo and the tour bus
          will be along any minute...

A distant figure becomes visible down the beach.  As it
approaches Ellie continues, unaware:

                         ELLIE
          Or else, of course, I'm completely
          insane.  This should not be
          discounted as a possibility --
          although the fact that I'm
          questioning my sanity should be a
          pretty good indication that I am in
          fact sane... unless of course...
          unless...

Ellie stops, as if sensing something.  The figure grows
closer, now clearly humanoid.  Ellie turns to look --

-- and stares in utter disbelief.  She rises to her
feet...

ELLIE'S POV

Ted Arroway is walking easily toward her.  He smiles.

                         TED
          Morning, Captain.

ELLIE

Tears come to her eyes... she approaches, staring... He
takes her hand --

                         TED
          I've missed you.

It's too much.  Ellie throws herself into his arms, holds
him tight.

                         ELLIE
          Dad...

She sobs.  He holds her.

                         TED
          It's okay...

Ellie recovers a bit, wiping away her tears --

                         ELLIE
          I used... I used to dream you were
          alive... and then I'd wake up and
          lose you all over again.

                         TED
          I'm sorry I couldn't be there for
          you, sweetheart.

                         ELLIE
          Dad... But tell me, how did... I
          mean how can...?

Reality returns like a cloud passing over the sun.
Softly:

                         ELLIE
          You're not real.  None of this is.

                         TED
                  (smiles sadly)
          That's my scientist.

                         ELLIE
                  (struggling to
                   breathe)
          So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or
          are little gear trains and circuit
          boards under your skin?

                         TED
          Am I artifact or dream?  You might
          ask that about anything.

                         ELLIE
          But you're so... I mean how could
          you possibly...?
                  (realizing)
          When I was unconscious.  You...
          downloaded... my thoughts, my
          memories, even...
                  (realizing)
          This beach.  I've never been here
          but I remember... it's how I always
          imagined...
                  (softly)
          Pensacola.

                         TED
          We thought this might make things a
          little easier.

And in the blink of an eye they are no longer standing on
a beach but on the rim of the Grand Canyon, looking out at
a spectacular sunset.

                         TED
          ... although this is nice too.

Ellie tries hard to swallow her amazement as Ted begins to
stroll along the rim; she walks with him.

                         ELLIE
          So who -- what -- are you?

                         TED
          Originally just another species like
          yourselves.  Well, not like you at
          all actually, but...

                         ELLIE
          Can you show me?

                         TED
          Small moves, Captain, small moves.

                         ELLIE
          Why did you contact us?

                         TED
          You contacted us.  We were simply
          listening.  We've been listening for
          millions of years.

                         ELLIE
          And those other docking ports I
          saw... I mean... there are others?

                         TED
          Many others.

                         ELLIE
          And they all travel here through
          this wormhole subway system you
          built.

                         TED
          Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit
          system has been in place for
          billions of years; we're just its...
          caretakers.

                         ELLIE
          So who...?

                         TED
          We don't know.  Whoever they were,
          they were gone long before we ever
          got here.

                         ELLIE
          The scale... it's just...
                  (catching her breath)
          So all the civilizations you detect;
          they all end up coming here?

                         TED
          Not all.  Some choose to stay at
          home and dream their dreams.
                  (sadly)
          Some never make it this far.

                         ELLIE
          So we passed some kind of test?

                         TED
          You have your mother's hands...
                  (beat)
          There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't
          sit in judgment.  Think of us more
          as... librarians.  Curators of the
          Universe's rarest and most valuable
          creation...

And now they are walking through a familiar forest.
Sunlight streams through the tall trees.

                         TED
          As many civilizations as we've
          found, compared to the vastness of
          space...

He seems momentarily overcome with a terrible sadness...
and then he recovers, smiles.

                         TED
          ... life is unspeakably rare.  So
          whenever we do find another
          civilization, especially one
          that's... struggling... We send a
          message.  Sometimes we can offer
          help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we
          always try.  Life is simply too
          precious not to.

                         ELLIE
          Can you help us?

Ted hesitates.  They are now standing in the middle of a
vast alien desert, stretching to the horizon.  The dome of
the sky darkens revealing a view from outside the galaxy;
the Milky Way hangs like a pinwheel in the blackness of
intergalactic night.

                         TED
          You're an interesting species; an
          interesting mix.  Capable of such
          exquisite dreams; such horrifying
          nightmares.  Technologically you've
          advanced very quickly -- some think
          too quickly... and yet...

CLOSE ON TED

He turns to Ellie, puts a loving hand to her face.
Softly:

                         TED
          You're so lost.  So cut off... and
          so sad.

And suddenly Ellie is standing on the sun-dappled Cal Tech
campus.  She turns to find herself standing opposite David
Drumlin.

                         DRUMLIN
          What is it that makes you so lonely,
          Miss Arroway?

Ellie stares at him -- instinctively backs away, turning
around --

-- to find herself high atop the radio dish at Arecibo
looking into Peter Valerian's face --

                         PETER
          Be honest, El.  The truth is you
          really don't want the company.

Peter shakes his head -- then begins to melt, morph into
Palmer Joss --

                         JOSS
          What does it feel like to understand
          everything in the universe except
          yourself?

-- the Texas meadow instantly dissolves behind him to
become the darkness of the Hokkaido night --

                         JOSS
          Ellie, there is no reason you have
          to be alone.

Ellie stares at him; he slowly morphs back into Ted as he
and the space around them become infused with an unearthly
golden light; his voice ECHOING and resonating into
infinity --

                         TED
          We are alone.  For millions of years
          we've searched the cosmos... and
          after all the suffering, after all
          the chaos and desolation of the void
          -- the one thing we've found that
          makes the emptiness bearable is each
          other.  That's why I sent the
          message.  That's why I made contact.

Ellie moves closer, staring into his eyes... and catches a
glimpse of infinity.  She holds her breath --

                         ELLIE
                  (whispers)
          Who are you?

We begin to MOVE THROUGH them, INTO --

ANOTHER DIMENSION

                         TED
                  (reading her mind)
          Am I one... or many?

                         ELLIE
          The librarian... or the library...?

We are lost inside an unimaginable realm, an infinity of
nested realities turning inside and within each other in a
staggering visual paradox that dazzles and overwhelms,
that builds and soars until --

-- the soft CRASHING of the SURF...

Ellie is back, standing with her father on a perfect beach
in the glow of twilight.  A gentle breeze blows.  Ellis is
overcome.

                         ELLIE
          ... all those voices... you gather
          them all together.  Millions of
          intelligences in one consciousness...
          and now we're a part of it.

                         TED
          You always have been.  We're all
          descendants of the same stars,
          Ellie.  All made of the same
          primordial atoms.

                         ELLIE
                  (overwhelmed)
          So.  What happens now?

                         TED
          Now... you go home.

                         ELLIE
                  (instinctively; like
                   a child)
          No!
                  (as Ted smiles)
          I mean... why so soon?

                         TED
          If we don't engineer a consistent
          causality it'll work itself out on
          its own, and that's almost always
          worse.
                  (seeing her
                   confusion)
          Ellie, according to your physics
          none of this is possible.  A lot of
          it you're simply not capable of
          understanding, not yet.  No offense.

                         ELLIE
          None taken... but ... do we get to
          come back?  Others of my kind, I
          mean.

He tenderly brushes a stray lock of hair behind her ear.

                         TED
          Eventually you'll get here on your
          own.  This was just the first step;
          in time you'll take another.

                         ELLIE
          But -- other people from our planet
          should see what I've seen -- they
          should witness this for themselves.

                         TED
          That isn't the way it works.

                         ELLIE
          But you said you wanted to help --
          don't you see what it would mean?

                         TED
                  (gently)
          No more stalling, Captain.

                         ELLIE
                  (intensely)
          Please -- if you... downloaded...
          everything about us you know the
          problems we face, the impact it
          could have -- it could make the
          difference --

                         TED
          Ellie... this is the way it's been
          done for billions of years...

She looks at him pleadingly... and as the part of him that
is her father look into his daughter's eyes, he
hesitates --

                         TED
          ... but we'll consider your request.

A breeze blows, stronger now.

                         TED
          It's time to go home now.

                         ELLIE
          No.  Please.

                         TED
                  (smiles sadly)
          Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time
          to grow up.

A WHOOSH of AIR -- Ellie spins around --

The Dodec sits incongruously on the beach.

She turns back.  Ted has vanished.

                         ELLIE
          No...

And as Ellie finally and fully mourns her lost father, we
leave her, crying, alone on an empty beach, 30,000 light
years from home...

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT.  MACHINE (HOKKAIDO) - NIGHT

The HUM DIES as the benzels slowly come to rest.

Ellie emerges from the machine.  Her expression composed.
The opening solidifies behind her --

-- and then we hear a sudden BURST of STATIC, followed by
a cacophonous BARRAGE of VOICES -- Ellie instinctively
puts her hands to her helmet --

                         CONTROLLER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          -- Got her -- !

                         A.T.L.
                  (filtered)
          -- all benzel motion has ceased.
          Repeat, benzels are stopped;
          securing the area --

                         PETER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          Ellie -- are you okay?

                         ELLIE
          I'm -- I'm fine.

                         PETER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          Thank God.  When we lost contact, I
          thought -- we thought... but you're
          okay.  We're still trying to
          determine the nature of the
          malfunction.  Did you notice
          anything at all that --

                         ELLIE
          Wait -- hold on a minute --

                         PETER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          It's all right, the important thing
          is you're safe --

                         ELLIE
          Peter, what are you talking about?
          What malfunction?
                  (looking around)
          What day is this?

                         PETER (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          What day?

                         ELLIE
          How long was I gone?

INT.  COMMAND CONTROL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Peter stands at the command console, just as we left him.

                         PETER
          Ellie... we saw you enter the
          machine.  The benzels spun up,
          generating some sort of atmospheric
          disturbance.  The benzels spun down.
          And then... just now... you stepped
          out.  We were out of radio contact
          exactly... seven minutes and thirty-
          five seconds.  The machine never
          went anywhere.

INT.  MEDICAL BUNKER - IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

A team of physicians examine Ellie, hooked up to various
medical equipment --

                         DOCTOR
          Are you experiencing any flu-like
          symptoms.  Aching joints?  Fever?

                         ELLIE
          I'm fine --

                         DOCTOR
          Headaches?  Swollen glands?

                         ELLIE
          No -- could somebody please just --

The DOCTOR checks a series of monitors, turns to an
official.

                         DOCTOR
          Vitals identical to pre-launch
          stats.

                         ANOTHER SCIENTIST
          No sign of radiation or biological
          contamination of any kind.  She's
          clean.

Peter enters the room, briefly confers with the official
-- then approaches Ellie, who sighs in grateful relief.

                         ELLIE
          Peter... What is going on?  Has
          everyone gone completely insane?

                         PETER
          That's one way of putting it.  Kitz,
          the President, the I.S.C. have shut
          down all official communications;
          there've also been reports of riots
          flaring up across the U.S. and
          Europe.  Until we figure out what
          went wrong things may get rough,
          especially for you --

                         ELLIE
          But the machine worked -- that's
          what I've been trying to tell
          everyone!
                  (in utter
                   frustration)
          The tape -- it's all there, if
          they'd just look at...
                  (seeing Peter's grim
                   look)
          ... the tape...

And as Ellie realizes with sickening certainty --

                                            CUT TO:

STATIC-FILLED MONITOR

Colored snow.  Nothing.


INT.  DEBRIEFING ROOM

Kitz turns off the monitor, turns to Ellie, still in her
hospital gown and robe.  Peter stands nearby, as do a
group of frighteningly expressionless I.S.C. and Pentagon
officials.

                         ELLIE
          ... I don't understand it.  All I
          can think is that maybe because the
          video gear wasn't accounted for in
          the original plans it somehow
          violated the integrity of the
          design.

                         KITZ
          Is that your official response?

                         ELLIE
          I don't have an official response,
          Michael.  All I have are the same
          questions you have.

Kitz pauses... and then he turns to her, his intensity
increasing as we PUSH IN ON him --

                         KITZ
          I'm afraid that's not a satisfactory
          answer, Doctor.  We spent two
          trillion dollars.  You walked into
          that machine with the hopes and
          prayers of an entire planet with
          you, and you stepped out with
          nothing.  Those people are going to
          want more than idle speculation and
          conjecture -- they're going to want
          answers -- and I hope for all our
          sakes you can come up with them.

EXT.  MACHINE (HOKKAIDO) - NIGHT

Ellie, surrounded by a phalanx of security, moves quickly
through the nightmarish mob scene.  Disorienting TV lights
glare, illuminating a flurry of drift snow --

As Ellie is hustled toward a van she glimpses a figure --
an oasis of stillness in the mob, watching her -- Joss.
Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments -- and then
Ellie is swept into the van and away.  Joss watches her go
-- looks at the chaos, the madness around him -- then
slowly looks up to the sky ...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  WASHINGTON D.C.

A hard rain falls.  We FIND a government sedan, FOLLOW it
THROUGH burned-out slums --

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          I have Mr. Kitz for you Ms.
          President.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          Put him through.
                  (as PHONE CLICKS)
          Well?

                         KITZ (V.O.)
                  (filtered)
          Nothing.  Apparently the surface
          began to ossify immediately after
          she emerged; all subsequent attempts
          to re-enter the machine have
          failed...

The sedan approaches the Capitol Building.  The steps are
mobbed with a surreal menagerie of the fanatical and the
dispossessed.  A huge bonfire has been built; images of
Ellie on the cross...

                         KITZ (V.O.)
          ... as have all attempts at internal
          analysis.  We've tried sonargrams,
          magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's
          completely impenetrable.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          Recommendations?

                         KITZ (V.O.)
          I don't know.  Maybe we built the
          damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all
          a hoax...
                  (sighs)
          The safest thing would probably be
          to do a Chernobyl; encase it in
          concrete.

                         PRESIDENT LASKER (V.O.)
          Have your department make a full
          report.

INT.  OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

The rain pours down.  The President slowly hangs up the
phone.

INT.  SEDAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ellie looks out the window at the mob descending on the
car, all fighting desperately to catch a glimpse of her --
faces filled with hope, hate, desperation -- Ellie shrinks
back --

INT.  SENATE ANTEROOM - DAY

The CLOCK TICKING on the wall reads five to nine.

Ellie sits alone in the small room.  Waiting.

A KNOCK on the door.  Ellie looks up nervously --

Palmer Joss stands in the doorway.  A moment... and then
Ellie slowly rises and goes to him.  Embraces him.  He
holds her.

                         JOSS
          Oh, Ellie...

Ellie finally pulling away, wiping her eyes.

                         ELLIE
          Hi.

                         JOSS
          Hi.

                         ELLIE
          I'm assuming you read my deposition.

                         JOSS
          It was quite a page turner.

                         ELLIE
          Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all
          the way to the center of the
          galaxy... Just to find you.

She takes his hand, kisses it.  He touches her face.

The CLOCK TICKS.

                         ELLIE
          So.  I'm assuming they sent you here
          to administer last rites?

                         JOSS
          I'm not sure it's come to that.

                         ELLIE
          They don't believe me.

                         JOSS
          I do.

                         ELLIE
          You're sure you want to?  In the
          universe I saw we're not exactly the
          stars of the show.  What happened to
          me makes us all seem pretty damn
          small.

                         JOSS
          It also makes God enormous.  I think
          of the scope of your universe,
          Ellie... and it takes my breath
          away.  As it will everyone else's.

                         ELLIE
          I don't have any proof, Palmer.

                         JOSS
          Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell
          them your story.  Ultimately they'll
          have no choice but to believe you.

                         ELLIE
          It's not enough, don't you
          understand?  I know it happened --
          but by every standard of science, by
          every standard I've lived my life by
          that fact is utterly beside the
          point.  It may be true but it
          doesn't matter because I can't prove
          it's real.

                         JOSS
          Ellie, the only one holding you to
          that standard is you!  The people
          want to hear your story, they need
          to hear it!

                         ELLIE
          But --

                         JOSS
          Have you seen what's happening out
          there?  The terror, the despair?
          The world is on fire, Ellie.  People
          need something they can believe in,
          something worthy, and you can give
          it to them!

                         ELLIE
          I want to, Palmer -- more than
          anything.  But it has to be real.
          It has to be true.

                         JOSS
                  (hesitates)
          Ellie... if you go out there like
          this -- if you admit to even the
          possibility that what you
          experienced didn't actually happen
          -- I'm afraid they really will
          crucify you.  Please.  For your own
          sake, for the sake of the world...
          tell them what you know to be the
          truth.  Tell them it really
          happened.

Ellie looks up at him -- and then the door opens and an
AIDE enters.

                         AIDE
          They're ready for you.

INT.  U.S. SENATE

Every corner of the cavernous Senate Chamber is jammed
with media, politicians, onlookers.  The world stage.  The
big show.

The International Committee is composed of eight men and
two women, including Kitz.  Occupying the center seat is
the COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, An Asian American Senator in his
sixties.

Sitting all by herself at a long table opposite them,
Ellie looks very small and alone.

                         SENATOR
          You were in the machine for seven
          minutes, thirty-five seconds, is
          that correct, Doctor?

                         ELLIE
          Earth time, yes.

                         SENATOR
                  (pausing)
          Earth time.

                         ELLIE
                  (a deep breath)
          Senator... I believe I traveled
          through a series of wormholes.
          Wormholes are a phenomenon deduced
          by Einstein; they're essentially
          tears in the fabric of space/time.
          Because of the effects of relativity
          what I experienced as a period of
          approximately eighteen hours passed
          almost instantaneously on Earth.  To
          you I seemed to depart and arrive
          back at the same moment.

                         KITZ
          Doctor, isn't it true that wormholes
          are merely predictions of relativity
          theory?  That there's no evidence
          they actually exist?

Ellie hesitates.  Looks up at Joss in the gallery.  Then:

                         ELLIE
          There is no direct evidence, no.

                         KITZ
          And current theory holds that to
          sustain the sort of wormholes you're
          talking about, even for a fraction
          of a second, would require more
          energy than our sun produces in a
          year, is that correct?

                         ELLIE
          I don't have the figures in front of
          me, but yes, that sounds about
          right.

                         KITZ
          In fact, by all the laws of physics
          we know what you claim to have
          experienced is simply impossible.

                         ELLIE
                  (beat, then, softly)
          By our standards... yes.

Palmer Joss, sitting in the gallery, closes his eyes.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The Chairman flips slowly through a file as he questions
Ellie.

                         CHAIRMAN
          ... And this is how the
          extraterrestrial presented himself
          to you?  As your father?

                         ELLIE
          Yes, sir.

                         CHAIRMAN
          He died...
                  (looks at file)
          ... in 1972.

                         ELLIE
          Yes, sir.

                         CHAIRMAN
                  (pausing)
          Dr. Arroway, do you think it's
          possible you had some kind of...
          delusional episode.

Joss leans forward in his chair.

                         ELLIE
          Is it possible...?

                         CHAIRMAN
          All the elements are there.  A
          woman, orphaned young, under a great
          deal of stress.  The failure of a
          project she's staked her self-worth
          and very sense of identity on --
          induces a fantasy of reuniting with
          her 'father in heaven' as it were.
          Is it possible?

Ellie is silent.

                         KITZ
          Please answer the question, Doctor.

                         ELLIE
                  (a long silence)
          Is it possible.  Yes.  But --

                         KITZ
          Thank you, Doctor.  Now --

                         ELLIE
                  (overriding him)
          -- but I don't believe it to be the
          truth.

                         CHAIRMAN
                  (peering at her;
                   intrigued)
          You don't believe it to be... tell
          me something, Doctor.  Why do you
          think they would go to all this
          trouble... bring you tens of
          thousands of light years, and then
          send you home without a shred of
          proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't
          you say?  What was their intent?

                         ELLIE
                  (hesitates)
          I don't know.  Ultimately their
          motives may be as incomprehensible
          as their technology.

The crowd murmurs.  Committee members exchange glances.

                         CHAIRMAN
                  (sigh)
          Dr. Arroway, you come before us with
          no evidence.  No records, no
          artifacts -- only a story that -- to
          put I mildly -- strains credibility.
          Over two trillion dollars was spent,
          hundreds of lives were lost, many
          more may be in jeopardy due to the
          almost incalculable worldwide
          psychological impact... Are you
          going to sit there and tell us that
          we should simply take this all on
          faith?

The word rings out like a shot.  Silence.

                         KITZ
          Answer the question, Doctor.  As a
          scientist -- can you prove any of
          this?

JOSS

Holding his breath.

ELLIE

Closes her eyes.  Finally, almost inaudibly:

                         ELLIE
          No.

The room is silent.  Almost gently:

                         KITZ
          So why don't you admit what by your
          own standards must be the truth:
          that this experience simply didn't
          happen.

                         ELLIE
                  (pauses, then,
                   simply)
          Because I can't.

The crowd reacts.

Ellie looks up to the gallery... and finds Joss.

As she speaks with great emotion and restraint, she seems
to be talking directly to him.

                         ELLIE
          I had... an experience.  I can't
          prove it.  I can't even explain it.
          All I can tell you is that
          everything I know as a human being,
          everything I am -- tells me that it
          was real.

The room grows quiet.

                         ELLIE
                  (softly)
          I was given something wonderful.
          Something that changed me.  A vision
          of the universe that made it
          overwhelmingly clear just how tiny
          and insignificant -- and at the same
          time how rare and precious we all
          are.  A vision... that tells us we
          belong to something greater than
          ourselves... that we're not -- that
          none of us -- is alone.

JOSS

Moved beyond words.

ELLIE

looks lovingly at Palmer... then shifts her gaze to
Michael Kitz.  Softly:

                         ELLIE
          I wish I could share it.  I wish
          everyone, if only for a moment --
          could feel that sense of awe, and
          humility... and hope.  That
          continues to be my wish.

The emotion in her voice compels the room to silence.

Kitz.

Joss.

Ellie.

INT.  CAPITOL BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Spilling out; reporters closing in.  As Kitz emerges he
sees Ellie -- she meets his gaze.

A moment... and then he nods, walks briskly off.  Ellie
turns -- to find Joss standing by the door, waiting for
her.  A timeless moment...

... and then she silently crosses to him and lets him fold
her into his arms.

EXT.  CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT

The rain lashes down unabated.  A sea of press crushing in
on Ellie and Joss as they grimly make their way through,
police clearing the way -- A ZEALOT intones in the b.g. --

                         ZEALOT
          '... He dreamed, and behold, a
          ladder was set up on the Earth, and
          the top of it reached to heaven...
          Surely the Lord is in this place,
          and I knew it not.  This is none
          other but the House of God.'

As Ellie moves through the crowd PEOPLE in wheelchairs
fight to approach, people with terrible deformities --
they call to her:

                         PEOPLE
          Ellie... Bless me, Ellie... Heal
          me...

Ellie, torn between wanting to help these suffering souls
and not wanting to lie, whispers:

                         ELLIE
          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

And then the reporters descend, shouting out questions --
one in particular rings out --

                         REPORTER
          Reverend Joss, do you think the
          failure of the machine is God's
          rebuke to science?

Joss stops.  He turns to the crowd; slowly:

                         JOSS
          As a person of faith... I am bound
          by a different covenant than Dr.
          Arroway -- but I believe our goal is
          one and the same:  the pursuit of
          the truth.  I think today Dr.
          Arroway continued that pursuit under
          the most trying of conditions.

He puts his arm around Ellie and hurries away.  The
crowds, the media watch as the Messiah who failed
disappears into the rainy night.

SERIES OF SHOTS

A)  HOKKAIDO

    The entombment of the machine has begun.  Scaffolding
    on all sides, swarming with workers in quarantine
    suits.  Helicopters fly overhead, dumping load after
    load of concrete.

B)  VLA

    boarded up, deserted.  Weeds springing up around the
    now-rusting cyclone fence; the desert moving in to
    reclaim what it had briefly lost.  The radio dishes
    waiting, silent.

C)  SMALL COUNTRY CEMETERY

    a familiar fishpond in the b.g.  Ellie, holding a
    small bunch of wildflowers, kneels to gently place
    them on her father's grave.

EXT.  LAKE TIMOTHY (OREGON) - DUSK (DECEMBER 31, 2001)

The small figures of Ellie and Joss walk along the
beautiful lake under the forested slopes of Mt. Hood.

                         ELLIE
          ... but it is a good question, and I
          suppose I'll always wonder about the
          answer:  Why would they send me back
          without proof?

                         JOSS
          Maybe what you experienced can't be
          reduced to images on a videotape.
          Maybe they still plan to grant your
          request, only in their own way, in
          their own time... Or maybe it's just
          like you said:  ultimately their
          motives may be as incomprehensible
          as their technology.

                         ELLIE
          In other words, God works in
          mysterious ways...

                         JOSS
                  (smiles)
          In other words.

They stop, look out at the water.

                         ELLIE
          I don't know.  If it was a god, it
          was searching for a greater one.  It
          was still searching for meaning...

                         JOSS
          Does that mean you think it doesn't
          exist?

                         ELLIE
          I'm not sure...
                  (looking up)
          Maybe it simply exists in the search
          for it.  Maybe its something we have
          to make for ourselves.

                         JOSS
          Meaning...

                         ELLIE
          Something my dad -- they -- said.
          'After all the suffering, after all
          the desolation of the void -- the
          one thing that makes the vastness
          tolerable is each other.'
                  (looking up at Joss)
          The one thing that makes it bearable
          is love.

She takes his hand... and then they look up at the sky,
where the first stars are coming out.

                         BBC REPORTER (V.O.)
          ... and while the riots here in
          London continue for the fourth night
          in a row, on the other side of the
          Atlantic the news is equally grim...

                         REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
                  (overlapping)
          ... thousands of starving refugees
          fled the area as the bloody fighting
          continued...

                         REPORTER #2 (V.O.)
          ... a massive book burning took
          place in downtown Berlin today...

                         REPORTER #3 (V.O.)
          ... and on this last night of the
          old millennium and the eve of the
          new one, looking back on a past
          racked by violence and chaos, we of
          the human race look ahead to an
          uncertain future -- a future which,
          at least for now, seems to promise
          only more of the same...

The VOICES FADE into oblivion.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  HOKKAIDO MACHINE - DUSK

The machine stands entombed; silent, inscrutable.

All is still.

Then, the first sign:  small insects crawl from cracks in
the pavement.

A stirring.  A slight breeze.  A subtle HUMMING sound --

A monk stirs in his bed in the nearby monastery; if not
awakened by the strange vibration then by the SHRIEKING
MONKEYS outside.

A vibration.  Something is happening at the core of the
concrete edifice -- it begins to crack --

From inside comes a sound, a terrible, otherworldly
ROAR --

The next transformation has begun.

FROM TWO MILES OUT AT SEA

The island of Hokkaido is shrouded by an ominous
microclimate... a vortex out of which radiates an awful
vibration like the shockwave of a bomb.  A Japanese
fisherman smoking a cigarette on his shrimpboat looks up
in awe.

MACHINE

is lifting, spinning -- dissolving into itself -- leaving
only the vortex of a prodigious wormhole --

DOWNTOWN TOKYO

A thousand neon signs go dark.  New Years revelers look up
in fear.

EXT.  SAN DIEGO ZOO - NIGHT

and the keepers have never known the animals to be so
disturbed.

VIRGINIA SUBURB

Peter Valerian steps out of his front door and stares up
at the sky.  His wife joins him; he silently puts his arm
around her --

WASHINGTON OFFICE

Michael Kitz turns to look out the window at the D.C.
skyline -- fear on his face as he looks down at a picture
of his family, wife and two kids --

BALKANS

Guerrillas look up at the terrifying sky as the GUNFIRE
DIES.

ON SERENGETI

Stampeding wildebeest wheel around seemingly to form a
vast circle.

SOMEWHERE IN PACIFIC

Great swirling pod of dolphin swim in a frenzied circle.

INDIA

A circle of dung beetles in the dust.

EARTH

from Hadden's darkened viewport.  The land obscured by a
rapidly growing cloud that fills the ecosphere.

ELLIE AND JOSS

stand outside a lakeside cabin, transfixed.

A wind picks up.  Grows stronger.

A deep RUMBLING sound, felt more than heard:  a sound too
vast to be any sound at all.  The wind grows stronger.
The LIGHTNING CRACKLES, flushing birds from trees --

And then everything becomes perfectly still -- the
RUMBLING STOPS --

-- a deafening silence -- then --


SOUNDLESS CONCUSSION OF VIOLET LIGHT

high over Times Square -- Kitz's office -- a solitary
farmhouse under the Nebraska sky -- downtown Tokyo -- a
lonely freighter in the middle of the Pacific --
EVERYWHERE --

EXT.  EARTH ORBIT - 250 MILES UP

Looking toward the Earth past the deserted Mir Station --
the brilliant violet flash --

EGYPT

The Valley of the Kings.  The faces of the long dead
Pharaohs bathed in the violet light.

SAHARA

Children stare up in wonder at the same light.

TIME SQUARE/PICCADILLY CIRCUS

People stand frozen in awe.

WASHINGTON D.C.

At the Lincoln Memorial the great man looks down as the
homeless crawl out from their cardboard shelters, bathed
in the brilliant light...

ELLIE AND JOSS

stare up at the sky at an impossible view.

It is the view from the center of the galaxy.  THROUGH the
mouth of the enormous wormhole, we can see the machine
returning to Grand Central Station as a dazzling Aurora
Borealis fills the sky --

VARIOUS SHOTS - ALL OVER THE WORLD

All over the world faces of every race and ethnicity stare
up at a billion blazing multicolored suns lighting up the
heavens, brighter than the brightest day.

The citizens of the Earth look up and wonder as the CHIMES
of MIDNIGHT RING OUT all over the world --

ELLIE

Her eyes filled with tears of wonder and joy, smiles.
She's found what she's been searching for.

                                            CUT TO:

BLACK CARD

                  BRING ON THE MILLENNIUM

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

                          THE END
