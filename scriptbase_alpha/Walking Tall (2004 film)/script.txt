               INTRO

               Inspired by a true story.

               We home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he 
               is carrying a backpack and wearing shades. 
 
               
               EXT. TOWN

               He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general 
               bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left 
               out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing 
               what looks like a drug deal.
 
               EXT. LUMBER YARD

               Chris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls 
               up.
 
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         How ya doin'?

                                     CHRIS
                         Ok. When'd the mill close?

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin 
                         for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, 
                         that's the closest mill work you're 
                         gonna find around here.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         That's too bad.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Nah just simple economics. Y'know we 
                         have a really nice casino here, the 
                         wild cherry. You wanna make some money 
                         maybe you wanna go on down there and 
                         try your luck at the blackjack tables.
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         Nah I don't think so. Thanks.

               Chris turns around and the sheriff notices his name on a bag.
 
               
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         You're Chris Vaughn?

               The sheriff chuckles and steps out of the car.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Well hell, I know all about you Chris. 
                         I know your folks, I'm sheriff Stan 
                         Watkins.
 
               They shake hands.

                                     CHRIS
                         How ya doin.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS

                         give ya a ride up to your folks.

                         Nah I'm fine thank you.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS

                         I'll walk.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Hey it's my pleasure.

                                     CHRIS
                         It's ok.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         I won't take no for an answer (jokingly 
                         reaches for his gun). HEY! Get in the 
                         car.
 
               Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Did I scare ya with that one?

                                     CHRIS

                         You were gone a while huh?

                                     CHRIS
                         8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then.
 
                         
                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months 
                         back he fell asleep at the wheel and 
                         uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man 
                         and a good sheriff.
 
               
               EXT. THE FAMILY HOME

                                     CHRIS
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     SHERIFF WATKINS
                         No problem, and uh Chris (hands him 
                         a piece of paper). It's election month... 
                         I'm your man.
 
               Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward 
               the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed 
               in a police uniform comes out.
 
                                     MICHELLE
                         Can I help you?

               Chris laughs.

                                     MICHELLE
                         Lil' brother.. You come over here and 
                         gimme a hug.
 
               They laugh together.

                                     MICHELLE
                         You look great.

                                     CHRIS
                         What is this?

                                     MICHELLE
                         Hey, I couldn't let you be the only 
                         one looking good in uniform. Hey ma! 
                         Chris is here!
 
                                     CHRIS
                         What's with the tent? (points to a tent 
                         set up on the lawn).
 
                                     MICHELLE
                         Oh, that's for Pete.

                         How ya doin!

               Chris hugs his mother, Connie. A man slowly emerges from the 
               front door.
 
                                     CONNIE
                         How long do we have ya for?

                                     CHRIS
                         For good. I'm home.

                         No.

               They hug again.

                                     CHRIS

                         mill, your letters never mentioned that 
                         it was closed. 
 
                                     CONNIE
                         We didn't wanna bother you with our 
                         problems when your father got laid off.

               We can see from the window that it's raining heavily outside. 
               Chris sets about unpacking his things. Pete comes in looking 
               wet.
 
                                     PETE

               A crappy camper van rolls up. A man steps out.

                         with my life too so uhh I went down 
                         to Seattle, got a guitar and became 
                         all about music. And then pretty soon 
                         I was about music and drugs, n pretty 
                         soon I was basically just about drugs. 
                         Ended up doin 2 years for B+E.

                         supportive and healthy friendships from 
                         my past. Matter of fact I talked to

               A group of guys are there waiting, one of them holding a ball. 
               They salute as Chris walks up. They all laugh.

                         His parents hadn't left him the mill 
                         more than 2 minutes before he shut it 
                         down.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Why?

               a voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from 
               behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle.
 
                                     JAY
                         Cause I opened my Casino.

                         tired of being all that you can be?

               Another truck with a few guys on it pulls up

                                     JAY
                         Not today.

               A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' 
               guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris 
               notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down 
               to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking.
 
               
                                     RAY
                         If we score here we win right?

                                     CHRIS
                         Alright boys, last play. We need to 
                         put this to rest.
 
                                     RAY
                         Just give me the ball.

                                     CHRIS
                         You got it. On the first hut!

                                     JAY
                         Ok Vaughn, last chance.

               Chris gets the ball and throws it. An opponent comes in hard 
               and tackles him low. He collapses. Ray runs for the ball but 
               gets clotheslined by Jay.
 
                                     JAY
                         That's game!

               Chris Helps Ray onto his feet.

               Jay speeds off in his car. Pete rolls up on his bike.

                         that I find most impressive, blends 
                         in with the mountains SO nicely.

                                     CHRIS
                         Bye! No drinking.

               His friends leave, closing the door behind them.

               A screen goes up and a striptease begins. The lady is dressed 
               in the style of a firewoman and has a pole in the center of the 
               stage. She dances around the pole and removes clothes.

                         So you from here or just visiting.

                                     STRIPPER
                         So you've seen all the old faces.

                                     CHRIS
                         Could say that.

                                     STRIPPER
                         Your voice sounds very familiar.

               The lights come on.

                                     STRIPPER
                         Chris...

                                     CHRIS
                         Deni..

               The screen goes down again, Chris leaves the booth.

                         Ok.

                         Five hundred on 6?

                                     JIMMY
                         Yes, I'm in. Boom! Gimme some dice.
 
                         
               Chris notices something odd, he looks concerned.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Lookin' for a 6.

                                     CHRIS
                         Jimmy. Don't roll. Gimme the dice. 
 
                         
                                     CROUPIER
                         Lookin' for a 6. Ohhhhh.

               The dice have landed and it's a 7. Jimmy hangs his head.

                                     CHRIS
                         (To the croupier) You're good, but I 
                         saw it. 
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         Saw what?

                                     CHRIS
                         I saw the switch.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Hey this is a clean game asshole.

                                     CHRIS
                         Yea?

                                     CROUPIER
                         Yea.

                                     CHRIS
                         Let's see about that.

               Chris puts a load of money on the table.

                                     CHRIS
                         Bet you I'll roll a seven.

                                     CROUPIER
                         It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not 
                         your roll. Call security.
 
               Chris has taken the dice. 

                                     CHRIS
                         Put your bets down on the pass line. 
                         These dice are comin up seven.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Chris, why don't we just let it go?
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The 
                         dice are comin up seven.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         It's not your roll sir.

               Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven.

                                     COMMISSIONER
                         No folks, no payout. 

                                     CHRIS
                         (To croupier) Why don't you just take 
                         care of that bet and we're even.
 
                                     CROUPIER
                         Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate 
                         bet, you're not the shooter. It's not 
                         your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.
 
                         
                                     SECURITY GUY
                         Is there a problem?

                                     CHRIS
                         Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. 
                         Does your boss know about this? Just 
                         gimme my money.
 
               The security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him 
               and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting 
               stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Come on, let's go! let's go!

               More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out. A whole 
               fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out. Chris beats off several 
               security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and 
               a baton to the face. Chris wakes up on a table under a light.
 
               
                                     BAD GUY 1
                         (Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special 
                         forces? I'll take that.
 
               Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         What are you doin?

                                     BAD GUY 1
                         (Has a scalpel in his hand) Special 
                         forces... special treatment.
 
               He rips open Chris' shirt.

                                     BAD GUY 2
                         This guy knows Hamilton!

               A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.

               
               EXT. A BRIDGE

               We see Chris is crawling, badly hurt. A truck stops directly 
               in front of him. Chris passes out again.

               A montage ensues with Chris on the couch, sometimes with Ray, 
               other times with Pete. Chris is recovering, and is exercising

                         about the mill. When I was a kid goin 
                         to visit you at work, the smell of that 
                         fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.

                         been pulled. I don't know how my security 
                         cameras didn't catch that.
 
               Jay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris

                         they were a bit edgy. Understandably. 
                         You don't know what kind of assholes 
                         they have to put up with on a daily 
                         basis. Look, they've been reprimanded.

                         guys agree not to press charges. Look

                         to think about it. This is for you.

               The sheriff comes out.

                         They did an internal investigation. 
                         That's good enough for me.

                         term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's 
                         what the casino is. Since the mill closed 
                         down that casino is the main source 
                         of revenue in this town. So, case closed 
                         basically. I'll see ya.

               EXT. OUTSIDE SOME GARAGE

               The Vaughn's truck pulls up at speed. They enter a garage, Pete 
               is on a stretcher.

                         It was close. Crystal Meth.
 
                                     PETE
                         I'm sorry. I never did it before.

                                     KID
                         It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him 
                         into it. 
 
               Chris approaches the kid.

                                     CHRIS
                         Where'd you get the drugs?

                                     KID
                         I'm not really sure...

                                     CHRIS
                         Stop. Where?

                                     KID
                         From the security guys workin at the 
                         casino.
 
               Chris gets into his truck.

                                     CONNIE
                         Chris, wait. Call the police.

                                     CHRIS
                         No, that won't do any good.

               Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage.
 
               
                                     DAD
                         Is Pete ok?

                                     CHRIS
                         He'll be fine.

               Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard.

                                     DAD
                         What are you doin?

               Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it.

                                     DAD
                         Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen 
                         to me. If you go outta here with that 
                         gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!
 
                         
               Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides 
               to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from 
               the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes 
               a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight 
               scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally 
               trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from 
               the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the 
               VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind 
               it.
 
                                     JAY
                         Guess that changes our relationship 
                         a bit huh?
 
               Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear 
               with sirens going. He pulls over.

                         I advise you to give this offer more 
                         than a little serious thought. If you 
                         go to trial you stand to do 18 years. 
                         This is a sweet plea, normally they 
                         wouldn't even put it on the table but 
                         your military record can't be ignored. 
                         Three months home arrest, some community 
                         service. Pretty generous offer Chris.

                         was no chance of that. Me and my men 
                         we were just tryin to control him. He 
                         was highly trained, violent, very dangerous 
                         person.

                         trained that he despatched six of the 
                         casino staff single handedly. His weapon 
                         of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which 
                         in his hand became a devastating force 
                         with one aim, to hurt people, destroy 
                         property.

                         on a mission. Besides, he seemed to 
                         be too busy enjoying himself from what 
                         I could see.

                         What's the problem sheriff?

                                     CHRIS
                         You. And the drugs you're pedalling 
                         out of your casino.
 
                                     JAY
                         Oh. Only thing that's going on in my 
                         casino right now is reconstruction. 
                         You took care of that. 
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Yea that's right and I plan on taking 
                         care of everything else too.

                         If you can, try to think this through. 
                         A casino is a license to print money. 
                         Why would I jeopardise that by selling 
                         drugs?
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Cause you owned the town Jay. It's changed 
                         now.
 
                                     JAY
                         Really? See the only thing that I think 
                         has changed around here is that every 
                         morning you get to wake up and put on 
                         that nifty lil badge. But underneath 
                         that badge is the same guy that couldn't 
                         make it playing college football, apparently 
                         couldn't make it in the army and not 
                         gonna make it as a cop.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Is that right?

                                     JAY
                         Yea, and if you push too hard you're 
                         gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 
                         40. License please.
 
               Chris hands it over.

                         What's wrong with my tail lights?

               Chris smashes up the back end of Jay's car with his trusty piece

                         this to happen.
 
               One of the men outside has a canister. Watkins gives him the 
               nod and he begins walking towards the station. Chris is beneath 
               the floor and shoots him in the legs. The two remaining men outside 
               open fire again. Another gunman tries to approach but he's shot 
               in the legs as well. Watkins enters the station and fires repeatedly 
               at the floor.

               Chris appears in the floor hole and blasts Watkins at close range 
               with a shotgun.

               Chris and Ray hold up their hands. He aims at Ray but he's shot 
               in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs.

               Chris is in a police car driving at speed. He approaches the 
               mill and busts through the locked gates. 
 
               
               INT. THE MILL

               The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch. 
               He finds Jay sitting.
 
                                     JAY
                         Hey Chris.

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up Jay.

                                     JAY
                         Just a sec. Remember we used to play 
                         hide n seek up here?
 
               Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound.
 
               
                                     JAY
                         That was my favourite sound. 

                                     CHRIS
                         Get up!

               Jay stands up and holds up his hands.

                                     JAY
                         Look... Chris... just...

               Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch. Chris falls 
               into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over 
               it.
 
               Jay hits more switches, powering up the machinery.

                                     JAY
                         You wanna know what my new favourite 
                         sound's gonna be? The sound of you screaming 
                         like a little bitch.
 
               Jay hits Chris in the stomach with a pole a few times. Chris 
               grabs the pole and they both fall. Chris has hurt his leg. Chris 
               stumbles off into the woods. Jay grabs an axe and goes after 
               him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large 
               earthy embankment. At the bottom they come to their senses and 
               begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's 
               ripped off a tree. Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in 
               the legs.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         You're right Jay, this does change our 
                         relationship. This is my town, you're
