Gene Watson is a public accountant who arrives on a train at Union Station in Los Angeles, accompanied by his 6-year-old daughter Lynn.
Because of his ordinary looks, he is approached by a pair of sinister people named Smith and Jones.
Pretending to be cops, Smith and Jones kidnap Lynn and confront Gene with a simple choice -- kill California governor Eleanor Grant in 90 minutes or less, or Lynn will die.
Watson is given a gun, six bullets, and a name tag, and he is told to go to the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and kill Eleanor, who is giving an afternoon speech.
While Jones is watching Lynn in a van, Smith watches Watson in order to prevent Watson from alerting the authorities.
Watson must quickly find some way to get himself and Lynn out of this seemingly impossible situation.
