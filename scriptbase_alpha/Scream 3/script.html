<b>EHREN KRUGER
</b>
2nd DRAFT - REVISED

<b>MAY 2, 1999
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
A big dramatic crescendo as we --

<b>								OPEN ON:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL
</b>
Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to 
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly 
<b>DISSOLVE INTO:
</b>
<b>INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT
</b>
A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot 
teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in 
his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city 
of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated 
argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

<b>				 BEN
</b>				(into cell)
			God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
			I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
			Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
			a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
			I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
			in all your squandering the best you can do for me is
			A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
			It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
			offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
			worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
			you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should 
			fire you and go to ICM.

<b>				CATHY(O.S.)
</b>			   (off phone)
			Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad 
			mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
			famous as you are today. The least you can do is
			show me a little god damn respect.

<b>				BEN
</b>			   (into phone)
			You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
			FUCK YOU! You're fired.
			   (Ben hangs up)
			Unfucking believable.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares 
uncomfortably.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. 
			Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
<b>			JASON DOES BROADWAY?
</b>
Ben's phone rings. He answers it.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			   (into phone)
			What's up, B.D. with the B.D.

<b>				WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>			   (off phone)
			Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Christine?

<b>				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>			No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
			Of course it's me, silly.
			And I feel like an ass standing
			in this theater lobby all by myself.
			Where are you babe, the movie starts
			in twenty minutes.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
			there was some big accident. It could be
			a little while so I don't want you to start
			freaking if I don't get there at exactly,
				(checks watch)
			Eight thirty.

<b>				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>			All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
			p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

<b>				BEN
</b>			   (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
			Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
			I bet you did such a great job.

<b>				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>			I did. Hon, although I got a total of
			six minutes screen time, they're the
			best six minutes of the movie.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
			Look, my battery's dying . . .
<b>		
</b>But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the 
conversation short.

<b>				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>			Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

Ben smiles.

<b>				BEN
</b>			 Sure thing.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the 
windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going 
anywhere.

<b>CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
</b>
Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

<b>CLOSE ON CARD -
</b>
A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to 
life in his hand.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (startled)
			Jesus.
			  (answers call)
			Hello?
<b>	
</b><b>				VOICE
</b>			Hello.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Who is this?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Who is this?

	At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish 	
	deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two	
	films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.


<b>				BEN
</b>			Well what number are you trying to reach?

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			 I don't know.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			Do I?

<b>				 BEN
</b>			  (peeved)
			Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
			Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (angrily)
			Asshole, Can't talk.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			But your voice sounds so familiar.

Ben smiles.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Does it now?


<b>				VOICE
</b>You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben 
Damon.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			   (smiling profusely)
			Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			Really? You're such a talented actor.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (loves the praise)
			Thanks.

<b>			 VOICE
</b>			Now let's see you act your way out of this one.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if 
you will.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			What do you mean?

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES 
			ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend 
			Christine is in there.  She's all alone. 
			Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film 
			to start.
			   (laughs coldly)
			I've got my knife.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the 
PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			 (turning pale)
			Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			More of a game really. 

<b>				 BEN
</b>			What kind of a game?

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
			Here's how we play. I ask you a question. 
			You get it right, your girlfriend lives. 
			You answer wrong, she dies.

<b>				 BEN
</b>			I swear to God if you lay a finger on her 
			I'll fucking kill you!

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. 
			First question, Your girlfriend's counting on 
			you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have 
paid attention to Christine he might have known this.


<b>				 VOICE
</b>			Come on. Don't you know?
<b>		
</b>
<b>				 BEN
</b>				  (hesitating)
			It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character 
			she plays in the movie!

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. 

<b>				BEN
</b>			What?! But I did everything you said to do!

<b>				VOICE
</b>			That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're 
			taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me 
			beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. 
			I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

<b>				BEN
</b>			What?!

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Good bye Ben.
<b>	
</b>Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and 
then . . .

<b>				RECORDED MESSAGE
</b>			   (off phone)
			Due to the high volume of calls this evening,
			Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
			not a real emergency please call another dep-

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			You're not playing by the rules Ben.
			Don't you want her to live?

<b>				 BEN
</b>			I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

<b>				 VOICE
</b>			No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
			you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
			Do you understand? 

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV 
into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car 
screeches down the off ramp.

<b>								 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</b>
Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. 
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the 
awaiting b.g.

<b>								 CUT TO:
</b>

<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
</b>
The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps 
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing 
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into 
his SUV, gets an idea.

<b>THE BACK --
</b>
--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not 
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE 
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 

<b>				BEN
</b>			   (to himself)
			Thank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards 
the sign when suddenly --

<b>HIS CELL RINGS.
</b>
Ben answers the call.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (into phone)
			Yeah.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Very good. You follow directions well.
			Now for the final part of the game.
			Put down the bat and approach the sign,
			slowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the 
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (into phone)
			Where are you?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Closer than you think.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
			from me?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			To see your reaction.

<b>				BEN
</b>			Reaction to what?

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a 
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs 
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.


<b>				BEN
</b><b>			OHMYGOD! NO!
</b><b>			CHRISTINE --
</b>
Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in 
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the 
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, 
not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal 
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, 
face to face with his attacker.

<b>				BEN
</b>			  (screaming)
<b>			BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
</b><b>		
</b><b>				THE GHOST
</b>			You just lost the role Ben.
			Consider this your parting gift.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, 
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	TITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"
</b>
<b>									OPEN ON:
</b>
<b>	EXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
</b>
GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the 
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for 
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

<b>				 GALE
</b>			Good morning Hollywood. And today
			officially starts the Summer movie
			season. Opening the box office this
			week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
			in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy
			and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
			and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
			in STAB 2, based off my best selling
			book the WINDSOR MURDERS. 

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea 
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

<b>				 GALE
</b>			Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
			to the occasion. Today we have director of the
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
			Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
			welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
<b>	
</b>The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, 
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy 
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee 
mug beside Gale's hand.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

<b>				GALE
</b>			It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			   (addressing audience)
			Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
			many fans of the genre. And I must say
			that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
			or Tori or David not returning to complete
			the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
			here. Aided with my excellent cast of
			newcomers I believe we're going to pull
			off one of the best Stabs yet.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
			seems that way.
				(a beat)
			Honestly though, 
				(smiles) 
			tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			  (a long pause)
			Honestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this 
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Your life?

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with 
			those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like 
			I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick 
			your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to 
			a Tobe Hooper flick.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into 
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second 
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of 
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her 
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as 
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign 
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing 
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to 
Roman.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Would you excuse me for a moment?

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			  (smiling)
			Sure.

Gale bolts for --

<b>INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
</b>
Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He 
grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

<b>				GALE	
</b>			Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.

</b><b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to 
			introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
			  (flashes badge)
			Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, 
			or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.
			He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the 
			second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part 
			in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Both of them were found brutally murdered this 
			morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy 
			reports having come back to me yet but the 
			bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.  

<b>				GALE
</b>			So is that why you're here? Is that why you're 
			holding me from my show, to tell me about some 
			brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but 
			there's more. The killer left a note.

<b>				GALE
</b>			A note?

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping 
in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND 
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother 
Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

<b>				GALE(O.S.)
</b>			That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
</b>			There's more.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across 
the back "SIDNEY".

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
			but she's keeping herself very well hidden.
			You're my one and only hope in finding her.
			Her life may be in grave danger.

<b>				GALE
</b>			I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
			sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
			I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
			she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
			person that might know is, 
			  (gale hesitates), 
			not going to talk.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			And who would that be?

<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY
</b>
A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY 
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 
<b>. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.
</b>
All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey 
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY
</b>
A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane 
hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another 
corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In 
other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the 
Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy 
of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and 
they exchange greetings.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Hey Dew, did you hear?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			No, what?

<b>				TOM
</b>			Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
			making movies in the hills, the next day 
			you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a 
clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample 
cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 
playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark 
hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the 
production.

<b>				 SARAH
</b>			Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with
			these re-writes. It's like every five
			minutes there's a new script. God, and
			you just know this all because of STAB 2's
			script winding up on the internet two months
			after it wrapped shooting.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			And still the film is Number One at the box
			office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
			and Arlington Street.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			Nah I think it's doing so damn well because
			one of it's players got iced. I just hope
			none of us end up dead.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.
			God Ben Damon was such a hottie.

<b>				TYSON
</b>				 (sighs)
			And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
			but I'm really concerned about my safety 
			now.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			What are you talking about?
			The murders were a completely isolated
			incident.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			(reading from script)
<b>			SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
</b>			"What are you talking about Ricky, the
			murders were a completely isolated incident".

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Would you give that script a rest?	
			It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			I'm just saying, though. What if there's
			someone out there stalking actors? Huh?
			Then what?

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			There's always someone out there stalking
			actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			Melinda McGraw?

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			No, the other one. The one who played his
			wife. 

<b>				SARAH
</b>			I know who you're talking about. Rebecca
			something.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.
			Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
			too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
			Jody Foster, --

<b>				TYSON
</b>			Listen Miss ingénue, your cheering me up to much,
			Give it a break.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm 
around her. She shoves him away.

<b>				TOM
</b>			What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
			I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
			Jeez.
			   (lights up a smoke)
			So what are you doing tonight?

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Talk about moody.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with 
bedroom eyes.

<b>				TOM
</b>			And how about you good looking?
			Got any plans for later?

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
			with that doesn't look like you.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at 
Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

<b>				TYSON
</b>			Oh no. I ain't into that shit.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

</b>
<b>DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.
</b>
They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

<b>				 GALE
</b>			Déjr vu-do.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher 
Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat 
on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY 
dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

<b>				 VOICE(O.S.)
</b>			Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
			comes running. What a shock.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.
			I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's
			Events?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Yeah. A real tragedy.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the 
two.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, 
			this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What so you can just exploit her again with another
			book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (to Kincaid)
			Show him.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of 
			Ben and his girlfriend.

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly 
growing.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
			I promised her nobody would ever find her.
			If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
			approach her with this on my own and see
			what she'd like to do about it.

Kincaid nods.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else
			should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Understood.
			  (a beat)
			If you'll excuse me Detective.
			  (coldly)
			Gale.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I'm going to have a little chat with the
			producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice 
<b>O.S.
</b>
<b>				WOMAN(O.S.)
</b>			GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, 
rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon 
green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on 
her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't 
really want to be in her company very long.

				Gale
			Shit.

				Jennifer
			Listen, I know we've never met, and 
			I don't mind you never returning my calls, 
			but I have to tell you that after two films 
			I feel like I am in your mind.

				Gale
			Well, that would explain my constant headaches.  

				Jennifer
			  (defensively)
			You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' 
			that's a pretty good fall back.

				Gale
			Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty 
			good fall back.

				Jennifer
			Gives me more time for my work.  
			After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex 
			character.

				Gale
			And to be played by an actress with such 
			depth and range.  

Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.

				Dewey
			No answer at Sid's. Where'd 
			the Detective go?

<b>	
</b><b>				JENNIFER
</b>			   (excitedly)
<b>			DEWEY!
</b><b>	
</b>Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.

				Jennifer 
			  (fondles Dewey's butt)
			Gale, I think you'll really appreciate 
			my character work in this one, someone's 
			helped me understand the real you.

				Gale
			Someone?

				Jennifer
			The ruthless ambition, your private 
			self-loathing, and that lost and lonely 
			little girl inside.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Jennifer
			You heard me. 
			  (takes Dewey's cellular) 
			Thanks Dewey.  I'll return it.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Dewey
			Little girl inside.

				Gale
			I thought you were supposed to be in 
			Woodsboro!

				Dewey
			Well, I'm surprised you thought about me 
			at all.  Listen I gotta get back to 
			trying to get hold of Sid.
			Besides, she's more important than you ever were.

				Gale
			Wait! Dewey we can work on this together!
			As a team! Like in the past!

				Dewey
			No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this
			time I'd like to catch the killer before 
			the body count gets any higher.
			  (a beat)
			Toodles.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two 
producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man 
with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy 
fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, 
ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their 
conversation.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			I can assure you that security on the set
			will be at an all time high. Again, the
			deaths are sheer tragedy.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.
				(laughs)
			I myself am a big STAB fan.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			Really?
				(smiles)
			Have you ever thought about acting?
			You've got just the right face.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I am kind of dedicated to my job.
			Although I do enjoy taking acting
 			classes on my weekends. I grew up
			around these studios anyway. I know
			my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter
			for PARAMOUNT.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Really, what was his name?

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Excuse me Detective, I think we have some
			business to attend to.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			   (flabbergasted)
			GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here?
			No press on the set!
			   (to security)
			No press, no press on set!
			Get that woman out of here.

<b>				SECURITY GAURD
</b>			  (approaching)
			Yes, Mr. Milton.
<b>			
</b><b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.

Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh come on! Why the hostility?

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and 
			all but last month I happened to catch 
			your little segment on me and how my wife 
			left me because I'm a sex addict who 
			enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. 
			It was a real eye opener my lawyers are 
			still thinking about bringing to your 
			superior's attentions.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (shit-eating smile on her face)
			They're the ones who approved it.

Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at 
Kincaid.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Alright Kincaid, no where to?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I go to the police station and do my job,
			and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, 
			give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Shit. Can I even get a ride home?

conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's 
wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips 
are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. 
She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --

MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the 
window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>				(crying)
			   Mom!

Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The 
streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through 
the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --

THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. 
SIDNEY screams --

Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY

A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is

No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH 
and the killer inside!

Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for 
Sunrise Studios drags out.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			Shit.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work 
boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the 
ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the 
next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop 
weapons.

<b>THE GHOST --
</b>
Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to 
chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto 
the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

<b>				SARAH
</b>			  (screaming)
			No! No! Noooo!

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a 
final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs 
her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out 
her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm 
resonates in the b.g. The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen.

A NICE PSYCHO-ESQUE close up of the dead Sarah's eye as Blood swirls into the 
pupil.

</b>			Shit. Sarah Darling.

			I interviewed her too.
			God, it's happening again isn't it

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Yes well we have a suspect, so don't

Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Who?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			I'm not at liberty to tell you that
			Miss Weathers. You're no longer working
			with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why
			you're standing in here right now. By

<b>				GALE
</b>			But you won't. You're a good man detective.
			We think alike. I know you need my help.
			And I know you know I need your help.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			In my fifteen years as a homicide detective

<b>				GALE
</b>			Please, call me Gale.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his 
late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his

			Or at least call her home.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified

			This is police work, not Pulitzer material.

</b>			Hey, fuck off.

</b>			No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			That's because I didn't.

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			What meeting?

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah
			and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate 
			answered the phone, says it was you.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told 
			her to go   anywhere!

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.  

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did 
			not call   Sarah Darling!  

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Sarah Darling said you did.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Someone is trying to ruin my movie.  
			Someone wants to kill   my movie!

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll 
			be something interesting to put on the 
			director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			  (dry laugh)
			 Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.
			 Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?
			 They're actually shelving my film because there's

</b>			Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one  
			about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or 
			not it looks like we're going to have to  go 
			back into our past.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid.
			This has nothing to do with you Gale.

<b>				GALE
</b>			This has everything to do with me Dewey.
			I was the one who brought the nation's  
			attention to this shit anyway. I'll be  
			damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass  
			on the buck again.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Do you really mean it this time Gale?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Yes. Look, let's get something straight  
			Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police  
			came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to  
			make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Why would the police come to you?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Again, I am the author of the definitive book on 
			the Woodsboro murders.!
			  (a beat)
			What about you?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What about me?

<b>				GALE
</b>			You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only 
			place that's real!'  But now you're here.  
			Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited 
			until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, 
			it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is 
			like seven everywhere else.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a 
			month? L.A Forever?

<b>				GALE
</b>			It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I
			could've been the next Diane Sawyer!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?  
			I liked her! 

<b>				GALE
</b>			It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			You used to say that was our strength.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Dewey, you're not just here because of  
			that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video 
			version of me, are you? 

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not 
			About you.

<b>				GALE
</b>			All of what Dewey?  You do know something, 
			don't you?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Off the record.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Always.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a
			woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to 
			see the file on Sid, for research.

<b>				GALE
</b>			And?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.  
			A month later, the station gets broken into, 
			the file room ransacked.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Someone stole Sid's file?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			I already removed it.  I think someone on the 
			film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only 
			reason I came here. To make do a little 
			private investigating of my own and make sure no 
			one here was planning anything.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (whips out cellular)
			I'm sorry, this is too good!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Right. Sorry.
			  (a beat)
			Do you think he did it?
<b>			  (RE: ROMAN)
</b>
<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (his beeper goes off)
			I've got my suspicions but still, 
			nothing  you say can ever make me take 
			my eyes off one person.

<b>				GALE
</b>			And who is that?

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and 
years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Jennifer needs me.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			I'm on duty.

Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace 
has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway

			Stop following me.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			You're not a detective.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Neither are you, Magnum P.I.

<b>				DEWEY

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to 
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY 
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
			That's a shocker.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
			last month. The one where you said my car
			accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
			and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my

<b>				GALE
</b>			Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
			Stage the news to boost ratings.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Really, cause that stunt lost me the

Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.

Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees 
Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her 
make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

<b>				GALE
</b>			Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? 
			What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those 
			USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly 
			you suck at acting?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			God damn you Gale Weathers! 
			Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his 
			victims as they die in the script!
			Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
			So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so 
			his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's 
			Candy, and now me!

<b>				GALE
</b>			Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!
			Number one there were five different 
			versions of the script given out.
			Ben Damon was given a fake script because 
			he was only being offered the role.
			It only had fragments of real scenes from the 
			actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's 
hands.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (reading script)
<b>			AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!
</b>			This is complete bullshit.
			Who wrote this piece of crap?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			I know right. It was kinda weak.
			That's cause Will Kennison only wrote 
			a rough treatment of it.
			The script was written by some new guy. 
			He wrote Arlington Street.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Still that was a much better movie,
			I saw it at the premiere last week.
			God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked 
			with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			  (crying)
			What are you talking about?
			Because of this shit I'll probably never 
			act in a Hollywood film again.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

<b>				TOM
</b>			Hey good looking, if you play your cards right, 
			I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch 
			and try you out for a few films my  production 
			company is working on.
			  (a beat)
			How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans,

			Damn it. There goes my chances of getting

 Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the 
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom

 Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet 
is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

<b>  THE GHOST --
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>			You fucker!

 The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The 
ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to 
lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom 
gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  
trickle of blood down his lips.

<b>				TOM
</b>			  (gagging)
			Fucker!

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the 
closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST 
steps back, admiring his work.

			 No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

</b>			What about her?

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the 
front door.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
			I'll get it.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			What if it's the killer?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh use your brain drama queen!
			Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? 
			Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in 
			some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or 
			Chucky? Huh?

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked 
away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer 
huddle together, follow close behind.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Do you smell something?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (smirking)
			It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. 
Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, 
turns it when suddenly --

<b>THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!
</b>

</b>			Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.

Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A

</b>			Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading 
outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

</b>			Who's phone?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Oh shit it's my cell!

<b>				GHOST(O.S.)
</b>			I just might!

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer 
screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up 
his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey 
backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!
			He's dead!

<b>				GALE
</b>			No! He's not dead! He's still breathing!
			Look!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out

Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door. A noise O.S. Dewey pauses, turns 
around --

<b>THE GHOST IS GONE.

Dewey looks to the patio door.

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back, 
kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through 
the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the 
hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her. 
Helps her up.

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a 
trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell

DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale 
sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously 
been drenched).

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Whoever it is, now is taking credit 
			for Maureen Prescott's murder. 

<b>				GALE
</b>			But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, 
			Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they 
			even told Sidney how they did it!  

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in 
			your book that Sidney got it wrong before.  
			She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, 
			and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a 
			third killer.  Sidney Might know something 

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  
			And even if there was a third killer, 
			Sidney doesn't know about it.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,
			she is a key element in this case.  I have a press 
conference 
			in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead 
			celebrities.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Four? There are five.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.
			Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned 
			how to count.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Police are still searching through the debris.
			Could be days before we find her . . . that is,
			if she's even there.

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever 
so nefariously at Dewey.

<b>				GALE
</b>			OK, look.  We all know that this has something to 
			do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the 
			killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Actually, there was more this time.
			This time, we found a picture too.

<b>				DEWEY/GALE
</b>			  (together)
			What?

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it 
over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Before you jump to conclusions, the man in 
			the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country 
			on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's
			got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's
			supposedly the biggest thing down under since
			Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What does this have to do with Sid?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her
			own daughter?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he 
			was married to Maureen.

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			   (chiming in)
			What's your problem?  Last night you were almost

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			When it's a threat, you'll know it.

</b>			Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers

			Hi, you've reached the machine. Leave a message,

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Sid it's me, this is the sixth time I've called.
			  (Sid turns the corner, is ushered down the hall by a cop)
			Please pick up, I wanna make sure you're Okay.
			  (Dewey notices Sidney approaching him)
			Sid!

<b>				SIDNEY
</b><b>			DEWEY!
</b>
The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What are you doing here? I told you to
			stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Well it's not safe for me up there either.
			The killer found me Dewey. He called me
			last night.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			What?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up
			here with the people I care about.
			   (a beat)
			Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is
			talking about? I found this place from a
			FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.

</b>			What Rielly?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			There's someone here who wants to help.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.

<b>				SIDNEY 
</b>			Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.

For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Thank you.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Sid, this is detective Kincaid.  

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. 

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			The killer called her.  

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			What?  When?

<b>				GALE
</b>			What'd he say?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Oh, you know, the usual small talk, 
			"What's new, how ya been, how do you want 
			to die?"  

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've 
			gotten your number?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.  
			Did you call her from the set?  

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			No.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Do you have her number stored in your memory?
			  (Dewey thinks)
			Phone memory!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Has anyone else every used your phone?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Just Jennifer.  
			   (To Kincaid_) 
			And you.  


<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.

Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each
			murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo
			of your mother. 

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.  
			Why didn't you say something?

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			I was afraid they were bait, something to, 
			ya know,  trick you out of hiding.  

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio
			where all this shit's going down.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Are you sure?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Absolutely.

KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out 
of Dewey's truck.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3

			Darling was murdered last night.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Mm, what a waste of Silicone.

			What does my mother have to do with this 
			all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.

A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, 
scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up.

This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape 
marked SCARY MOVIES 101.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!
			What are you doing here?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Who's this.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.

<b>				KAREN

			That's me. First and Last. 

Sidney hugs Karen. So does Dewey.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			It's been a while? You still working 
			at Bradley's?

<b>				KAREN
</b>			Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video

			Anyway, I'm here because I heard on the

<b>INT. TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b>
Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, 
cramped trailer watching the tape. 

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			 Oh MY god.

<b>				RANDY
</b>			Well, if you're watching this tape, it means 
			as I feared, I did not survive these killings 
			here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason 
			I am here is to help you, so that my death 
			will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will 
			help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  
			If this killer does come back, and he's for real, 
			there are a few things that you gotta remember.  
			Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same 
			rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you 
			find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, 
			and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel 
			rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing 
			with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding 
			chapter of a trilogy.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			A trilogy?


<b>				RANDY
</b>			That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, 
			but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned 
			with, because true trilogies are all about going back 
			to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't 
			true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed 
			something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So 
			if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some 
			super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be 
			super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him 
			won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta 
			cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him 
			up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can 
			die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final 
			chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the 
			time this thing is through.  Number three; the past 
			will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you 
			think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is 
			not at rest, any sins you think were committed in 
			the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER 
			FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off 
			by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us 
			anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, 
			you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your 
			back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, 
			and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules 
			say, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not 
			if you're watching this tape.

BIANCA BERNADETTE, an aging, former actress in her late forties, early

Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at 
Gale and Jennifer.

<b>				BIANCA
</b>			Can I help you?

<b>				GALE
</b>			I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro 
			and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman 
			for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

Bianca shakes her head "no".

<b>				BIANCA
</b>			I don't watch TV and I hate books.
			Whatta you need?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

<b>				BIANCA
</b>			Nope.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (groans)
			Well can you tell me if the woman in this 
			picture looks familiar to you.

Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's 
desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused.

<b>				BIANCA
</b>			Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those 
			files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

<b>				GALE
</b>			Well if you won't work for me, will you work 
			for the president?

Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, 
slides the money back.

<b>				BIANCA
</b>			The president . . . of the studio.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?

Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the 
desk. It's absolutely stunning.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy.
			  (to Gale)
			My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story.

How can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger.

bathroom.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			H-hello? Anyone there?

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She 
flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls 
for feet.
What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard 
when she sees --

Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly --

<b>				MAN(O.S.)

This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to 
make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly --

WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits 
the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the 
killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on 
her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging 
out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in 
her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney 
slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the 
first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, 
burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a 
tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, 
she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair 
of attackers come back for more.

runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other 
side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off 
running for WALLACE and DEWEY.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			But you know who she was.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd 
			known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.  
			I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?  

<b>				GALE
</b>			And now? I mean, murders on your set and 
			still you say nothing?

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Get real, that would make me a suspect!

<b>				GALE
</b>			Just because you knew her?

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Yeah.

<b>				GALE
</b>			I don't think so!  Just what happened to 
			Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.  
			It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller 
			out behind the barn and shot him in the head a 
			long time ago.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug
			up and drug all over National TV? Why don't
			you start talking.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			It was in the 70's, everything was different.  
			I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.  
			It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get 
			them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing 
			happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or 
			another, no matter what she said afterwards.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Are you saying she was-

<b>				MILTON
</b>			I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they 
			did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth 
			is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges 
			were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds 
			wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in 
			Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.

			  (a beat)
				Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my 
			mother for the first time. You know, with TV and 
			those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel 
			like I'm just learning about myself for the first 
			time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			  (a long beat)
			Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. 
			That's good news.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			How is that good news?

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, 
			flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle 
			guys like that.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Oh yeah, how?  

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Catch him, or kill him. 

Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, 
jacket, etc.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?


Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes 
glaring right into hers.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			  (sotto)
			My life.

Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then --

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Mine too.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b> INT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET
</b>
Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for 
the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears. 

<b>CLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET.
</b>
The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. 
Jennifer is gagging.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Oh God Gale, Dewey was right.
			Stop getting so nervous and you
			might stop causing me to gag!

<b>				DEWEY/GALE
</b>			  (together)
<b>			SHUT UP!
</b>
Jennifer's quiet.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			I think Milton's the killer.
			I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

<b>				 GALE
</b>			Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.
			 He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack
			-off parties he has with his two best friends.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			 Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (smacks her forehead out of frustration)
			Do you get any of my witty humor?
			I mean, you did play me for three movies.
			  (a beat)
			His two hands, dingus.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Ssh ladies.

Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out. 
The three disappear inside it.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along 
the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S.

IT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			  (into phone)
			John Milton.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Wanna play a game?

<b>				MILTON
</b>			Who is this?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me.

<b>				MILTON
</b>			 It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie!
			  (a beat)
			 I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and 
			have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of 
			shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the 
			lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was 
			besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John 
			Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll
			be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up 
			from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed 
			by John Sayles.

Milton's going rapid fire.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. 
			Well, at least not for you.


THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, 
John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. 
A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

<b>THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.
</b>
<b> CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  MILTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open. It won't budge. 
Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand. He shines the light down on the 
lock.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh Dewey I'm sorry.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up, 
rubs his head.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Here. Let me --

JENNIFER, chimes in. Clearly annoyed.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Excuse me Gale! What the hell   
			do you think you're doing?

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it 
almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (shaking it off)
			Let's get this drawer open.
			If it's locked, there must be something  
			inside he's trying to hide.

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked 
drawer. The lock's smashed off.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey 
shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			What? What'd you find?

Gale's eyes widen.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never 
			going to believe who Milton's kid is. 

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Who is it?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			  (nervously)
			Guys! I got a bad feeling.

<b>				DEWEY/GALE
</b>			  (angrily, together)
<b>			NOT NOW!
</b>
<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Huh?

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST 
jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops 
to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer 
wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (frantic)
			Gale run!

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of 
the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (screaming)
			Dewey!

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale 
screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer 
sending him flying onto his back.

<b>  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT
</b>
Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of 
them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens 
with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

<b>MILTON --
</b>
--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to 
gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. 

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, 
giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale 
races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked 
"stairs". She bolts through the door. 

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  STAIRWELL - OFFICES - NIGHT
</b>
Gale races down the stairs, nearly tripping and falling. She races out onto 
the ground floor.

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.

KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Jesus Gale what happened?

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (frantic)
			He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!
			  (realizing)
			DEWEY! Dewey's in there too!
			He needs medical help!
			He's hurt!

<b>				DETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>			Alright, calm down. I'm going  
			to radio in for backup right now.

<b>				VOICE(O.S.)
</b>			Not so fast. We're not finished.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, 
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the 
hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife 
menacingly.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
			It's only gonna end up with you getting
			Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (nervously)
			Awfully late time to be doing an interview.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			I need you as bait. For Sidney.

Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her.

<b>  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY 
PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is 
basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little 
magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream. 
The phone rings. Sid answers it.  

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (into phone)
			Hello?

<b>				SIDNEY'S VOICE(O.S.)
</b>			  (off phone)
			Hello?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Who is this?

<b>				PHONE SIDNEY(O.S.)
</b>			Um wh-who's calling?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, 
			I can only hear myself.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			  { a click }  
			I only her you too, Sidney. 

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Who is this?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			The question isn't who I am.  The question is, 
			who's with me. 

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (screaming)
			Sidney, stay away!

Sid's face floods with fear. She rushes towards the office door when suddenly, 
the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract 
			attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.   
			Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Yes.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Go there.

Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.  
			When you're friends with Sidney, you die!  
			Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.  
			It's up to you.  

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			How do I know their voices are --

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?  
			How do you know I'm not someone in your head?  
			Somewhere, you know.  

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (frantic)
			Don't come here Sidney!  

We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Dewey! No!

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Or do you?  

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			You're dead!

<b>				VOICE
</b>			I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. 
			You show yourself, they survive, you run, 
			they die! 

<b>				GALE
</b>			Oh God!  Oh God!

<b>				VOICE
</b>			Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to 
			know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who 
			killed your mother? 

<b>				COP(O.S.)
</b>			Have you seen Kincaid?

<b>				 COP 2(O.S.)
</b>			NO.  But Wallace is around.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Where?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b><b>			WHERE?
</b>
<b>				VOICE
</b>			I'll call you, when you're on your way.  

Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Fuck!

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when 
something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls 
up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

<b>  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (into phone)
			Yeah?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			You follow directions good.
			Now let's wrap this production.
			Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot.
			I'll call you when you get there.

Click. The killer hangs up.

<b>   CUT TO:
</b>

<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on 
the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.

<b>     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. 
Again, she answers it.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (into phone)
			Alright, I'm here. Now what?

<b>				VOICE
</b>			You're doing real good. Can't
			you figure it out? I wanna finish
			this where it all began. Woodsboro.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			I thought you wanted me here?

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is 
startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production 
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's 
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the 
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

<b>  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT
</b>
Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her 
this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. 
Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can 
			finish this.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			It's good to see you again Sidney.
			I was growing real impatient.
			Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE 
set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S 
CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

<b>INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT
</b>
Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house 
perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is 
there. Sid's phone rings. She answers it.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Yeah?

<b>				DEWEY(O.S.)
</b>			  (off phone)
			Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

<b>				 SIDNEY
</b>			Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!

<b>				DEWEY(O.S.)
</b>			Sid I can see you!

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Where are you Dewey?

<b>				DEWEY(O.S.)
</b>			I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid!
			The killer's looking for you!
			Quick untie me!

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated 
before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is 
DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN 
ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at 
the phone.

<b>				DEWEY(O.S.)
</b>			Good work Sid. 

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to 
face with --

<b>THE GHOST 
</b>
HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box 
in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.

<b>				GHOST
</b>			  (Sid's voice)
			You play a good game Sidney.
			Now it's time to get down to business.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Who are you?

<b>				GHOST
</b>			  (click-now he's Maureen's voice)
			Your other half.

 The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the 
darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own 
childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed. 

<b>INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT
</b>
Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer 
begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something 
upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT
</b>
Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from 
Kincaid's office.

LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --

<b>GALE WEATHERS
</b>
<b>				SIDNEY
</b><b>			GALE!
</b>
Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Christ Sidney hurry up!
			That fucking lunatic is coming!

Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Gale he's got Dewey!

<b>				GALE
</b>			I know! He killed Kincaid!

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			I know!

<b>				GALE
</b>			Let's get out of here!

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			   (screaming)
<b>			GALE WATCHOUT!
</b>
KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and 
Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails.

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
<b>DEWEY --
</b>
Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally 
beginning to pull and tug on his bindings.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape.

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT
</b>
Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and 
locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos 
outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the 
furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a 
black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the 
killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

<b>				GALE
</b>			Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here!
			He can't get us both!

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

<b>				GALE
</b><b>			RUNNN!
</b>
Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls 
utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

<b>BAM!
</b>
The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by 
her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in 
her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

<b>THE WINDOW SHATTERS.
</b>
Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf 
grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering 
open, blurrily staring up at --

THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.

SID stands up, takes off running towards --

<b>THE MACHER HOUSE SET.
</b>
<b>   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT
</b>
Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and 
bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in 
Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and 
evil wasfought. It's déjr vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S.

<b>				DEWEY(O.S.)
</b>			  (weakly)
			Sidney?

Sidney turns around --

DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (eyes lighting up)
			Dewey!

Sidney embraces Dewey.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Where's Gale?

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			They've got her!

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Sid I want you to stay here!
			I'll be right back!
			I'm not gonna let them get Gale!

Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open.

STANDING across the set is THE GHOST, knife raised.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (tightening grip on gun)
			 Hold it right there you fucker!

Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			  (nervously)
			OH shit!

THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before 
embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney 
screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid 
screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns 
around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at 
Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

<b>IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.
</b>
She's been brutally stabbed.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (crying)
			Oh God.

BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls 
out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			Time to sort things out.
			Whatta you say?

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  MACHER LIVING ROOM - SET - NIGHT
</b>
Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint. Gale's been handcuffed 
and tossed onto the couch.

<b>ON THE TV --
</b>
HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of MAUREEN PRESCOTT plays.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			It's you?! All of this is because of you?

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really  
			wants to meet you.  

Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her. Causing her to stop in her 
tracks.

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off.
			Not now.

<b>				VOICE(O.S.)
</b>			You're not going anywhere Sidney.
			It's time you came to terms with me, and with  
			mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.
			Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.

The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet 
proof vest.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Who the hell are you?

<b>				THE GHOST
</b>			The other half of you! I searched for a mother too, 
			an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her 
			my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked 
			her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome 
			me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a 
			new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only 
			child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold 
			forever, her own son!

THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.

<b>				ROMAN 
</b>			 Roman Bridger, director. And brother.
			  (a beat)
			She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was 
			Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, 
			what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little 
			home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, 
			mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one 
			thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, 
			that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing 
			his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And 
			once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was 
			a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case 
			you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like 
			her was making a movie.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			All the nightmares. All the hell I went through 
			was because of you, you spineless bastard!

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, 
			Angelina over there,
			  (Angelina smiles)
			She's my partner. I can convince her to do 
			anything.  We've been dating since I met her in 
			Woodsboro.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (dryly)
			Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You
			were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. 
			I wanted to make you proud.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of
			a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every
			time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			   (repulsed)
			Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit 
			before! So lets get on with it!

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.
			You haven't seen the best part.
			  (pulls out tape recorder)
			With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've 
			been able to steal your voice.
			  (presses play)
			Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna 
			find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			   (off tape recorder)
			I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation
			of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to 
			make you all repent for your sins, and now
			I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.

Sid squirms.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			   (clicking off tape recorder)
			Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that 
			John Milton, was my daddy?
			Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.
			 His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!
			That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.
			Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone
			in this world. What a good reason to --
<b>			STAB MYSELF!
</b>
Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's 
arms.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,
			they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,
			they also set the stage for you! Introducing
			to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
			survivor! Sidney the star!

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. 
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			See Sid, now comes the part where we get away
			with it! The part where we win! Cause face it
			Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you
			kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and
			not because of any other fucking reason!

<b>				ANGELINA
</b>			  (screaming)
			Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's
			freaking me out!

<b>				ROMAN
</b>			   (screaming)
			God damn it Sidney!

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls 
herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (coughing)
			Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain 
			Gale Weathers.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (leaping up)
			I know all the tricks!

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has 
a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

<b>MEANWHILE --
</b>
<b>ROMAN,
</b>
--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. 
He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE 
continues.

<b>GALE AND ANGELINA,
</b>
Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood 
floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, 
begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the 
knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

<b>SIDNEY--
</b>
Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

<b>SUDDENLY,
</b>
WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. 
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. 
Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his 
wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Dewey my God I thought you were dead.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			 Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

<b>SCREAMING O.S.  
</b>
<b>				SIDNEY
</b><b>			DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
</b>
Sidney and Dewey race into --

<b>LIVING ROOM --
</b>
Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

<b>				 GALE
</b>			  (screaming)
<b>			THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!
</b><b>			BITCH!
</b>
Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. 
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high 
voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and 
Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

<b>--FOYER --
</b>
THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

<b>					DEWEY
</b>			Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always 
			superhuman.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			He wasn't superhuman Dewey.
			He wasn't superhuman at all.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried 
mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, 
hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and 
brain matter onto the wall behind her.

<b>				GALE
</b><b>			WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!
</b>
Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

<b>POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --
</b>
<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			  (pissed)
			This shit is really getting repetitive,
			you know?

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT 
<b>SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.
</b>
Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

<b>   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING
</b>
The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

<b>INT.  AMBULANCE 
</b>
Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

<b>				DEWEY
</b>			Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what 
			if we try it out again.
			The whole relationship thing.

<b>				GALE
</b>			  (smiles)
			Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			Jesus Christ what happened?
			I leave for two seconds to take my
			kid to the doctor, I come back and it's
			the fucking WILD BUNCH.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			It was just something that's been itching 
			to be completed for the past four years.

<b>				DETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>			I guess so.

<b>				SIDNEY
</b>			Take care Detective. Give my regards
			to the wife and kids.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun 
rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we 
crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING. 
<b>AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.
</b>
<b>CUT TO BLACK
</b>
<b>THE END
