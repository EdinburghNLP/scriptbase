                    Screenplay

                    by

                    Stanley Kubrick



               Based on the novel by

               William Makepeace Thackeray
















                                    February 18, 1973






FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My father, who was well-known to the
     best circles in this kingdom under
     the name of roaring Harry James, was
     killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
     years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My mother, after her husband's
     death, and her retirement, lived in
     such a way as to defy slander.  She
     refused all offers of marriage,
     declaring that she lived now for her
     son only, and for the memory of her
     departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My mother was the most beautiful
     women of her day.  But if she was
     proud of her beauty, to do her
     justice, she was still more proud of
     her son, and has said a thousand
     times to me that I was the
     handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The good soul's pleasure was to
     dress me; and on Sundays and
     Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
     coat with a silver-hilted sword by
     my side, and a gold garter at my
     knee as fine as any lord in the
     land.  As we walked to church on
     Sundays, even the most envious souls
     would allow that there was not a
     prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My uncle's family consisted of ten
     children, and one of them was the
     cause of all my early troubles; this
     was the belle of the family, my
     cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Ah!  That first affair, how well one
     remembers it!  What a noble
     discovery it is that the boy makes
     when he finds himself actually and
     truly in love with some one!  A lady
     who is skilled in dancing or singing
     never can perfect herself without a
     deal of study in private.  So it is
     with the dear creatures who are
     skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
     instance, was always practicing, and
     she would take poor me to rehearse
     her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     ... or the exciseman, when he came
     his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     ... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     ... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     ... or the young apothecary's lad
     from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
     beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The torments of jealousy she made me
     endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

               RODERICK
     I accept, but I insist on a wager.
     The loser must do whatever the
     winner pleases.

               DOROTHY
     Agreed.

               RODERICK
     Do you see the gate at the end of
     the field?  The first to touch it
     will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was certain to win, but I meant to
     lose to see what she would order me
     to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

               DOROTHY
     Your penalty is to find a cherry-
     colored ribbon which I have hidden
     somewhere on my person.  You are
     free to look for it anywhere you
     will, and I will think very little
     of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

               RODERICK
     I feel the ribbon.

               DOROTHY
     Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

               DOROTHY
     Why are you shaking?

               RODERICK
     With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     About this time, the United Kingdom
     was in a state of great excitement
     from the threat generally credited
     of a French invasion.  The noblemen
     and people of condition in that and
     all other parts of the kingdom
     showed their loyalty by raising
     regiments of horse and foot to
     resist the invaders.  How I envied
     them.  The whole country was alive
     with war's alarums; the three
     kingdoms ringing with military
     music, while poor I was obliged to
     stay at home in my fustian jacket
     and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
     regiment gave a grand ball to which
     Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I have endured torments in my life,
     but none like that.  Some of the
     prettiest girls there offered to
     console me, for I was the best
     dancer in the room, but I was too
     wretched, and so remained alone all
     night in a state of agony.  I did
     not care for drink, or know the
     dreadful comfort of it in those
     days; but I thought of killing
     myself and Dorothy, and most
     certainly of making away with
     Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     At last, and at morning, the ball
     was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

               DOROTHY
     Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
     dear, and you'll catch cold without
     a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

               DOROTHY
     Did you and Miss Clancy have a
     pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
     were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

               DOROTHY
     Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
     throw me, you careless creature,
     you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

               RODERICK
     I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
     And I only danced with her because
     -- because -- the person with whom I
     intended to dance chose to be
     engaged the whole night.

               DOROTHY
     I had not been in the room five
     minutes before I was engaged for
     every single set.

               RODERICK
     Were you obliged to dance five times
     with Captain Best, and then stroll
     out with him into the garden?

               DOROTHY
     I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
     he dances prettily to be sure, and
     is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
     looks well in his regimentals, too;
     and if he chose to ask me to dance,
     how could I refuse him?

               RODERICK
     But you refused me, Dorothy.

               DOROTHY
     Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
     and to dance with your own cousin at
     a ball as if you could find no other
     partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
     Best's a man, and you are only a
     boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
     world.

               RODERICK
     If ever I meet him again, you shall
     see which is the best man of the
     two.  I'll fight him with sword or
     with pistol, captain as he is.

               DOROTHY
     But Captain Best is already known as
     a valiant soldier, and is famous as
     a man of fashion in London.  It is
     mighty well of you to fight farmers'
     boys, but to fight an Englishman is
     a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

               DOROTHY
     Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
     such a hero, was passing over the
     bridge and the enemy on the other
     side.

               RODERICK
     I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
     through them.

               DOROTHY
     What, with me on the pillion?  Would
     you kill poor me?

               RODERICK
     Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
     do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
     and swim you both across, where no
     enemy could follow us.

               DOROTHY
     Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
     to do any such thing on Daisy.
     There's the captain's horse, Black
     George, I've heard say that Captain
     Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

               RODERICK
     Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I went home, and was ill speedily of
     a fever, which kept me to my bed for
     a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Dorothy visited me only once, but I
     quitted my couch still more
     violently in love than I had been
     ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

               RODERICK
     Whose horse, fellow, is that?

               ORDERLY
     Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
     to my captain, and he's a better
     fellow nor you any day.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I did not stop to break his bones,
     as I would on another occasion, for
     a horrible suspicion had come across
     me, and I made for the garden as
     quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The fact is that, during the week of
     my illness, no other than Captain
     Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
     and making love to Miss Dorothy in
     form.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     No, Dorothy, except for you and four
     others, I vow before all the gods,
     my heart had never felt the soft
     flame.

               DOROTHY
     Ah, you men, you men, John, your
     passion is not equal to ours.  We
     are like -- like some plant I've
     read of -- we bear but one flower,
     and then we die!

               CAPTAIN BEST
     Do you mean you never felt an
     inclination for another?

               DOROTHY
     Never, my John, but for thee!  How
     can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I pulled out a knot of cherry-
     colored ribbons, which she had given
     me out of her breast, and which
     somehow I always wore upon me, and
     flung them in Captain Best's face,
     and rushed out with my little sword
     drawn.

               RODERICK
     She's a liar -- she's a liar,
     Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
     yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

               DOROTHY
     Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
     spare the child -- he is but an
     infant.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     And ought to be whipped for his
     impudence, but never fear, Miss
     Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
     favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

               CAPTAIN BEST
     When ladies make presents to
     gentlemen, it is time for other
     gentlemen to retire...

               DOROTHY
     Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
     and don't signify any more than my
     parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
     bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

               RODERICK
             (roaring)
     I'm a man, and will prove it.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
     many yards as you like.

               DOROTHY
     Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
     and you are always thinking of the
     shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
     will!  Roddy, will you see me
     insulted?

               RODERICK
     Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
     have his blood as sure as my name's
     Roderick.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     I'll send for the usher to cane you,
     little boy, but as for you, miss, I
     have the honor to wish you a good
     day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

               MICHAEL
     Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
     matter here?

               CAPTAIN BEST
     I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
     I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
     and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
     to 'em, sir.

               MICHAEL
             (good-humoredly)
     Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
     you used to our ways, or adopt
     English ones.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     It's not the English way, for ladies
     to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
     Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
     sum you owe me, and I resign all
     claims to this young lady.  If she
     has a fancy for school-boys, let her
     take 'em, sir.

               MICHAEL
     Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

               MICHAEL
             (in a towering rage)
     You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
     brat, your hand is in everybody's
     pie.  What business had you to come
     brawling and quarreling here, with
     a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
     a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

               DOROTHY
             (gasps)
     Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
     shall never leave this spot.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
             (whisper to Dorothy)
     The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
             (in a soothing tone
              to Roderick)
     This is a pretty way to recommend
     yourself to the family.

               RODERICK
             (shouts after
              Michael)
     The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
     must first kill me -- do you mind
     that?

               MICHAEL
             (shouting back from
              a distance)
     Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
     you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
     huntsman to do it.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     You are a gallant lad, and I like
     your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
     true.  It's a hard thing to give a
     lad counsel who is in such a far-
     gone state as you; but, believe me,
     I know the world, and if you will
     but follow my advice, you won't
     regret having taken it.  Dorothy
     Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
     whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
     don't you see -- though it's a hard
     matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
     and does not care a pin for you or
     Best either?

               RODERICK
     Dorothy might love me or not, as she
     likes, but Best will have to fight
     me before he marries her!

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Faith, I think you are a lad that's
     likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I must have sat for some hours
     bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
     for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
     at three o'clock, which wakened me
     from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

               MAID
     The Englishman's still there, Master
     Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
     Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
     you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

               UNCLE
     Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
     That's right.

               AUNT
     He'd better be home with his mother.

               UNCLE
     Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
     she ate for breakfast -- didn't
     agree with her.  Take a glass of
     spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
     health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

               UNCLE
     Dorothy, divide that merry thought
     with the captain!  See who'll be
     married first.  Jack Best, my dear
     boy, never mind a clean glass for
     the claret, we're short of crystal
     at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
     the wine will taste none the worse.
     Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
     please; this is a sort of toast that
     is drunk a great deal too seldom in
     my family, and you'll please to
     receive it with all the honors.
     Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
     Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
     her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
     you've got a treasure.

               RODERICK
             (spring up)
     His already?!

               HARRY
     Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
     your tongue!

               RODERICK
             (shouting)
     He has already been slapped in the
     face this morning, Captain John
     Best; he's already been called a
     coward, Captain John Best; and this
     is the way I'll drink his health.
     Here's your health, Captain John
     Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

               HARRY
     You fool!  You great blundering
     marplot -- you silly beggarly
     brat --
             (a thump at each)
     Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

               UNCLE
     In Heaven's name, what does all the
     row mean?  Is the boy in fever
     again?

               HARRY
             (turning to his
              father)
     The fact is, sir, that the young
     monkey has fallen in love with
     Dorothy, and finding her and the
     captain mighty sweet in the garden
     today, he was for murdering Jack
     Best.

               CAPTAIN BEST
             (bristling up)
     And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
     I've been insulted grossly in this
     house.  I ain't at all satisfied
     with these here ways of going on.
     I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
     of property; and I -- I --

               HARRY
     If you're insulted, and not
     satisfied, remember there's two of
     us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

               RODERICK
             (in dignified tone)
     Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
     any time he pleases, by calling on
     Roderick James, Esquire, of
     Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

               RODERICK
     Captain Grogan, I beg you to
     understand that, for my cousin
     Harry, who has been my best friend
     through life, I could put up with
     rough treatment from him; yet, even
     that sort of treatment I will bear
     from him no longer; and any other
     person who ventures on the like will
     not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
     that fact very well; and, if he's
     man, he'll know where to find me.

               UNCLE
     It is getting late, and your mother
     will be anxious about you.  One of
     you had better go home with him.
             (turning to his sons)
     Or the lad may be playing more
     pranks.

               HARRY
     Both of us ride home with Best here.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
     man is armed, and so am I.

               HARRY
     You know the use of arms very well,
     Best, and no one can doubt your
     courage; but Michael and I will see
     you home for all that.

               UNCLE
     Why, you'll not be home till
     morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
     ten miles from here.

               HARRY
     We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
     We're going to stop a week there.
     And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     A pretty day's work of it you have
     made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
     uncle to be distressed for money,
     and try and break off a match which
     will bring fifteen hundred a-year
     into the family?  Best has promised
     to pay off the four thousand pounds
     which is bothering your uncle so.
     He takes a girl without a penny -- a
     girl that has been flinging herself
     at the head of every man in these
     parts these ten years past, and
     missing them all, and a boy who
     ought to be attached to your uncle
     as to your father.

               RODERICK
     And so I am.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     And this is the return you make for
     his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
     in his house when your father died,
     and hasn't he given you and your
     mother, rent-free, your fine house
     of Jamesville yonder?

               RODERICK
     Mark this, come what will of it, I
     swear I will fight the man who
     pretends to the hand of Dorothy
     Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
     the church, and meet him there.
     I'll have his blood, or he shall
     have mine.  Will you take my message
     to him, and arrange the meeting?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
     young fellow, you are the most
     bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
     officer, bearing His Majesty's
     commission, can receive a glass of
     wine on his nose, without resenting
     it -- fight you must, and Best is a
     huge, strong fellow.

               RODERICK
     He'll give the better mark.  I am
     not afraid of him.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     In faith, I believe you are not; for
     a lad I never saw more game in my
     life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
     You're after my own soul.  As long
     as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
     never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
     afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
     thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
     know what is in store for us, and
     that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     In spite of my precautions to
     secrecy, I half-suspected that my
     mother knew all from the manner in
     which she embraced me on my arrival,
     and received our guest, Captain
     Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But she would not say a word about
     the quarrel, for she had a noble
     spirit, and would as lief have seen
     any one of her kindred hanged as
     shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I never slept sounder in my life,
     though I woke a little earlier than
     usual, and you may be sure my first
     thought was of the event of the day,
     for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And now I sat down and wrote a
     couple of letters; they might be the
     last, thought I, that I should ever
     write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Then I went down to breakfast, where
     my mother was waiting for me, you
     may be sure.  We did not say a
     single word about what was taking
     place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

               MOTHER
     Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Ah!  They have their faults, those
     mothers; but are there any other
     women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

               RODERICK
     Have you taken my message to him?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     The meeting is arranged.  Captain
     Best is waiting for you now.

               RODERICK
     My mare is saddled and ready; who's
     the captain's second?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
     The curtains of her bedroom-windows
     were down, and they didn't move as
     we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     That's a very handsome sword you
     have there.

               RODERICK
     It was with this sword that my late
     father, Harry James, God rest his
     soul, met Sir Huddelstone
     Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
     and was fatally run through the
     neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
     having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
     when in liquor, at the Brentford
     Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
     scorned to apologize.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     And now you risk the same fate.  If
     you are killed, your mother is all
     alone in the world.

               RODERICK
     I am Harry James' son, and will act
     as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

               RODERICK
             (to Captain Grogan)
     I hope to spoil this sport, and
     trust to see this sword of mine in
     that big bully's body.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
     are no match for Best with the
     sword.

               RODERICK
     I'll match any man with the sword.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     But swords are today impossible;
     Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
     knocked his knee against the
     swinging park gate last night, as he
     was riding home, and can scarce move
     it now.

               RODERICK
     Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
     has been off the hinges these ten
     years.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     I have just explained to Mister
     James that Captain Best is lame, and
     that swords are impossible.

               HARRY
     Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

               HARRY
     And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
     boy.  You were a dead man else, for
     he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
     he, Grogan?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
     the man who stood to Captain Best.

               HARRY
     Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
     ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
     Roderick.  You can easily say that.

               CAPTAIN BEST
     If the young feller will go to
     Dublin, as proposed...

               RODERICK
     I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
     -- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
     to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
     silly business.  The girl will marry
     Best, mark my words; and as sure as
     she does, you'll forget her.  You
     are but a boy.  Best is willing to
     consider you as such.  Dublin's a
     fine place, and if you have a mind
     to take a ride thither and see the
     town for a month, here are twenty
     guineas at your service.  Make Best
     an apology, and be off.

               RODERICK
     A man of honor dies, but never
     apologizes.  I'll see the captain
     hanged before I apologize.

               HARRY
             (with a laugh to
              Grogan)
     There's nothing else for it.  Take
     your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
     I suppose?

               CAPTAIN BEST
             (in a big voice)
     Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
     do you hear, Captain Grogan?

               HARRY
     Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
     pistols.
             (with some emotion
              to Roderick)
     God bless you, my boy; and when I
     count three, fire.

               RODERICK
     This is not one of my pistols.

               HARRY
     They are all right, never fear.
     It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
     if they are needed, for the next
     round.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
     him there under the gorget; see how
     the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

               THE SECONDS
             (crying out)
     He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

               MICHAEL
     He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

               HARRY
     How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

               MICHAEL
             (with a scowl)
     The young fellow has begun well.
     You had better ride off, young sir,
     before the police are up.  They had
     wind of the business before we left
     Kilwangan.

               RODERICK
     Is he quite dead?

               MICHAEL
     Quite dead.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     Then the world's rid of a coward.
     It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
     doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

               HARRY
     We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
     he was!  Let's get the boy off as
     quick as we may.  Your man shall go
     for a cart, and take away the body
     of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
     been a sad day's work for our
     family, Roderick James, and you have
     robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

               RODERICK
     It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

               RODERICK
     There!  Take her those ribbons.
     She'll know what they mean; that's
     all that's left of her of two lovers
     she had and ruined.

               MICHAEL
     And now, in Heaven's name, get the
     youngster out of the way.

               HARRY
     I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I need not tell you how great was my
     mother's pride and exultation when
     she heard from Harry's lips the
     account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

               HARRY
     The boy must go into hiding, for a
     short time anyway.  Dublin is the
     best place for him to go, and there
     wait until matters are blown over.

               MOTHER
     Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
     been away from home.  He will be as
     safe here as in Dublin.

               HARRY
     I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
     but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
     already be on their way from
     Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Harry persisted in the necessity of
     instant departure, in which
     argument, as I was anxious to see
     the world, I must confess, I sided
     with him; and my mother was brought
     to see that, in our small house, in
     the midst of a village, escape would
     be impossible, and capture would be
     impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

               MOTHER
             (gravely)
     Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
     have forebodings that our separation
     is to be a long one.  I spent most
     of all night consulting the cards
     regarding your fate in the duel, and
     all signs betoke a separation.  Here
     is twenty guineas -- all that I have
     in the world -- and I want you to
     keep your father's sword and
     pistols, which you have known to use
     so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She hurried my departure now, though
     her heart, I know, was full, and
     almost in half-an-hour from my
     arrival at home, I was once more on
     the road again, with the wide world,
     as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     No lad of seventeen is very sad who
     has liberty for the first time, and
     twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
     rode away, thinking, I confess, not
     so much of the kind of mother left
     alone, and of the home behind me, as
     of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
     would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had no doubts of the future;
     thinking that a man of my person,
     parts, and courage, could make his
     way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
     to myself, or chatting with the
     passersby; and all the girls along
     the road said, "God save me, for a
     clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
     there seemed to be a gap of a half-
     a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

               ARMED GENTLEMAN
     Good day to you, young sir.

               RODERICK
     Good morning.

               ARMED GENTLEMAN
     Where are you bound for?

               RODERICK
             (after a long look at
              his companion)
     That is none of your business.

               ARMED GENTLEMAN
     Is your mother not afraid on account
     of the highwayman to let one so
     young as you travel?

               RODERICK
             (pulling out a
              pistol)
     Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
     good pistols that have already done
     execution, and are ready to do it
     again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     A little later on, as I rode towards
     Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
     people assembled round a one-horse
     chair, and my friend in green, as I
     thought, making off half-a-mile up
     the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

               FOOTMAN
     Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

               COUNTRY FELLOW #1
     Sure, you might have kept him off
     with your blunderbush!

               COUNTRY FELLOW #2
     O the coward!  To let the Captain
     bate you, and he only one eye!

               COUNTRY FELLOW #3
     The next time my lady travels, she'd
     better leave you at home!

               RODERICK
     What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

               RODERICK
     What has happened, madam, to annoy
     your ladyship?

               MRS. O'REILLY
     Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
     the wife of Captain O'Reilly
     hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
     chair was stopped by a highwayman;
     this great oaf of a servant-man fell
     down on his knees, armed as he was,
     and though there were thirty people
     in the next field, working, when the
     ruffian attacked, not one of them
     would help but, on the contrary,
     wished him "good luck."

               COUNTRY FELLOW #1
     Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
     and good luck to him.

               COUNTRY FELLOW #2
     Was it any business of ours?

               RODERICK
             (shouting)
     Be off to your work, you pack of
     rascals, or you will have a good
     taste of my thong.
             (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
     Have you lost much?

               MRS. O'REILLY
     Everything -- my purse, containing
     upwards of a hundred guineas, my
     jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
     And all because this blundering
     coward fell to his knees...

               FOOTMAN
     Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
     Didn't he return you the thirteen
     pence in copper, and the watch,
     saying it was only pinchbeck?

               MRS. O'REILLY
     Don't be insolent, or I'll report
     you to the Captain.

               FOOTMAN
     Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

               MRS. O'REILLY
     That fool didn't know what was the
     meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
     which was in the pocket-book that
     the fellow took from me.

               RODERICK
     I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
     your ladyship will allow me the
     honor of riding with you, I shall do
     my best to protect you from further
     mishap.

               MRS. O'REILLY
     But I shouldn't like to put you to
     such trouble, Mister...?

               RODERICK
     O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

               RODERICK
             (very gallantly)
     As you have been robbed of your
     purse, may I have permission to lend
     your ladyship a couple of pieces to
     pay any expenses which you might
     incur before reaching your home?

               MRS. O'REILLY
             (smiling)
     That's very kind of you, Mr.
     O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     How different was her lively rattle
     to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
     assemblies.  In every sentence, she
     mentioned a lord or a person of
     quality.  To the lady's question
     about my birth and parentage, I
     replied that I was a young gentleman
     of large fortune, that I was going
     to Dublin for my studies, and that
     my mother allowed me five hundred
     per annum.

               MRS. O'REILLY
     You must be very cautious with
     regard to the company you should
     meet in Dublin, where rogues and
     adventurers of all countries abound.
     I hope you will do me the honor of
     accepting lodgings in my own house,
     where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
     with delight, my gallant young
     preserver.

Paying the bill.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Perhaps had I been a little older in
     the world's experience, I should
     have begun to see that Madame
     O'Reilly was not the person of
     fashion she pretended to be; but, as
     it was, I took all her stories for
     truth, and, when the landlord
     brought the bill for dinner, paid it
     with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
     made no motion to produce the two
     pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And so we rode on slowly towards
     Dublin, into which city we made our
     entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
     and splendor of the coaches, the
     flare of the linkboys, the number
     and magnificence of the houses,
     struck me with the greatest wonder;
     though I was careful to disguise
     this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We stopped at length at a house of
     rather mean appearance, and were let
     into a passage which had a great
     smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
     grateful I am for your timely
     assistance to my wife.

               RODERICK
     I am only sorry that I was unable to
     prevent the villain from carrying
     off all her ladyship's money and
     pearls.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
     and rest assured, sir, you have
     friends in this house whenever you
     are in Dublin.
             (pours a glass)
     Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
     your good father?

               RODERICK
     Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
     have never heard your name mentioned
     in my family.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
     of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
     was a close friend of my wife's dear
     father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

               RODERICK
     Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
     are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     My love, I wish I had known of your
     coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
     finished the most delicious venison
     pasty, which His Grace the Lord
     Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
     sillery from his own cellar.  You
     know the wine, my dear?  But as
     bygones are bygones, and no help for
     them, what say ye to a fine lobster
     and a bottle of as good claret as
     any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
     things from the table, and make the
     mistress and our young friend
     welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
     don't seem to have any small change.
     May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
     give to the girl?

               MRS. O'REILLY
     I have some money, my dear.  Here,
     Betty, go to the fishmonger and
     bring back our supper, and mind you
     get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Our supper was seasoned, if not by
     any great elegance, at least by a
     plentiful store of anecdotes,
     concerning the highest personages of
     the city, with whom, according to
     himself, the captain lived on terms
     of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
     behind hand with him, I spoke of my
     own estates and property as if I was
     as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Had I been an English lad, the
     appearance of the chamber I occupied
     might, indeed, have aroused
     instantly my suspicion and distrust.
     But we are not particular in Ireland
     on the score of neatness, hence the
     disorder of my bed-chamber did not
     strike me so much.

Broken door.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Was there a lock to the door, or a
     hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Though my counterpane was evidently
     a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
     O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And my cracked toilet-glass not much
     bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
     used to these sort of ways in Irish
     houses, and still thought myself to
     be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     There was no lock to the drawers,
     which, when they did open, were full
     of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
     stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     I needn't ask whether you had a
     comfortable bed.  Young Fred
     Pimpleton slept in it for seven
     months, during which he did me the
     honor to stay with me, and if he was
     satisfied, I don't know who else
     wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     After breakfast, we drove out to
     Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
     young gentry were known to Mrs.
     O'Reilly, to all of whom she
     presented me in such a complimentary
     way that, before half an hour, I had
     got to be considered as a gentleman
     of great expectations and large
     property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had little notion then that I had
     got amongst a set of impostors --
     that Captain O'Reilly was only an
     adventurer, and his lady a person of
     no credit.  The fact was, a young
     man could hardly have fallen into
     worse hands than those in which I
     now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Their friends were always welcome on
     payment of a certain moderate sum
     for their dinner after which, you
     may be sure, that cards were not
     wanting, and that the company who
     played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     What could happen to a man but
     misfortune from associating with
     such company?  And in a very, very
     short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

               RODERICK
     I shall have to write out a note for
     the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

               COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
     Master Roderick, you appear a young
     fellow of birth and fortune; let me
     whisper in your ear that you have
     fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
     regular gang of swindlers; and a
     gentleman of your rank and quality
     should never be seen in such
     company.  The captain has been a
     gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
     of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
     your valise, pay the little trifle
     you owe me, mount your mare, and
     ride back again to your parents --
     it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Into a pretty nest of villains,
     indeed, was I plunged!  When I
     returned to my bed-chamber, a few
     hours later, it seemed as if all my
     misfortunes were to break on me at
     once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Whom have I been harboring in my
     house?  Who are you, sirrah?

               RODERICK
     Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
     gentleman as any in Ireland!

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     You're an impostor, young man, a
     schemer, a deceiver!

               RODERICK
     Repeat the words again, and I run
     you through the body.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
     well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
     Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
     secret is known, is it?  You come
     like a viper into the bosom of
     innocent families; you represent
     yourself as the heir to my friends
     the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
     introduce you to the nobility and
     gentry of this methropolis; I take
     you to my tradesmen, who give you
     credit.  I accept your note for near
     two hundred pounds, and what do I
     find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
     Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
     but Roderick James of the devil only
     knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

               RODERICK
     Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
     you why I was obliged to alter my
     name, which is James and the best
     name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
     because, on the day before I came to
     Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
     combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
     Captain in His Majesty's service;
     and if you offer to let or hinder me
     in the slightest way, the same arm
     which destroyed him is ready to
     punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

               MRS. O'REILLY
     Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
     O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
     child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
     Heaven's name, let him go.

               CAPTAIN O'REILLY
             (sulkily)
     He may go hang for me, and he's
     better be off quickly, for I shall
     go to the magistrate if I see him
     again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Where was now a home for the
     descendant of the James?  I was
     expelled from Dublin by a
     persecution occasioned, I must
     confess, by my own imprudence.  I
     had no time to wait and choose.  No
     place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     There was a score of recruiting
     parties in the town beating up for
     men to join our gallant armies in
     America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

               RODERICK
     I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
     a young gentleman in difficulties; I
     have killed an officer in a duel,
     and I am anxious to get out of the
     country.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But I needn't have troubled myself
     with any explanations; King George
     was in too much want of men to heed
     from whence they came -- and a
     fellow of my inches was always
     welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
     chosen my time better.  A transport
     was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
     wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I never had a taste for any thing
     but genteel company, and hate all
     descriptions of low life.  Hence my
     account of the society in which I at
     present found myself must of
     necessity be short.  The
     reminiscences of the horrid black-
     hole of a place in which we soldiers
     were confined, of the wretched
     creatures with whom I was now forced
     to keep company, of the plowmen,
     poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
     refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
     in truth, I had done myself, is
     enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

               RODERICK
     Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

               MR. TOOLE
     Get the gentleman a towel for his
     hands, and serve him a basin of
     turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

               LINK-BOY
             (whispers)
     If you want to vex him, ask him
     about his wife, the washerwoman, who
     bates him.

               RODERICK
     Is it a towel of your wife's
     washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
     wiped your face often with one.

               LINK-BOY
             (whispers)
     Ask him why he wouldn't see her
     yesterday, when she came to the
     ship.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And so I put to him some other
     foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
     pecking, and flat-irons, which set
     the man into a fury, and succeeded
     in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     This victory over the cock of the
     vile dunghill obtained me respect
     among the wretches among whom I
     formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Our passage was very favorable, and
     in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
     and before I had been a month in the
     Electorate, I was transported into a
     tall and proper young soldier, and,
     having a natural aptitude for
     military exercise, was soon as
     accomplished at the drill as the
     oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Six weeks after we arrived in
     Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
     Gales regiment of foot from England,
     and I promise you the sight of
     Grogan's face was most welcome to
     me, for it assured me that a friend
     was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Grogan gave me a wink of
     recognition, but offered no public
     token of acquaintance and it was not
     until two days afterwards that he
     called me into his quarters, and
     then, shaking hands with me
     cordially, gave me news which I
     wanted, of my family.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
     you've begun early, like your
     father's son, but I think you could
     not do better than as you have done.
     But why did you not write home to
     your poor mother?  She has sent
     half-a-dozen letters to you in
     Dublin.

               RODERICK
     I suppose she addressed them to me
     in my real name, by which I never
     thought to ask for them at the post
     office.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     We must write to her today, and you
     can tell her that you are safe and
     married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     I see you are thinking of a certain
     young lady at Duganstown.

               RODERICK
     Is Miss Dugan well?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     There's only six Miss Dugans now...
     poor Dorothy.

               RODERICK
     Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
     died of grief?

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     She took on so at your going away
     that she was obliged to console
     herself with a husband.  She is now
     Mrs. John Best.

               RODERICK
     Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
     Mr. John Best?!

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     No, the very same one, my boy.  He
     recovered from his wound.  The ball
     you hit him with was not likely to
     hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
     Do you think the Dugans would let
     you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
     of the family?  The plan of the duel
     was all arranged in order to get you
     out of the way, for the cowardly
     Englishman could never be brought to
     marry from fear of you.  But hit him
     you certainly did, Roderick, and
     with a fine thick plugget of tow,
     and the fellow was so frightened
     that he was an hour in coming to.
     We told your mother the story
     afterwards, and a pretty scene she
     made.

               RODERICK
     The coward!

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     He has paid off your uncle's
     mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
     and-six.  That coward of a fellow
     has been making of your uncle's
     family.  Faith, the business was
     well done.  Your cousins, Michael
     and Harry, never let him out of
     their sight, though he was for
     deserting to England, until the
     marriage was completed, and the
     happy couple off on their road to
     Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
     boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
     a couple of hundred out of Master
     Best for my share and, while they
     last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Our regiment, which was quartered
     about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
     had got orders to march southwards
     towards the Rhine, where we would
     fight the famous battle of Minden.
     It would require a greater
     philosopher and historian than I am
     to explain the causes of the famous
     Seven Years' War in which Europe was
     engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
     always appeared to me to be so
     complicated, and the books written
     about it so amazingly hard to
     understand, that I have seldom been
     much wiser at the end of a chapter
     than at the beginning, and so shall
     not trouble you with any personal
     disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Were these memoirs not characterized
     by truth, I might easily make myself
     the hero of some strange and popular
     adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But I saw no one of the higher ranks
     that day than my colonel and a
     couple of orderly officers riding by
     in the smoke -- no one on our side,
     that is.  A poor corporal is not
     generally invited into the company
     of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
     you, some very good company on the
     French part, for their regiments of
     Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
     charging us all day; and in the sort
     of melee high and low are pretty
     equally received.  I hate bragging,
     but I cannot help saying that I made
     a very close acquaintance with the
     colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And finished off a poor little
     ensign, so young, slender, and
     small, that a blow from my pigtail
     would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And in the poor ensign's pocket
     found a purse of fourteen louis
     d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
     plums, of which the former present
     was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     If people would tell their stories
     of battles in this simple way, I
     think the cause of truth would not
     suffer by it.  All I know of this
     famous fight of Minden, except from
     books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

               CAPTAIN
     Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
     your company.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     That was all the epitaph my brave
     patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

               CAPTAIN GROGAN
     I should have left you a hundred
     guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
     run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     When we came back to our ground,
     which we presently did, he was lying
     still, but he was dead.  Some of our
     people had already torn off his
     epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
     his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     After the death of my protector,
     Captain Grogan, I am forced to
     confess that I fell into the very
     worst of courses and company.  In a
     foreign country, with the enemy
     before us, and the people
     continually under contribution from
     one side or the other, numberless
     irregularities were permitted to the
     troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
     talk of the age of chivalry; but
     remember the starving brutes whom
     they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
     entirely ignorant, made to take
     pride in deeds of blood -- men who
     can have no amusement but in
     drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
     It is with these shocking
     instruments that your great warriors
     and kings have been doing their
     murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The year in which George II died,
     our regiment had the honor to be
     present at the Battle of Warburg,
     where Prince Ferdinand once more
     completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     During the action, my lieutenant,
     Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
     struck by a musket-ball in the side.
     He had shown no want of courage in
     this or any other occasion where he
     had been called upon to act against
     the French; but this was his first
     wound, and the young gentleman was
     exceedingly frightened by it.

               LAKENHAM
     Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
     pay you five guineas if you will
     carry me into the town which is hard
     by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We put the patient to bed, and he
     paid me the stipulated reward.  A
     young surgeon, who desired nothing
     better than to take himself out of
     the fire of the musketry, came
     presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

               PRIVATE
     I should get half.

               RODERICK
     Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

               PRIVATE
     He gave you five guineas, and I
     bloody well expect half.

               RODERICK
     Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

               LAKENHAM
             (languidly, in pain)
     Who are you putting into that bed?

               LISCHEN
     We have the Corporal, wounded, to
     you bringing.

               LAKENHAM
     A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
     sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I found Lischen the tenderest of
     nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
     to be provided for the wounded
     lieutenant, a share was always sent
     to the bed opposite his, and to the
     avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Nor was I the only person in the
     house to whom the worthy gentleman
     was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
     Lischen hither and thither, made
     impertinent love to her, abused her
     soups, quarreled with her
     omelettes, and grudged the money
     which was laid out for his
     maintenance, so that our hostess
     detested him as much as, I think,
     without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     For if truth must be told, I had
     made very deep love to her during my
     stay under her roof, as is always my
     way with women, of whatever age or
     degree of beauty.  Do not think me
     very cruel and heartless, ladies;
     this heart of Lischen's was like
     many a town, which had been stormed
     and occupied several times before I
     came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I began to reflect how pleasant my
     quarters were to me, and that I was
     much better here than crawling under
     an odious tent with a parcel of
     tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
     rounds, or rising long before
     daybreak for drill.  I determined
     that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

               RODERICK
     I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
     to take my leave of you.  I intend
     to have your papers and purse.

               LAKENHAM
     You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
     dog!  What do you mean by dressing
     yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
     as my name's Lakenham, when we get
     back to the regiment, I'll have your
     soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

               RODERICK
     Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
     are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My companion treated me with great
     civility, and asked me a thousand
     questions about England, which I
     answered as best I might.  But this
     best, I am bound to say, was bad
     enough.  I knew nothing about
     England, and I invented a thousand
     stories which I told him; described
     the king and the ministers to him,
     said the British ambassador in
     Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
     acquaintance a letter of
     recommendation to him.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     What is your uncle's name?

               RODERICK
             (slowly)
     O'Grady.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
             (with a laugh)
     Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
     O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     It hurts my feelings to be obliged
     to commune with such wretches, but
     the stern necessities of war demand
     men continually, and hence these
     recruiters whom you see market in
     human flesh.  They get five-and-
     twenty thaler a man from our
     government for every man they bring
     in.  For fine men -- for men like
     you.
             (he adds laughing)
     They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     This is a very good inn.  Shall we
     stop for dinner?

               RODERICK
     This may be a very good inn for
     Germany, but it would not pass in
     old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
     league off, let us push on for
     Corbach.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Do you want to see the loveliest
     woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
     influence you.

               RODERICK
     The place seems more a farm than an
     inn-yard.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     The people are great farmers, as
     well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
             (explaining the gate)
     Parties of French horsemen are about
     the country, and one cannot take too
     many precautions against such
     villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
     a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

               RODERICK
             (when she leaves)
     Where's the beauty you promised me?

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
             (laughing and looking
              hard at Roderick)
     It was my joke.  I was tired, and
     did not care to go farther.  There's
     not prettier woman here than that.
     If she won't suit your fancy, my
     friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

               RODERICK
             (sternly)
     Upon my word, sir, I think you have
     acted very coolly.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     I have acted as I think fit.

               RODERICK
     Sir, I'm a British officer.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
     You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
     and folly have confirmed this to me.
     You pretend to carry dispatches to a
     general who has been dead these ten
     months; you have an uncle who is an
     ambassador and whose name you don't
     know.  Will you join and take the
     bounty, sir, or will you be given
     up?

               RODERICK
     Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Advance a step, and I send this
     bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

               RODERICK
     I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     At the close of the Seven Years' War,
     the Prussian army, so renowned for
     its disciplined valor, was
     officered and under-officered by
     native Prussians, it is true, but
     was composed for the most part of
     men hired or stolen, like myself,
     from almost every nation in Europe.
     The deserting to and fro was
     prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The life the private soldier led was
     a frightful one to any but the men
     of iron courage and endurance.  The
     punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was not near so unhappy, in spite
     of all, as I had been on my first
     enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
     there will be no one of my
     acquaintance who will witness my
     shame, and that is the point which I
     have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
     you are caught, there is no use in
     repining -- make the best of your
     situation, and get all the pleasure
     you can out of it.  There are a
     thousand opportunities of plunder,
     offered to the soldier in war time,
     out of which he can get both
     pleasure and profit; make use of
     these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I do not intend to make a history of
     battles in the Prussian any more
     than in the English service.  I did
     my duty in them as well as another,
     and there was not a braver,
     cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
     own, wickeder soldier in the
     Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

               RODERICK
     I had formed myself to the condition
     of the proper fighting beast; on a
     day of action, I was savage and
     happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

               COLONEL BULOW
     You are a gallant soldier, and have
     evidently come of good stock; but
     you are idle, dissolute, and
     unprincipled; you have done a deal
     of harm to the men; and, for all
     your talents and bravery, I am sure
     you will come to no good.

               RODERICK
     I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
     regarding my character.  I have
     fallen into bad company, it is true;
     but I have only done as other
     soldiers have done; and, above all,
     I have never had a kind friend and
     protector before, to whom I might
     show that I was worthy of better
     things.  The Colonel may say I am a
     ruined lad, and send me to the
     devil; but be sure of this, I would
     go to the devil to serve the
     regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Soon after the war ended, our
     regiment was garrisoned in the
     capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
     all the towns of Prussia; but that
     does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

               RODERICK
     Private Roderick James.  First
     Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
     Galgenstein sent for me.

               PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
     You may wait.

               RODERICK
     Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

               PRIVATE
     Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
     the Captain's furniture, but the
     driver says he is not supposed to
     unload it.  Is it possible for you
     to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
     Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
     You are a model of probity!  You'll
     never succeed to my place, my dear
     nephew, if you are no wiser than you
     are just now.  Make the fellow as
     useful to you as you please.  You
     say he has a good manner and a frank
     countenance, that he can lie with
     assurance, and fight, you say, on a
     pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
     for good qualities.  As long as you
     have the regiment in terrorem over
     him, you can do as you like with
     him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
     is likely to give you the slip.
     Keep on promising him; promise to
     make him a general, if you like.
     What the deuce do I care?  There are
     spies enough to be had in this town
     without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Good morning, Private James.  Please
     come in.  I should like you to meet
     my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
     Galgenstein.

               RODERICK
     How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The captain was the nephew and heir
     of the Minister of Police, Herr
     Galgenstein, a relationship which,
     no doubt, aided in the younger
     gentlemen's promotion.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Your loyalty to me and your service
     to the regiment has pleased me very
     well -- and now there is another
     occasion on which you may make
     yourself useful to us; if you
     succeed, depend on it, your reward
     will be your discharge from the
     army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

               RODERICK
     What is the service, sir?

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     There is lately come to Berlin a
     gentleman in the service of the
     Empress Queen, who calls himself the
     Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
     the red riband and star of the
     pope's order of the Spur.  He is
     made for good society, polished,
     obliging, a libertine, without
     prejudices, fond of women, of good
     food, of high play, prudent and
     discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     He speaks Italian and French
     indifferently; but we have some
     reason to fancy this Monsieur de
     Belle Fast is a native of your
     country of Ireland, and that he has
     come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Naturally, your knowledge of English
     makes you an ideal choice to go into
     his service.  Of course, you will
     not know a word of English; and if
     the Chevalier asks as to the
     particularity of your accent, say
     you are Hungarian.  The servant who
     came with him will be turned away
     today, and the person to whom he has
     applied for a faithful fellow will
     recommend you.

Roderick nods.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     You are a Hungarian; you served in
     the army, and left on account of
     weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
     great deal, and wins.  Do you know
     the cards well?

               RODERICK
     Only a very little, as soldiers do.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     I had thought you more expert.  You
     must find out if the Chevalier
     cheats.  He sees the English and
     Austrian envoys continually, and the
     young men of either ministry sup
     repeatedly at his house.  Find out
     what they talk of, for how much each
     plays, especially if any of them
     play on parole.  If you are able to,
     read his private letters, though
     about those which go to the post,
     you need not trouble yourself -- we
     look at them there.  But never see
     him write a note without finding out
     to whom it goes, and by what channel
     or messenger.  He sleeps with the
     keys of his dispatch-box with a
     string around his neck -- twenty
     frederics, if you get an impression
     of the keys.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     Does this assignment interest you?

               RODERICK
     Yes, Minister, I am interested in
     any work in which I can be of
     service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

               CHEVALIER
     You are the young man who M. de
     Seebach recommended?

               RODERICK
     Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

               CHEVALIER
     Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

               RODERICK
     Yes, sir.

               CHEVALIER
     You come highly recommended by Herr
     Seebach.

               RODERICK
     Herr Seebach was a very kind
     employer.

               CHEVALIER
     For whom else have you worked?

               RODERICK
     No one, sir.  Before that I served
     in the army but had to leave due to
     weakness of the loins.

               CHEVALIER
     Who else can give me information
     about you?

               RODERICK
     Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

               CHEVALIER
     You will do.  I will give you 30...
     a day.  I do not provide your
     clothing; you will sleep at home,
     and you will be at my orders every
     morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

               CHEVALIER
     Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was very imprudent of me; but
     when I saw the splendor of his
     appearance, the nobleness of his
     manner, I felt it impossible to keep
     disguise with him.  You, who have
     never been out of your country know
     little what it is to hear a friendly
     voice in captivity; and there's a
     many a man that will understand the
     cause of the burst of feeling which
     was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

               RODERICK
             (as he speaks,
              bursting into tears)
     Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
     am an Irishman, and my name is
     Roderick James.  I was abducted into
     the Prussian army two years ago, and
     now I have been put into your
     service by my Captain and his uncle,
     the Minister of Police, to serve as
     a watch upon your actions, of which
     I am to give information to the same
     quarter.  For this odious service, I
     have been promised my discharge, and
     a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

               CHEVALIER
     The rascals!  They think to catch
     me, do they?  Why, young man, my
     chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
     But the king is so jealous, that he
     will see a spy in every person who
     comes to his miserable capital, in
     the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And I think he was as much affected
     as I was at thus finding one of his
     kindred; for he, too, was an exile
     from home, and a friendly voice, a
     look, brought the old country back
     to his memory again, and the old
     days of his boyhood.

               CHEVALIER
     I'd give five years of my life to
     see the old country again, the
     greenfields, and the river, and the
     old round tower, and the burying
     place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

               CHEVALIER
     My lad, I have been in every
     service; and, between ourselves, owe
     money in every capital in Europe.  I
     have been a rolling stone.  Play --
     play has been my ruin!  That and
     beauty.  The women have made a fool
     of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
     hearted creature, and this minute,
     at sixty-two, have no more command
     of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
     made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

               CHEVALIER
     The cards are now my only
     livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
     and then I lay out my money in these
     trinkets you see.  It's property,
     look you, and the only way I have
     found of keeping a little about me.
     When the luck goes against me, why,
     my dear, my diamonds go to the
     pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
     you understand the cards?

               RODERICK
     I can play as soldiers do, but have
     no great skill.

               CHEVALIER
     We will practice in the mornings, my
     boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
     or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I carried my little reports to
     Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
     house outside the town where he gave
     me rendezvous.  These reports, of
     course, were arranged between me and
     the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
     instructed, and it is always the
     best way, to tell as much truth as
     my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

               RODERICK
     He goes to church regularly -- he is
     very religious, and after hearing
     mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
     he takes an airing in his chariot
     till dinner, which is served at
     noon.  After dinner, he writes his
     letters, if he has any letters to
     write; but he has very little to do
     in this way.  His letters are to the
     Austrian envoy, with whom he
     corresponds, but who does not
     acknowledge him; and being written
     in English, or course, I look over
     his shoulder.  He generally writes
     for money.  He makes his party with
     Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
     the Russian attaches, two from the
     English embassy, my lords Deuceace
     and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
     and a few more.  He wins often, but
     not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
     fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
     the English Minister, sometimes
     comes, on which occasion the
     secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was agreed that I should keep my
     character of valet, that in the
     presence of strangers I should not
     know a word of English, that I
     should keep good lookout on the
     trumps when I was serving the
     champagne and punch about; and,
     having a remarkably fine eyesight,
     and a great natural aptitude, I was
     speedily able to give my dear
     benefactor much assistance against
     his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Simplicity was our secret.
     Everything successful is simple.
     If, for instance, I wiped the dust
     off a chair with my napkin, it was
     to show that the enemy was strong in
     diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
     ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
     wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
     If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
     blew my nose, it was to indicate
     that there was another confederate
     employed by the adversary; and then,
     I warrant you, some pretty trials of
     skill would take place.  The Prince
     of Turbingen, although so young, had
     a very great skill and cleverness
     with the cards in every way; and it
     was only from hearing Ritter von
     Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
     three times when the Chevalier had
     the ace of trumps, that I knew we
     were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

               PRINCE
     Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
     I believe you have cheated me.

               CHEVALIER
     I deny your Grace's accusations, and
     beg you to say how you have been
     cheated?

               PRINCE
             (glaring at Roderick)
     I don't know.

               CHEVALIER
     Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
     frederics, which I have honorably
     won.

               PRINCE
     Chevalier, if you will have your
     money now, you must fight for it.
     If you will be patient, maybe I will
     pay you something another time.

               CHEVALIER
     Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
     take this, then I must give up an
     honorable and lucrative occupation.

               PRINCE
     I have said all there is to be said.
     I am at your disposal for whatever
     purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     Was he cheated?

               RODERICK
     In so far as I can tell these things
     -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
     the money fairly.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     Hmm-mmmm.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     What are the Chevalier's intentions?

               RODERICK
     I am not sure.  The Prince told him
     quite clearly that if he wished to
     have the money, he would have to
     fight for it.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     A meeting with the Prince of
     Turbingen is impossible.

               RODERICK
     The Prince left him only that
     choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     Will you be able to return here
     tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

               CHEVALIER
     Tell them I intend to demand
     satisfaction from the Prince.

               RODERICK
     But they will prevent a meeting at
     whatever the cost.

               CHEVALIER
     Have no fear.  It will come out well
     for me.

               RODERICK
     I believe they will deport you.

               CHEVALIER
     I have faced that problem before.

               RODERICK
     But, if they send you away, then
     what is to become of me?

               CHEVALIER
             (with a smile)
     Make your mind easy, you shall not
     be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
     take a last look at your barracks,
     make your mind easy, say a farewell
     to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
     souls, how they will weep when they
     hear you are out of the country,
     and, out of it, you shall go.

               RODERICK
     But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     The King has determined to send the
     Chevalier out of the country.

               RODERICK
     When is he to go?

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Has he sent the challenge yet?

               RODERICK
     Not yet, but I believe he intends
     to.

               MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
     Then this must be done tomorrow.

               RODERICK
     What is to be done?

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     You say he drives after breakfast
     and before dinner.  When he comes
     out to his carriage a couple of
     gendarmes will mount the box, and
     the coachman will get his orders to
     move on.

               RODERICK
     And his baggage?

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
     have a fancy to look into that red
     box which contains his papers, you
     say; and at noon, after parade,
     shall be at the inn.  You will not
     say a word to any one there
     regarding the affair, and will wait
     for me at the Chevalier's rooms
     until my arrival.  We must force
     that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
     or you would have got the key long
     ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     At ten o'clock the next morning, the
     carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
     Fast drew up as usual at the door of
     his hotel, and the Chevalier came
     down the stairs in his usual stately
     manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

               CHEVALIER
     Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
             (standing by the
              carriage)
     I will let down the steps for your
     honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

               CHEVALIER
     Good gracious!  What is this?

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
             (touching his hat)
     You are going to drive to the
     frontier.

               CHEVALIER
     It is shameful -- infamous!  I
     insist upon being put down at the
     Austrian ambassador's house.

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
     I have orders to gag your honor if
     you cry out, and to give you this
     purse containing ten thousand
     frederics if you do not.

               CHEVALIER
     Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
     owes me seventy thousand.

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
     Your honor must lower his voice.

               CHEVALIER
             (whispering)
     All Europe shall hear of this!

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
     As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
     Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
     only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Hearing the sound of the alarm
     cannon, the common people came out
     along the road, with fowling-pieces
     and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
     the truant.  The gendarmes looked
     very anxious to be on the lookout
     for him too.  The price of a
     deserter was fifty crowns to those
     who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

               CHEVALIER
     I have no luggage.

               PRUSSIAN OFFICER
     The gentleman has nothing
     contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

               CHEVALIER
     Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
     Will you please go to the house from
     whence we set out this morning, and
     tell my man there to send my baggage
     on to Three Kings at Dresden?

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Then ordering fresh horses, the
     Chevalier set off on his journey for
     that capital.  I need not tell you
     that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

               CHEVALIER (V.O.)
     From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
     Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
     Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
     Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
     Roderick -- This comes to you by a
     sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
     of the English mission, who is
     acquainted, as all Berlin will be
     directly, with our wonderful story.
     They only know half as yet; they
     only know that a deserter went off
     in my clothes, and all are in
     admiration of your cleverness and
     valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

               CHEVALIER (V.O.)
     As I lay in my bed two and a half
     hours after your departure, in comes
     your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
             (in his imperious
              Dutch manner)
     Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

               CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
     The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

               CHEVALIER (V.O.)
     Straightaway he makes for the red
     box where I keep my love letters, my
     glass eye which I used to wear, my
     two sets of Paris teeth, and my
     other private matters that you know
     of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
     but none of them fit the English
     lock.  Then he takes out of his
     pocket a chisel and hammer, and
     falls to work like a professional
     burglar, actually bursting open the
     little box!  Now was my time to act!
     I advance towards him armed with an
     immense water-jug.  I come
     noiselessly up to him just as he has
     broken the box, and, with all my
     might, I deal him such a blow over
     the head as smashes the water-jug to
     bits, and sends the captain with a
     snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
     I ring all the bells in the house;
     and shout, and swear, and scream,
     "Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
     -- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
     household comes tumbling up the
     stairs.

               CHEVALIER
     Where is my servant?  Who dares to
     rob me in open day?  Look at the
     villain whom I find in the act of
     breaking my chest open!  Send for
     the police, send for his Excellency
     the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
     shall know of this insult!

               LANDLORD
     Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
     three hours ago.

               CHEVALIER
     Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
     all morning.  I am ill -- I have
     taken physic -- I have not left the
     house this morning!  Where is that
     scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
     are my clothes and wig?

               CHAMBERMAID
     I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
     off in your honor's dress.

               CHEVALIER
     And my money -- my money!  Where is
     my purse with forty-eight frederics
     in it?  But we have one of the
     villains left, Officers, seize him.

               LANDLORD
             (more and more
              astonished)
     It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

               CHEVALIER
     What!  A gentleman breaking open my
     trunk with hammer and chisel --
     impossible!

               CHEVALIER (V.O.)
     Herr Galgenstein was returning to
     life by this time, with a swelling
     on his skull as big as a saucepan;
     and the officers carried him off,
     and, to make a long story short,
     poor Galgenstein is now on his way
     to Spandau; and his uncle, the
     Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
     brought me five hundred louis, with
     a humble request that I would leave
     Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
     painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
     particularly good order with the
     Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
     was, at this period, the most
     brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     He spent fabulous sums on the
     ballets and operas.  All the
     ballerinas were pretty, and they all
     boasted that they had all at least
     once made their amorous sovereign
     happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     There was not a party of the
     nobility to which the two Irish
     gentlemen were not invited, and
     admired, nor where we did not make
     the brave, the high-born and the
     beautiful talk to us.  There was no
     man in Europe more gay in spirits,
     more splendid in personal
     accomplishment, than young Roderick
     James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     What a delightful life did we now
     lead!  I knew I was born a
     gentleman, from the kindly way in
     which I took to the business, as
     business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     For though it seems all pleasure,
     yet I assure any low-bred persons
     who may chance to read this, that
     we, their betters, have to work as
     well as they; though I did not rise
     until noon, yet had I not been up at
     play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I came into it at once, and as if I
     had never done anything else all my
     life.  I had a gentleman to wait
     upon me, a French friseur to dress
     my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I knew the taste of chocolate as by
     intuition almost, and could
     distinguish between the right
     Spanish and the French before I had
     been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had rings on my fingers, watches
     in both my fobs, trinkets, and
     snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
     outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had the finest natural taste for
     lace and china of any man I ever
     knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I could judge a horse as well as any
     dealer in Germany.  I could not
     spell, but I could speak German and
     French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had at least twelve suits of
     clothes; three richly embroidered
     with gold, two laced with silver;
     one of French grey, silver-laced and
     lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
     morning robes, to which a peacock's
     tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
     skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I took lessons on the guitar, and
     sang French catches exquisitely.
     Where, in fact, was there a more
     accomplished gentleman than Roderick
     James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     How have we had the best blood, and
     the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
     throbbing round the table as I and
     the Chevalier have held the cards
     and the bank against some terrible
     player, who was matching some
     thousands out of his millions
     against our all which was there on
     the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Our principles were:  play grandly,
     honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
     down at losing; but, above all, be
     not eager at winning, as mean souls
     are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     When the Duke of Courland brought
     fourteen lackeys each with bags of
     florins, and challenged our bank to
     play against the sealed bags, what
     did we ask?

               CHEVALIER
     Sir, we have but eighty thousand
     florins in bank, or two hundred
     thousand at three months; if your
     highness' bags do not contain more
     than eight thousand, we will meet
     you.

Playing.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And we did, and after eleven hours
     play, in which our bank was at one
     time reduced to two hundred and
     three ducats, we won seventeen
     thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Nor need I mention my successes
     among the fairer portion of the
     creation.  One of the most
     accomplished, the tallest, the most
     athletic, and the handsomest
     gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
     a young fellow of my figure could
     not fail of having advantages, which
     a person of my spirit knew very well
     how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Dark Valdez.

               RODERICK
     Do you expect me to believe that
     your lover brought you here tonight?

               VALDEZ
     Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
     and he will call for me at midnight.

               RODERICK
     And he doesn't care about me?

               VALDEZ
     He is only curious to know who you
     are.

               RODERICK
     If his love were like mine, he would
     not permit you to come here.

               VALDEZ
     He loves me, as I love you.

               RODERICK
     Will he wish to know the details of
     this night?

               VALDEZ
     He will believe that it will please
     me if he asks about it, and I shall
     tell him everything except some
     circumstances which might humiliate
     him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

               LANGEAC
     I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

               LANGEAC
     There you are, dressed by my hand.
     It is nearly the same thing; but
     despite the fineness and
     transparency of the skin, the little
     fellow pleases me less well in
     costume.  It seems that this
     covering degrades him, or degrades
     me -- one of the other.

               RODERICK
     Both, my angel.  It was Love who
     invented these little jackets:  for
     he had to ally himself with
     Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

               COUNT
     I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
     moment for you; it seems that you
     love this lady.

               RODERICK
     Certainly, monseigneur, does not
     Your Excellency consider her worthy
     of love?

               COUNT
     Perfectly so; and what is more, I
     will tell you that I love her, and
     that I am not of a humor to put up
     with rivals.

               RODERICK
     Very well!  Now that I know it, I
     will no longer love her.

               COUNT
     Then you yield to me.

               RODERICK
     On the instant.  Everyone must yield
     to such a nobleman as you.

               COUNT
     Very well; but a man who yields
     takes to his legs.

               RODERICK
     That is a trifle strong.

               COUNT
     Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

               RODERICK
     Your Excellency has wantonly
     insulted me.  That being so, I
     conclude that you hate me,
     Monseigneur, and that hence you
     would be glad to remove me from the
     number of the living.  In this wish,
     I can and will satisfy Your
     Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was my unrivaled skill with
     sword and pistol, and readiness to
     use them, that maintained the
     reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

               DASCHER
     I see that you are without your
     sword, but I believe you are a man
     of mettle.  Will you give me
     satisfaction?

               RODERICK
     I shall be delighted; but you have
     lost and you must pay me the money
     before we meet, for, after all, you
     cannot pay me when you are dead.

               ANOTHER OFFICER
     I will undertake to pay you the 20
     louis, but only tomorrow morning at
     the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

               DASCHER
     I may have been mistaken, but I mean
     to make you pay deadly for your
     brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

               RODERICK
             (privately)
     It is distasteful to kill a
     scoundrel -- that should be work for
     a hangman.

               CHEVALIER
     To risk one's life against such
     people is an imposition.

               RODERICK
             (laughs)
     I risk nothing, for I am certain to
     kill him.

               CHEVALIER
     Certain?

               RODERICK
     Perfectly certain, because I shall
     make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

               RODERICK
     You have only to pace yourself at
     ten paces difference, and fire
     first.  The space between these two
     trees is the place where I choose to
     walk back and forth.  You may walk
     too, if you wish, when it is my turn
     to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

               DASCHER
     But we must decide who is to have
     the first shot.

               RODERICK
     There is no need of that.  I never
     fire first; and, in any case, you
     have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

               RODERICK
             (with the greatest
              composure)
     You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
     would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Thus is will be seen that our life,
     for all its splendor was one of
     extreme difficulty and danger,
     requiring high talents and courage
     for success, and sudden and
     unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

               RODERICK
     I am posting, monsieur, and
     furthermore I am a foreigner.

               STRANGER
     Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
     has no special right, and if you are
     a foreigner, you must admit that you
     have no greater claim than mine,
     since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The ladies were passionately fond of
     play, and hence would often arise no
     small trouble to us; for the truth
     most be told, that the ladies loved
     to play, but not to pay.  The point
     of honor is not understood by the
     charming sex; and it was with the
     greatest difficulty that we could
     keep them from the table, could get
     their money if they lost or, if they
     paid, prevent them from using the
     most furious and extraordinary means
     of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     On this evening, the lady of high
     rank, after I had won a considerable
     sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
     sent her lover with a band of cut-
     throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     After making suitable arrangements
     for the Chevalier's burial, in
     proper accord with his church, I
     traveled to Spa, which was now in
     season, alone, to continue my
     profession which formerly had the
     support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was by this time one of the best-
     known characters in Europe; and the
     fame of my exploits, my duels, my
     courage at play, would bring crowds
     round me in any public society where
     I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The passion for play is stronger
     than the passion for gallantry; the
     gamester at Spa has neither time to
     stop to consider the merits of a
     woman, nor the courage to make
     sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     In evoking the recollections of
     these days, I have nothing but
     pleasure.  I would if I could say as
     much of a lady who will henceforth
     play a considerable part in the
     drama of my life -- I mean the
     Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
     acquaintance I made at Spa, very
     soon after the tragic events which
     caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
     Countess and a Viscountess in her
     own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She was the wife of her cousin, the
     Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
     Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
     Minister to George II and George III
     of several of the smaller courts of
     Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She was the mother to Viscount
     Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
     little boy, about whom his father
     was more than indifferent, and whom
     his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I made Sir William Cosgrove's
     acquaintance as usual at the play-
     table.  One could not but admire the
     spirit and gallantry with which he
     pursued his favorite pastime; for,
     though worn out with gout and a
     myriad of diseases, a cripple
     wheeled about in a chair, and
     suffering pangs of agony, yet you
     would see him every morning, and
     every evening at his post behind the
     delightful green cloth.

               SIR WILLIAM
     Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
     have no more manners than a barber,
     and I think my black footman has
     been better educated than you; but
     you are a young fellow of
     originality and pluck, and I like
     you, sir.  because you seem
     determined to go to the devil by a
     way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

               RODERICK
     I am obliged to observe, Sir William
     Cosgrove, that since you are bound
     for the next world much sooner than
     I am, I will depend on you to get
     comfortable quarters arranged for
     me.

Laughter.

               SIR WILLIAM
     Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
     me.  Marriage has added forty years
     to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
     cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
     I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
     no man of my years who looked so
     young as myself.  Fool that I was!
     I had enough with my pensions,
     perfect freedom, the best society in
     Europe -- and I gave up all these,
     and married and was miserable.  Take
     a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
     stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
     but marry.

               RODERICK
     Would you have me spend my life all
     alone?

               SIR WILLIAM
     In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
     marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

               RODERICK
             (laughing)
     The milkmaid's daughter?

               SIR WILLIAM
     Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
     No man of sense need restrict
     himself or deny himself a single
     amusement for his wife's sake; on
     the contrary, if he selects the
     animal properly, he will choose such
     a one as shall be no bar to his
     pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
     of annoyance.  For instance, I have
     got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
     valet who robs me whenever he has
     the power.  My wife never comes near
     me.  What friend have I?  None in
     the wide world.  Men of the world,
     as you and I are, don't make
     friends, and we are fools for our
     pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

               SIR WILLIAM
     My lady is a weak woman, but she is
     my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
     has got the better of one of the
     best heads in Christendom.  She is
     enormously rich, but somehow I have
     never been so poor, as since I
     married her.  I thought to better
     myself, and she has made me
     miserable and killed me, and she
     will do as much for my successor
     when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

               RODERICK
     Has her ladyship a very large
     income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Despite my friend's strong warning.
     I resolves to become acquainted with
     his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
     dying.  His widow would be a rich
     prize.  Why should I not win her,
     and, with her, the means of making
     in the world that figure which my
     genius and inclination desired?
     When I determine, I look upon the
     thing as done.

               RODERICK
     Charming lady, tell me the truth and
     earn my gratitude.  Have you a
     lover?

The countess laughs.

               COUNTESS
     No.

               RODERICK
     Have you had one?

               COUNTESS
     Never.

               RODERICK
     But, for a time... a passing fancy?

               COUNTESS
     Not even that.

               RODERICK
     How can I believe that there is not
     a man who has inspired desires in
     you?

               COUNTESS
     Not one.

               RODERICK
     Have you not a man whom you value?

               COUNTESS
     That man has, perhaps, not yet been
     born.

               RODERICK
     What!  You have not met a man worthy
     of your attention?

               COUNTESS
     Many worthy of attention; but
     valuing is something more.  I could
     value only someone whom I loved.

               RODERICK
     Then you have never loved?  Your
     heart is empty.

               COUNTESS
     Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
     Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
     it is fortunate, I congratulate
     myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
     not care, for I am not aware of it.

               RODERICK
     It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
     you will know it when you love.

               COUNTESS
     But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
     will know that my empty heart was my
     good fortune.

               RODERICK
     That is true, but it seems to me
     impossible that you should be
     unhappy in love.

               COUNTESS
     It is only too possible.  Love
     requires a mutual harmony which is
     difficult, and it is even more
     difficult to make it last.

               RODERICK
     I agree; but God put us on earth to
     take that risk.

               COUNTESS
     A man may need to do that, and find
     it amusing; but a girl is bound by
     other laws.

               RODERICK
     I believe you, and I see I must
     hasten to leave, for otherwise I
     shall become the unhappiest of men.

               COUNTESS
     How so?

               RODERICK
     By loving you, with no hope of
     possessing you.

She laughs.

               COUNTESS
     You want my heart?

               RODERICK
     It is my only object.

               COUNTESS
     To make me wretched in two weeks.

               RODERICK
     To love you until death.  To
     subscribe to all your commands.

               COUNTESS
     The amusing thing is that you
     deceive me without knowing, if it is
     true that you love me.

               RODERICK
     Deceiving someone without knowing it
     is something new for me.  If I do
     not know it, I am innocent.

               COUNTESS
     But you deceive me nonetheless if I
     believe you, for it will not be in
     your power to love me when you love
     me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

               COUNTESS
     Be so good as to tell me with whom
     you think you are?

               RODERICK
     With a woman who is completely
     charming, be she a princess or a
     woman of the lowest condition, and
     who, regardless of her rank, will
     show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

               COUNTESS
     And if she does not choose to show
     you some kindness?

               RODERICK
     Then I will respectfully take leave
     of her.

               COUNTESS
     You will do as you please.  It seems
     to me that such a matter can hardly
     be discussed until after people know
     each other.  Do you not agree?

               RODERICK
     Yes -- but I am afraid of being
     deceived.

               COUNTESS
     Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
     want to begin where people end?

               RODERICK
     I ask only a payment on account
     today -- after that, you will find
     me undemanding, obedient and
     discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

               RODERICK
     Will we always leave it at this?

               COUNTESS
     Always, my dear one, never any
     further.  Love is a child to be
     pacified with trifles.  A full diet
     can only kill it.

               RODERICK
     I know better than you do.  Love
     wants a more substantial fare, and
     if it is stubbornly withheld, it
     withers away.

               COUNTESS
     Our abstinence makes our love
     immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
     of an hour ago, now I should love
     you even more.  But I should love
     you less if you exhausted my joy by
     satisfying all my desires.

               RODERICK
     Let us give each other complete
     happiness, and let us be sure that
     as many times as we satisfy our
     desires, they will each time be born
     anew.

               COUNTESS
     My husband has convinced me of the
     contrary.

               RODERICK
     Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
     dying, and yet I envy him more than
     any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
     privilege of which I am deprived.
     He may take you in his arms whenever
     he pleases, and no veil keeps his
     senses, his eyes, his soul from
     enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

               COUNTESS
     Shall I tell you something -- I
     believed what was called love came
     after the union -- and I was
     surprised when my husband, making me
     a woman, made me know it only by
     pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
     I saw that my imaginings had stood
     me in better stead.  And so we
     became only friends, seldom sleeping
     together and arousing no curiosity
     in each other, yet on good terms for
     a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
     was at his service, but since the
     offering was not seasoned with love,
     he found it tasteless, and seldom
     demanded it.

               RODERICK
     O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
     you.  Stop believing in your
     experience.  You have never known
     love.  My very soul is leaving me!
     Catch it on your lips, and give me
     yours!

They kiss ardently.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     To make a long story short, her
     ladyship and I were in love six
     hours after we met; and after I once
     got into her ladyship's good graces,
     I found innumerable occasions to
     improve my intimacy, and was
     scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I shall never forget the
     astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
     when, on one summer evening, as he
     was issuing out to the play-table,
     in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
     barouche and four came driving into
     the courtyard of the house which
     they inhabited and, in that
     carriage, by her ladyship's side,
     sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
     adventurer," as she was pleased to
     call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

               COUNTESS
     Without you, my dearest, I might
     have died without ever knowing love.
     Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
     Bitterness than which nothing is
     sweeter, sweetness than which
     nothing is more bitter.  Divine
     monster which can only be defined by
     paradoxes.

               RODERICK
     Let me give a thousand kisses to
     that heavenly mouth which has told
     me that I am happy.

               COUNTESS
     As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
     pleased, and I gave you every
     opportunity to fall more in love
     with me, being certain that, for my
     part, I would never love you.  But
     after our first kiss, I found that I
     had no power over myself.  I did not
     know that one kiss could matter so
     much.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We then spent an hour in the most
     eloquent silence except that, from
     time to time, her ladyship cried
     out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
     am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Sir William Cosgrove, with his
     complication of ills, was dying
     before us by inches.  He was
     continually tinkered up by doctors,
     and, what with my usual luck, he
     might be restored to health and live
     I don't know how many years.  If
     Cosgrove would not die, where was
     the use of my pursing his lady?  But
     my fears were to prove groundless,
     for on that very night, patient
     nature would claim her account.

               SIR WILLIAM
     Good evening, Mr. James, have you
     done with my lady?

               RODERICK
     I beg your pardon?

               SIR WILLIAM
     Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
     would rather be known as a cuckold
     than a fool.

               RODERICK
     I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
     have had too much drink.  Your
     chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
     into the company of your lady to
     advise me on a religious matter, of
     which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

               SIR WILLIAM
     Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
     He has been troubled by religious
     scruples, and has flown for refuge
     to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
     asked for advise from my wife, Lady
     Cosgrove, and between them both,
     they are confirming my ingenious
     young friend in his faith.  Did you
     ever hear of such doctors and such a
     disciple?

               RODERICK
     Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
     principles, it's surely better I
     should apply for them to your lady,
     and your chaplin than to you?

               SIR WILLIAM
             (laughing, but pretty
              red)
     He wants to step into my shoes!  He
     wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

               RODERICK
     Well, if my intentions are what you
     think they are -- if I do wish to
     step into your shoes, what then?  I
     have no other intentions than you
     had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
     wealth may be great, but am I not of
     a generous nature enough to use it
     worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
     not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
     be sworn to muster just as much
     regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
     ever showed her; and if I win her,
     and wear her when you are dead and
     gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
     that it will be the fear of your
     ghost will deter me?

               SIR WILLIAM
     Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
     me, as I am drawing near the goal,
     to find my home such a happy one; my
     wife so fond of me, that she is even
     now thinking of appointing a
     successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
     see her; like a prudent housewife,
     getting everything ready for her
     husband's departure?

               RODERICK
     I hope that you are not thinking of
     leaving us soon, knight?

               SIR WILLIAM
     Not so soon, my dear, as you may
     fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
     been given over many times these
     four years, and there was always a
     candidate or two waiting to apply
     for the situation.  Who knows how
     long I may keep you waiting.

               RODERICK
     Sir, let those laugh that win.

               SIR WILLIAM
     I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
     grieved to keep you or any gentleman
     waiting.  Had you not better to
     arrange with my doctor or get the
     cook to flavor my omelette with
     arsenic?  What are the odds,
     gentlemen, that I don't live to see
     Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

               VOICE
     Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
     Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
     William Cosgrove, Knight of the
     Bath, Member of Parliament for
     Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
     years His Majesty's representative
     at various European courts.  He hath
     left behind him a name which is
     endeared to all his friends for his
     manifold virtues and talents, a
     reputation justly acquired in the
     service of His Majesty, and an
     inconsolable widow to deplore his
     loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     A year from that day, on the
     fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
     I had the honor and happiness to
     lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
     of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
     Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
     I had procured His Majesty's
     gracious permission to add the name
     of my lovely lady to my own, and,
     henceforward, assumed the title of
     James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

               COUNTESS
     My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
     your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

               BROOKSIDE
     He, my father!  I would as soon call
     one of your ladyship's footmen,
     papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

               COUNTESS
     Lord Brookside, you have offended
     your father.

               BROOKSIDE
     Mother, you have offended my father.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was a declaration of war to me,
     as I saw at once; though I declare I
     was willing enough to have lived
     with him on terms of friendliness.
     But as men serve me, I serve them.
     Who can blame me for my after-
     quarrels with this young reprobate,
     or lay upon my shoulders the evils
     which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     After we had received the
     congratulations of our friends in
     London -- I and Victoria set off to
     visit our country estate, Castle
     Hackton, where I had never as yet
     set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The first days of a marriage are
     commonly very trying; and I have
     known couples, who lived together
     like turtle-doves for the rest of
     their lives, peck each other's eyes
     out almost during the honeymoon.  I
     did not escape the common lot.  In
     our journey westwards, my Lady
     Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
     because I had pulled out a pipe of
     tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
     haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
     I promise you that, in this instant,
     I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had not arrived at the pitch of
     prosperity, and having, at thirty
     years of age, by my own merits and
     energy, raised myself to one of the
     highest social positions that any
     man in England could occupy, I
     determined to enjoy myself as
     becomes a man of quality for the
     remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But it was not meant for me to
     finish my life as a man of quality
     and position.  Indeed, I am one of
     those born clever enough at gaining
     a fortune, but incapable of keeping
     one; for the qualities and energy,
     which lead a man to accept the
     first, are often the very causes of
     his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
     I know of no other reason for the
     misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     At the end of the year, Lady
     Cosgrove presented me with a son;
     Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
     compliment to my royal ancestry, but
     what more had I to leave him than a
     noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We spent the season in London at our
     house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Her ladyship and I lived, for a
     while, pretty separate when in
     London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
     say the truth, I preferred it, being
     a great friend to a modest, tranquil
     behavior in woman and a taste for
     the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Besides, she was a mother, and had
     great comfort in the dressing,
     educating, and dandling of our
     little Patrick for whose sake it was
     fit that she should give up the
     pleasures and frivolities of the
     world; so she left that part of the
     duty of every family of distinction
     to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Her ladyship's conversations with me
     were characterized by a stupid
     despair, or a silly blundering
     attempt at forced cheerfulness,
     still more disagreeable; hence, our
     intercourse was but trifling, and my
     temptations to carry her into the
     world or to remain in her society of
     necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She would try my temper, at home,
     too, in a thousand ways.  When
     requested by me to entertain the
     company with conversation, wit, and
     learning, of which she was a
     mistress; or music, of which she was
     an accomplished performer, she
     would, as often as not, begin to
     cry, and leave the room.  My company
     from this, of course, fancied I was
     a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
     only a severe and careful guardian
     of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
     minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Despite the utter distaste with
     which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
     and, although I took no particular
     pains to disguise my feelings in
     general, yet she was of such a mean
     spirit that she pursued me with her
     regard, and would kindle up at the
     smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And, in these fits of love, she was
     the most easy creature in the world
     to be persuaded, and would have
     signed away her whole property, had
     it been possible.  And, I must
     confess, it was with very little
     attention on my part that I could
     bring her into good humor, and, up
     to the very last day of our being
     together, would be reconciled to me,
     and fondle me, if I addressed her a
     single kind word.  Such is female
     inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She was luckily very fond of her
     youngest son, and through him I had
     a wholesome and effectual hold on
     her; for if in any of her tantrums
     or fits of haughtiness, she
     pretended to have the upper-hand, to
     assert her authority against mine,
     to refuse to sign such papers as I
     might think necessary for the
     distribution of our large and
     complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I would have Master Patrick carried
     off to Chiswick for a couple of
     days; and I warrant me his lady-
     mother could hold out no longer and
     would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
     more than fashionable people do, and,
     for the first three years, I never
     struck my wife but when I was in
     liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     When I flung the carving-knife at
     Brookside, I was drunk, as
     everybody present can testify, but
     as for having any systematic scheme
     against the poor lad, I can declare
     solemnly that, beyond merely hating
     him, I am guilty of no evil towards
     him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Do what one would to please her, my
     lady would never be happy or in good
     humor.  And soon she added a mean,
     detestable jealousy to all her other
     faults, and would weep and wring her
     hands, and threaten to commit
     suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Her death would have been no comfort
     to me, as I leave any person of
     common prudence to imagine; for that
     scoundrel of a young Brookside who
     was about to become my greatest
     plague and annoyance, would have
     inherited every penny of the
     property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Humble people envy us great men, and
     fancy that our lives are all
     pleasure.  But the troubles of
     poverty, the rascality of agents,
     the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
     My life at this period seemed to
     consist of nothing but drafts of
     letters and money-brokers relative
     to the raising of money, and the
     insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
     and innumerable correspondence with
     upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
     horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
     stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
     five years old, and was the most
     polite and engaging child ever seen;
     it was a pleasure to treat him with
     kindness and distinction; the little
     fellow was the pink of fashion,
     beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
     he could not have been otherwise,
     with the care both his parents
     bestowed upon him, and the
     attentions which were lavished upon
     him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Whereas, young Brookside had grown
     to be a very nasty and disrespectful
     fellow indeed.  In my company, he
     preserved the most rigid silence,
     and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
     which was so much the more
     disagreeable because there was
     nothing in his behavior I could
     actually take hold of to find fault
     with, although his whole conduct was
     insolent and supercilious to the
     highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     In addition to this, the lad was
     fond of spending the chief part of
     his time occupied with the musty old
     books, which he took out of the
     library, and which I hate to see a
     young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The insubordination of that boy was
     dreadful.  He used to quote passages
     of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
     made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     As it is best to nip vice in the
     bud, and for a master of a family to
     exercise his authority in such a
     manner as that there may be no
     question about it, I took every
     opportunity of coming to close
     quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     He always chose the days when
     company, or the clergy, or gentry of
     the neighborhood were present, to
     make violent, sarcastic, and
     insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

               BROOKSIDE
     Dear child, what a pity it is I am
     not dead for your sake!  The
     Cosgroves would then have a worthy
     representative, and enjoy all the
     benefits of the illustrious blood of
     the James' of Duganstown, would they
     not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

               MOTHER
     Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
     that my darling boy has attained a
     position I always knew was his due,
     and for which I pinched myself to
     educate him.  Little Patrick is a
     darling boy, and you live in great
     splendor, but how long will it last?
     Your lady-wife knows she has a
     treasure she couldn't have had, had
     she taken a duke to marry her, but
     if, one day, she should tire of my
     wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
     Irish ways, or if she should die,
     what future would there be for my
     son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

               MOTHER
     You have not a penny of your own,
     and cannot transact any business
     without the Countess' signature.
     Upon her death, the entire estate
     would go to young Brookside, who
     bears you little affection.  You
     could be penniless tomorrow, and
     darling Patrick at the mercy of his
     stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

               MOTHER
     I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
     not rest until I see you Earl of
     Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
     Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

               MOTHER
     This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

               MOTHER
     These things entail considerable
     expense, and you will need your
     lady's blessing, but the young boy
     forms the great bond of union
     between you and her ladyship, and
     there is no plan of ambition you
     could propose in which she would not
     join for the poor lad's benefit, and
     no expense she will not eagerly
     incur, if it might be any means be
     shown to tend to his advancement.
     You have important friends, and they
     can tell you how these things are
     done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And, to be sure, I did know someone
     who knew precisely how these things
     were done, and this was the
     distinguished solicitor and former
     Government Minister, Lord West,
     whose acquaintance I made, as I had
     so many others, at the gaming table.

               LORD WEST
     Do you happen to know Gustavus
     Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
     Crabs?

               RODERICK
     By name only.

               LORD WEST
     Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
     the gentlemen of His Majesty's
     closet, and one with whom our
     revered monarch is on terms of
     considerable intimacy.  I should say
     you would be wise to fix upon this
     nobleman your chief reliance for the
     advancement of your claim to the
     Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
     paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
     kindly arranged a meeting with that
     old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
     Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
     Crabs.

               EARL OF CRABS
     Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
     person, he or she is safe.  There is
     no question about them any more.  My
     friends are the best people.  I
     don't mean the most virtuous, or,
     indeed, the least virtuous, or the
     cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
     richest, or the best born, but the
     "best" -- in a word, people about
     whom there is no question.  I cannot
     promise you how long it will take.
     You can appreciate it is not an easy
     matter.  But any gentlemen with an
     estate, and ten-thousand a-year
     should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The striving after this peerage, I
     consider to have been one of the
     most unlucky dealings at this
     period.  I made unheard of
     sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
     tell you bribes were administered,
     and in high places too -- so near
     the royal person of His Majesty that
     you would be astonished were I to
     mention what great personages
     condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I lavished money here, and diamonds
     there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I bought lands at ten times there
     value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I gave repeated entertainments to
     those friends to my claims who,
     being about the royal person, were
     likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I purchased pictures and articles of
     vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I lost many a bet to the royal
     dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     One of the main causes of expense
     which this ambition of mine entailed
     upon me was the fitting out and
     arming of a company of infantry from
     the Hackton estates, which I offered
     to my gracious sovereign for the
     campaign against the American
     rebels.  These troops, superbly
     equipped and clothed, were embarked
     at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And the patriotism of the gentlemen
     who raised them was so acceptable at
     court that, on being presented by my
     Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
     to notice me particularly and said:

               GEORGE III
     That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
     another company, and go with them,
     too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Crabs was really one of the most
     entertaining fellows in the world,
     and I took a sincere pleasure in his
     company, besides the interest and
     desire I had in cultivating the
     society of the most important
     personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

               JOHNSON
     If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
     should mind my horses and tailors
     and not trouble myself about
     letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

               RODERICK
     Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
     most grossly, treating my opinions
     with no more respect than those of a
     schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
     a great deal more than me, because
     you quote your "Aristotle" and
     "Plato," but can you tell me which
     horse will win at Epsom Downs next
     week?  Can you shoot the ace of
     spades ten times without missing?
     If so, talk about Aristotle and
     Plato with me.

               BOSWELL
             (roars)
     Do you know who you're speaking to?!

               JOHNSON
     Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
     no right to brag of my Greek,
     gentlemen, and he has answered me
     very well.

               RODERICK
             (pleased)
     Do you know ever a rhyme for
     Aristotle?

               GOLDSMITH
             (laughing)
     Port, if you please.

               JOHNSON
     Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
     rhymes for Aristotle.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
     before we left the coffee house that
     evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

               EARL OF CRABS
     Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
     who wishes to arrange a dinner party
     next week for sixty guests.

               HENRI
     I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
     How much do you wish to spend?

               RODERICK
     As much as possible.

               HENRI
     As much as possible?

               RODERICK
     Yes, for I wish to entertain
     splendidly.

               HENRI
     All the same, you must name an
     amount.

               RODERICK
     It is entirely up to you.  I want
     the best.

               EARL OF CRABS
     May I suggest five hundred guineas?

               RODERICK
     Will that be enough?

               HENRI
     Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
     spent no more.

               RODERICK
     All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The life I was leading was that of a
     happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

               PATRICK
     Papa, please don't flog Brookside
     today.  It wasn't his fault --
     really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     By now, young Brookside was of so
     wild, savage, and insubordinate a
     nature that I never had the least
     regard for him.  As he grew up to be
     a man, his hatred for me assumed an
     intensity quite wicked to think of
     and which, I promise you, I returned
     with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

               BROOKSIDE
             (grinding his teeth)
     Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
     from this moment on, I will submit
     to no further chastisement from you!
     Do you understand that?

               RODERICK
     Give me that pistol.

               BROOKSIDE
     Take heed, Mister James.  I will
     shoot you if you lay hands on me
     now, or ever again.  Is that
     entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I decided, at once, to give up that
     necessary part of his education.
     In truth, he then became the most
     violent, daring, disobedient,
     scapegrace, that ever caused an
     affectionate parent pain; he was
     certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
     attempted to punish my Lord
     Brookside; but I promise you the
     rogue was too strong for him, and
     leveled the Oxford man to the
     ground with a chair, greatly to the
     delight of little Patrick, who cried
     out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
     thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     With the child, Brookside was,
     strange to say, pretty tractable.
     He took a liking to the little
     fellow -- I like him the more, he
     said, because he was "half a
     Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Another day, it was Patrick's
     birthday, we were giving a grand
     ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
     time for my Patrick to make his
     appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

               BROOKSIDE
             (very loudly)
     Don't you think he fits my shoes
     very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

               COUNTESS
     From the manner in which I love this
     child, my lord, you ought to know
     how I would have loved his elder
     brother, had he proved worthy of any
     mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

               BROOKSIDE
     Madam, I have borne as long as
     mortal could endure the ill-
     treatment of the insolent Irish
     upstart, whom you have taken into
     your bed.  It is not only the
     lowness of his birth, and the
     general brutality of his manners
     which disgusts me, but the shameful
     nature of his conduct towards your
     ladyship, his brutal and
     ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
     infidelity, his habits of
     extravagance, intoxication, his
     shameless robberies and swindling of
     my property and yours.  It is these
     insults to you which shock and annoy
     me more than the ruffian's infamous
     conduct to myself.  I would have
     stood by your ladyship, as I
     promised, but you seem to have taken
     latterly your husband's part; and,
     as I cannot personally chastise this
     low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
     be it spoken, is the husband of my
     mother, and as I cannot bear to
     witness his treatment of you, and
     loathe his horrible society as if it
     were the plague, I am determined to
     quit my native country, at least
     during his detested life, or during
     my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     If I had murdered my lord, I could
     scarcely have been received with
     more shameful obloquy and slander
     than now followed me in town and
     country.  My friends fell away from
     me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
     to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My reception at court was scarcely
     more cordial.  On paying my respects
     to my sovereign at St. James, His
     Majesty pointedly asked me when I
     had news of Lord Brookside.  On
     which I replied, with no ordinary
     presence of mind:

               RODERICK
     Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
     to fight the rebels against Your
     Majesty's crown in America.  Does
     Your Majesty desire that I should
     send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

               DUKE OF RUTLAND
             (speaking very
              quietly)
     Let me tell you, sir, that your
     conduct has been very odiously
     represented to the King, and has
     formed the subject of royal comment.
     The King has said, influenced by
     these representations, that you are
     the most disreputable man in the
     three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
     your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

               DUKE OF RUTLAND
     Hear me out, please.  It has been
     intimated to His Majesty that you
     had raised the American Company for
     the sole purpose of getting the
     young Viscount to command it, and so
     get rid of him.  And, further, that
     you had paid the very man in the
     company, who was ordered to dispatch
     him in the first general action.

               RODERICK
     Thus it is that my loyalty is
     rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
     of my country viewed!

               DUKE OF RUTLAND
     As for your ambitious hopes
     regarding the Irish peerages, His
     Majesty has also let it be known
     that you have been led astray by
     that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
     money, but who has no more influence
     to get a coronet than to procure a
     Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
     in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
     will be disappointed.  He left for
     the continent on Tuesday, and may be
     away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

               RODERICK
     I insist upon being allowed to
     appear before His Majesty and clear
     myself of the imputations against
     me, to point out my services to the
     government, and to ask when the
     reward, that had been promised me,
     the title held by my ancestors, is
     again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

               LORD WEST
             (gently)
     Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

               RODERICK
     Yes!

               LORD WEST
     Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
     point by point.  The King is
     exceedingly averse to make peers, as
     you know.  Your claim, as you call
     them, have been laid before him, and
     His Majesty's gracious reply was,
     that you were the most impudent man
     in his dominions, and merited a
     halter, rather than a coronet.  As
     for withdrawing your support from
     us, you are perfectly welcome to
     carry yourself whithersoever you
     please.  And, now, as I have a great
     deal of occupation, perhaps you will
     do me the favor to retire, or tell
     me if there is anything else in the
     world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The news of His Majesty's disregard
     were not long in getting around,
     and, in a very short time, all the
     bills came down upon me together --
     all the bills I had been contracting
     for the years of my marriage.  I
     won't cite their amount; it was
     frightful.  I was bound up in an
     inextricable toil of bills and
     debts, or mortgages and insurances,
     and all the horrible evils attendant
     upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Was it my own want of style, or my
     want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
     I was arrived at the height of my
     ambition, but both my skill and my
     luck seemed to be deserting me.
     Everything I touched, crumbled in my
     hands; every speculation I had,
     failed; every agent I trusted,
     deceived me.  My income was saddled
     with hundreds of annuities, and
     thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
     felt the net drawing closer and
     closer around me, and no means to
     extricate myself from its toils.
     All my schemes had turned out
     failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My wife's moody despondency made my
     house and home not over-pleasant;
     hence, I was driven a good deal
     abroad, where as play was the
     fashion in every club, tavern, and
     assembly, I, of course, was obliged
     to resume my old habit, and to
     commence as an amateur those games
     at which I was once unrivaled in
     Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
     was forced to meet my losses by the
     most shameful sacrifices to the
     money-lenders, and was compelled to
     borrow largely upon my wife's
     annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
     life, which was the condition for
     every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

               BROKER
     Your wife's life is as well known
     among the insurance societies in
     London, as any woman in Christendom,
     and, I'm sorry to say there is not
     one of them willing to place another
     policy against her ladyship's life.
     One of them even had the impudence
     to suggest that your treatment of
     the Countess did not render her life
     worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     In the midst of my difficulties, I
     promised to buy a little horse for
     my dear little Patrick, which was to
     be a present for his eighth
     birthday, that was now coming on.  I
     may have had my faults, but no man
     shall dare to say of me that I was
     not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was a beautiful little animal,
     and stood me in a good sum.  I never
     regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But the horse was a bit wild, and he
     kicked off one of the horse-boys who
     rode him at first, and broke the
     lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     But he was a beautiful animal and
     would make a fine horse for Patrick
     after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

               RODERICK
     Timmy, take the injured lad to see
     the doctor, and then bring the horse
     to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
     break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
     it's for little Patrick, and that
     I'll be over to see him next week.

               HORSE-BOY
     Yes, sir.

               RODERICK
     One more thing, and listen well, I
     don't want little Patrick to know
     where the horse is being kept.  It's
     going to be surprise for his
     birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

               PATRICK
     Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

               PATRICK
     Did you buy the horse, papa?

               RODERICK
     Now, just have a little patience, my
     boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
     week.

               PATRICK
     But I will have it on my birthday,
     won't I?

               RODERICK
     Well, we'll just have to wait and
     see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
     a prince; his breeding and manners,
     even at his early age, showed him to
     be worthy of the two noble families
     from whom he was descended, and I
     don't know what high hopes I had for
     the boy, and indulged in a thousand
     fond anticipations as to his future
     success and figure in the world, but
     stern Fate had determined that I
     should leave none of my race behind
     me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

               PATRICK
             (kissing him)
     Good night, papa.

               RODERICK
     Good night, my little darling.

               PATRICK
     Papa?

               RODERICK
     Yes?

               PATRICK
     One of the boys in the stable told
     Nelly that you've already bought my
     horse, and that it's at Doolan's
     farm, where Mick the groom is
     breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

               RODERICK
             (angered)
     What the devil?  What kind of fools
     do we have here?  Pottle, who told
     the lad this story?

               HUNT
     I don't know, sir.

               PATRICK
     Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
     thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

               COUNTESS
     Promise me, Patrick, that you will
     not ride the horse except in the
     company of your father.

               PATRICK
             (unconvincingly)
     I promise, mama.

               RODERICK
     I promise your lordship a good
     flogging if you even so much as go
     to Doolan's farm to see him.

               PATRICK
     Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

               RODERICK
     Yes...?

               VALET
     I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
     Mr. Hunt has something important to
     tell you.

               RODERICK
     Yes?

               HUNT
     I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
     your orders and stolen off to
     Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
     lad's room this morning, his bed was
     empty.  One of the cooks said she
     saw him go away before daybreak.  He
     must have slipped through my room
     while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

               PATRICK
     You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The doctors were called, but what
     does a doctor avail in a contest
     with the grim, invincible enemy?
     Such as came could only confirm our
     despair by their account of the poor
     child's case.  His spine was
     injured, the lower half of him was
     dead when they laid him in bed at
     home.  The rest did not last long,
     God help me!  He remained yet for
     two days with us, and a sad comfort
     it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

               PATRICK
             (weakly)
     Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
     me for any acts of disobedience I
     have been guilty of towards you.

               COUNTESS
             (weeping)
     Oh, my little angel, you have done
     nothing for which you need pardon.

               PATRICK
     Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
     see him.

               RODERICK
     Your bother is in America fighting
     the rebels.

               PATRICK
     Is he all right, papa?

               RODERICK
     Yes, he's fine.

               PATRICK
     Brooksy was better than you, papa,
     he used not to swear so, and he
     taught me many good things while you
     were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

               PATRICK
     I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
     love each other, so that we might
     meet again in heaven where Brooksy
     told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     At last, after two days, he died.
     There he lay, the hope of my family,
     the pride of my manhood, the link
     which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
     together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I won't tell you with what splendor
     we buried him, but what avail are
     undertakers' feathers and heralds'
     trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
     nervous, after our blessed boy's
     catastrophe, became more agitated
     than ever, and plunged into devotion
     with so much fervor that you would
     have fancied her almost distracted
     at times.

Countess sees visions.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She imagined she saw visions.  She
     said an angel from heaven told her
     that Patrick's death was a
     punishment to her for her neglect of
     her firstborn.  Then she would
     declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     By now, my financial affairs were
     near to ruin.  I could not get a
     guinea from any money-dealer in
     London.  Our rents were in the hands
     of receivers by this time, and it
     was as much as I could do to get
     enough money from the rascals to pay
     my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
     property was hampered, and often as
     I applied to my lawyers and agents
     for money, would come a reply
     demanding money of me for debts and
     pretended claims which the rapacious
     rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My mother was the only person who,
     in my misfortune, remained faithful
     to me -- indeed, she has always
     spoken of me in my true light, as a
     martyr to the rascality of others,
     and a victim of my own generous and
     confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She was an invaluable person to me
     in my house, which would have been
     at rack and ruin before, but for her
     spirit of order and management and
     her excellent economy in the
     government of my rapidly dwindling
     household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     If anything could have saved me from
     the consequences of villainy in
     others, it would have been the
     admirable prudence of that worthy
     creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     She never went to bed until all the
     house was quiet and all the candles
     out; you may fancy that this was a
     matter of some difficulty with a man
     of my habits who had commonly a
     dozen of jovial fellows to drink
     with me every night, and who
     seldom, for my part, went to bed
     sober.

Actions as per voice over.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Many and many a night, when I was
     unconscious of her attention, has
     that good soul pulled my boots off,
     and seen me laid by my servants snug
     in bed, and carried off the candle
     herself...

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     ... and been the first in the
     morning, too, to bring me my drink
     of small beer.  It was my mother's
     pride that I could drink more than
     any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My mother discovered that always,
     before my lady-wife chose to write
     letters to her milliner, she had
     need of lemons to make her drink, as
     she said, and this fact, being
     mentioned to me, kind of set me
     a-thinking.

               RODERICK
             (reading letter
              aloud)
     "This day, three years ago, my last
     hope and pleasure in life was taken
     from me, and my dear child was
     called to Heaven.  Where is his
     neglected brother, whom I suffered
     to grow up unheeded by my side, and
     whom the tyranny of the monster to
     whom I am united drove to exile,
     and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
     child is still alive and safe.
     Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
     of a wretched mother, who
     acknowledges her crime, her coldness
     towards you, and now bitterly pays
     for her error!  What sufferings,
     what humiliations have I had to
     endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
     halls.  I should fear poison, but
     then I know the wretch has a sordid
     interest in keeping me alive, and
     that my death would be the signal
     for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
     without my odious, hideous, vulgar
     gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
     purses my every step.  I am locked
     into my chamber at night, like a
     felon, and only suffered to leave it
     when ordered into the presence of my
     lord, to be present at his orgies
     with his boon-companions, and to
     hear his odious converse as he
     lapses into the disgusting madness
     of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     It was not possible to recover the
     name for whom the note was intended,
     but it was clear that, to add to all
     my perplexities, three years after
     my poor child's death, my wife,
     whose vagaries of temper and wayward
     follies I had borne with for twelve
     years, wanted to leave me.  I
     decided it best not to reveal to her
     ladyship our discovery, that we
     might still intercept and uncover
     further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     Yet I was bound to be on my guard
     that she should not give me the
     slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
     the next day.  I set my mother to
     keep sharp watch over the moods of
     her ladyship, and you may be sure
     that her assistance and surveillance
     were invaluable to me.  If I had
     paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
     I should not have been half so well
     served as by the disinterested care
     and watchfulness of my excellent
     mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
     me was a singular one.  Her life was
     passed in a series of crack-brained
     sort of alternation between love and
     hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
     a fortnight, then we should be
     friends for a month together
     sometimes.  One day, I was joking
     her, and asking her whether she
     would take the water again, whether
     she had found another lover, and so
     forth.  She suddenly burst out into
     tears, and, after a while, said to
     me:

               COUNTESS
     Roderick, you know well enough that
     I have never loved but you!  Was I
     ever so wretched that a kind word
     from you did not make me happy?
     Ever so angry, but the least offer
     of good-will on your part did not
     bring me to your side?  Did I not
     give a sufficient proof of my
     affection for you in bestowing one
     of the finest fortunes of England
     upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
     you for the way you have wasted it?
     No, I loved you too much and too
     fondly; I have always loved you.
     From the first moment I saw you, I
     saw your bad qualities, and trembled
     at your violence; but I could not
     help loving you.  I married you,
     though I knew I was sealing my own
     fate in doing so, and in spite of
     reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
     you want from me?  I am ready to
     make any, so you will but love me,
     or, if not, that at least, you will
     gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was in a particularly good humor
     that day, and we had a sort of
     reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

               MOTHER
     Depend on it, artful hussy has some
     other scheme in her head now.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     The old lady was right, and I
     swallowed the bait which her
     ladyship had prepared to entrap me
     as simply as any gudgeon takes a
     hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I had hired a money-broker
     especially to find some means of my
     making a loan.  After several months
     without success, it was with some
     considerable interest that I
     received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

               NEWCOMBE
     I have good news for you, Mr.
     Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
     and Chatwick, in the city of London,
     are prepared to lend you 20,000
     pounds, pledged against your
     interest in the Edric mines.  They
     will redeem the encumbrances against
     the property, which amount to some
     10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
     year working lease on the mines.
     They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
     against the lease income,
     which they will apply to the loan as
     it comes in, and they will make a
     charge of 18% per annum interest on
     the outstanding loan balance.

               RODERICK
     Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
     difficult loans during the past few
     years, at very onerous terms, but
     18% a year interest seems very stiff
     indeed.

               NEWCOMBE
     Considering your financial
     circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
     been impossible to find anyone at
     all prepared to do any business with
     you.  I think you may count yourself
     lucky to have this opportunity.
     But, obviously, if you would reject
     this offer, I shall keep trying to
     find a better one.

               RODERICK
             (after a pause)
     I am prepared to accept the terms,
     Mr. Newcombe.

               NEWCOMBE
     There are a few other points we
     should discuss.  The loan agreement
     can only be executed by her
     ladyship's signature, and provided
     that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
     assured of her ladyship's freewill
     in giving her signature.

               RODERICK
     Provided that they can be assured of
     her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
     serious?

               NEWCOMBE
     May I be quite frank with you?

               RODERICK
     Yes, of course.

               NEWCOMBE
     Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
     he had heard her ladyship lives in
     some fear of her life, and meditated
     a separation, in which case, she
     might later repudiate any documents
     signed by herself while in durance,
     and subject them, at any rate, to a
     doubtful and expensive litigation.
     They were quite insistent on this
     point, and said they must have
     absolute assurance of her ladyship's
     perfect freewill in the transaction
     before they would advance a shilling
     of their capital.

               RODERICK
     I see.

               NEWCOMBE
     When I asked them in what form they
     would accept her ladyship's
     assurances, they said that they were
     only prepared to accept them if her
     ladyship confirms her written
     consent by word of mouth, in their
     presence, at their counting-house in
     Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
     they come here, and save her
     ladyship and yourself the
     inconvenience of the trip to London,
     but they declined, saying that they
     did not wish to incur the risk of a
     visit to Castle Hackton to
     negotiate, as they were aware of how
     other respectable parties, such as
     Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
     treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

               MOTHER
     Depend on it, there is some
     artifice.  When once you get into
     that wicked town, you are not safe.
     There are scores of writs out
     against you for debt.  If you are
     taken in London, and thrown into
     prison, your case is hopeless.

               RODERICK
     Mother dear, we are now living off
     our own beef and mutton.  We have to
     watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
     bailiffs without.  There are certain
     situations in which people cannot
     dictate their own terms; and faith,
     we are so pressed now for money,
     that I would sign a bond with old
     Nick himself, if he would provide a
     good round sum.  With this money, we
     can settle our principal debts and
     make a fresh start.

               MOTHER
     Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
     soon as they have you in London,
     they will get the better of my poor
     innocent lad; and the first thing
     that I shall hear of you will be
     that you are in trouble.  You will
     be a victim of your own generous and
     confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

               COUNTESS
     Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
     as long as you are kind to me, as
     you now are.  We can't appear in
     London as we ought; the little money
     you will get will be spent, like all
     the rest has been.  Let us stay here
     and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

               MOTHER
     Humph!  I believe she is at the
     bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We did not start in state, you may
     be sure.  We did not let the country
     know we were going, or leave notice
     of adieu with our neighbors.  The
     famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
     noble wife traveled in a hack-
     chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     When a man is going to the devil,
     how easy and pleasant a journey it
     is!  The thought of the money quite
     put me in a good humor, and my wife,
     as she lay on my shoulder in the
     post-chaise, going to London, said
     it was the happiest ride she had
     taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     My lady and I agreed that, with the
     money, we would go to France, and
     wait there for better times, and
     that night, over our supper, formed
     a score of plans both for pleasure
     and retrenchment.  You would have
     thought it was Darby and Joan
     together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
     Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
     blandishments, how happy she seemed
     to be on that night!  What an air of
     innocent confidence appeared in her
     behavior, and what affectionate
     names she called me!  I am lost in
     wonder at the depth of her
     hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
     that an unsuspecting person like
     myself should have been a victim to
     such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     We were in London at three o'clock,
     an half-an-hour before the time
     appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
     apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
     in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

               COUNTESS
     Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
     there is danger.  There's time yet,
     let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

               RODERICK
     Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

               COUNTESS
     Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

               COUNTESS
     Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

               COUNTESS
     Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
     the most crafty and treacherous
     monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
     fool when I married you, and gave up
     other and nobler hearts for your
     sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
     forgot my name and lineage to unite
     myself with a base-born adventurer
     -- a fool to bear, without repining,
     the most monstrous tyranny that ever
     woman suffered; to allow my property
     to be squandered; to see women as
     base and low-born as yourself...

               TAPEWELL
     For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

               RODERICK
     You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
     said "old" fool.

               BROOKSIDE
     I have no doubt that you said and
     did, sir, everything that a
     blackguard could say or do.  This
     lady is now safe under the
     protection of her relations and the
     law, and need fear your infamous
     persecutions no longer.

               RODERICK
     But you are not safe, and as sure as
     I am a man of honor, I will have
     your heart's blood.

               TAPEWELL
     Take down his words, constables;
     swear the peace against him.

               BROOKSIDE
     I would not sully my sword with the
     blood of such a ruffian.  If the
     scoundrel remains in London another
     day, he will be seized as a common
     swindler.

               RODERICK
     Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

               RODERICK
     Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
     cowardly braggart, come first, if
     you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

               TAPEWELL
     We are not going to seize you!  My
     dear sir, we don't wish to seize
     you; we will give you a handsome sum
     to leave the country, only leave her
     ladyship in peace.

               BROOKSIDE
     And the country will be rid of such
     a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was no longer the man I was at
     twenty, when I should have charged
     the ruffians, sword in hand, and
     sent at least one of them to his
     account.  I was broken in spirit,
     regularly caught in the toils,
     utterly baffled and beaten by that
     woman.  Was she relenting at the
     door, when she paused and begged me
     to turn back?  Had she not a
     lingering love for me still?  Her
     conduct showed it, as I came to
     reflect on it.  It was my only
     chance now left in the world, so I
     put down my sword upon the lawyers
     desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

               RODERICK
     Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
     you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
     ready to speak with him when he is
     at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

               RODERICK (V.O.)
     I was instructed to take a lodging
     for the night in a coffee house near
     Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
     visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

               TAPEWELL
     I have been authorized by Lady
     Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
     an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
     specifically on the condition of you
     remaining abroad out of the three
     kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
     instant of your return.  I advise
     you to accept it without delay for
     you know, as well as I do, that your
     stay in London will infallibly
     plunge you in gaol, as there are
     innumerable writs taken out against
     you here and in the west of England,
     and that your credit is so blown
     upon that you could not hope to
     raise a shilling.  I will leave you
     the night to consider this proposal,
     but if you refuse, the family will
     proceed against you in London, and
     have you arrested.  If you accede, a
     quarter salary will be paid to you
     at any foreign port you should
     prefer.

               RODERICK
     Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
     night to consider this proposal.
     What other choice has a poor, lonely
     and broken-hearted man?  I shall
     take the annuity, and leave the
     country.

               MR. TAPEWELL
     I am very glad to hear that you have
     come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
     I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

               NARRATOR
     Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
     narrative finishes here, for the
     hand of death interrupted the
     ingenious author soon after the
     period which this memoir was
     compiled, after he had lived
     nineteen years an inmate of the
     Fleet Prison, where the prison
     records state he died of delirium
     tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

               NARRATOR
     His faithful old mother joined him
     in his lonely exile, and had a
     bedroom in Fleet Market over the
     way.  She would come and stay the
     whole day with him in prison
     working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

               NARRATOR
     The Countess was never out of love
     with her husband, and, as long as
     she lived, James enjoyed his income
     of 300 pounds per year and was,
     perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
     any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

               NARRATOR
     When her ladyship died, her son
     sternly cut off the annuity,
     devoting the sum to charities,
     which, he said, would make a nobler
     use of it than the scoundrel who had
     enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

               NARRATOR
     When the famous character lost his
     income, his spirit entirely failed.
     He was removed into the pauper's
     ward, where he was known to black
     boots for wealthier prisoners, and
     where he was detected in stealing a
     tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

               NARRATOR
     His mother attained a prodigious old
     age, and the inhabitants of the
     place in her time can record, with
     accuracy, the daily disputes which
     used to take place between mother
     and son, until the latter, from
     habits of intoxication, falling into
     a state of almost imbecility, was
     tended by his tough old parent as a
     baby almost, and would cry if
     deprived of his necessary glass of
     brandy.

TITLE CARD

     It was in the reign of George III
     that the above-named personages
     lived and quarreled; good or bad,
     handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they
     are all equal now.

                                  FADE OUT.

               THE END
