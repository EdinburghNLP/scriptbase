    MONTAGE - POV SHOTS OF PARIS SET TO MUSIC
    We hear voices over - GIL and INEZ, a young couple of
    Americans, engaged to be married as we shall learn. (Standard
    locations are listed here but they will be determined later
    when we location scout. Music.

                        GIL (V.O.)
              This is unbelievable - look at
              this. There's no city like this in
              the world. There never was.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              It's become so touristy.
                         GIL (V.O.)
              Well that's just the awful era we
              live in but can you just imagine
              what this was like before - but
              even with all the fast food joints
              and the traffic - god, you just
              can't imagine what it was like
              years ago.
                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Well you like cities.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              I really do - I love cities - I
              love big cities with all the crowds
              and all the action.
    (Having seen a panoramic view of let us say the Champs Elysee
    we embark on a montage of the city. The comments offered
    above and following are an approximation of what the actors
    feel.)

              Look at these places - the streets -
              the boulevards.

              before.

                         GIL (V.O.)
              I don't get here often enough is
              the problem. Every once in a while
              for a few days is nothing - my
              biggest regret is that I didn't
              settle here the first time I came.
              I should have gone with my
              instincts.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              I admit it's pretty but so are so
              many other places I've visited.
                        GIL
              If I'd have stayed the first time I
              came by now I'd be a Parisian.
                          INEZ (V.O.)
              Starving.

    (Pause here for third dialogue exchange)
                         GIL (V.O.)
              I'm thinking of a painting by
              Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the
              rain. Can you picture how drop
              dead gorgeous this city is in the
              rain? Imagine this town in the
              twenties - Paris in the twenties -
              in the rain - the artists and
              writers - I was born too late. Why
              did God deliver me into the world
              in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Why does every city have to be in
              the rain? What's wonderful about
              getting wet?
                        GIL (V.O.)
              It's romantic.
                          INEZ (V.O.)
              It's annoying.

                        GIL (V.O.)
              Or Paris when it's just getting
              dark - the lights go on - or at
              night - it's great at night - or
              no, sunset on the Champs Elysees -
                        GIL (V.O.)
              Could you ever think of us moving
              here after we're married?

                         INEZ (V.O.)
              Oh god, no. I could never live out
              of the United States. And if I
              could it would be someplace totally
              different.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              Like?
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              I don't know, Hawaii.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              Hawaii is America.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Yes but it's - Hawaiian.
                        GIL (V.O.)
              If I had stayed here and written
              novels and not gotten into grinding
              out movie scripts.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              Right, and becoming rich and
              successful. Tell me the sad story.
                         GIL (V.O.)
              But this is where all the artists
              came to live, to work - the
              writers, the painters.
                        INEZ (V.O.)
              That was ninety years ago.
                                                                 4

              Boy, I'd drop the house in Beverly
              Hills, the pool, everything - in a
              heartbeat. Look - this is where
              Monet lived and painted - we're
              thirty minutes from town. Imagine
              the two of us settling here. If my
              book turns out we could do it - you
              could just as easily make jewelry
              here.

              I could easily see myself as a

              a baguette under my arm - finishing
              my novel - at a table at the Cafe

              Hemingway called it.

              There's nothing wrong with your
              father and I disagreeing. That's
              what democracy is. Your father
              defends the right wing of the
              Republican party and I happen to
              think they represent sub-mental
              Neanderthals. But we respect each
              other's views - am I right?

              Can we discuss the wedding plans?
              Your father's used his good offices
              with the opera to get some of the
              singers to attend and sing. I
              thought Puccini would be nice.

              bipartisan in that, in my view, to
              be a politician of any party one

                 We were going to have lunch at the

              Well they're your friends and I

              He's brilliant. I used to have
              such a crush on him at college. And
              Carol's very bright.
                        GIL
              I find him a pseudo-intellectual.
                         INEZ
              I hardly think the Sorbo nne would
              have him lecturing if he's a pseudo-
              intellectual. You should give him
              your novel to read. I'm sure he'd
              be able to critique your writing
              and show you why you're having so
              much trouble.

              I'm having trouble because I'm a

               I believe Louis moved his court
               here in about 1682 - originally
               this was all swamp land - in fact,
               if I'm not mistaken, in old French
               the word Versailles means something
               like "terrain where the weeds have
               been pulled". The main structure
               is French classical style at its
               height - the work, I believe of
               Louis Le Vau, I think Mansart and

               You should talk, John - especially
               for someone who once advocated the
               boycott of french wines.
                         JOHN
               I'll always take a California wine
               but the Napa Valley is six thousand
               miles away.

               To me they're all great.   What the
               hell do I know?

               I don't think I've ever seen your

               Pheromones, it's your pheromones.
     Paul and Carol have ambled over, having heard Gil's last
     amorous remark.
                         PAUL
               Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels
               the desire but kills the
               performance - according to the
               Bard.
                          CAROL
               Have you tasted the '61? It's
               divine - though Paul found it -
               what?
                         PAUL
               Slightly more tannic than the '59.
               I prefer a smoky feeling to a
               fruity feeling, don't you agree?
                         GIL
               You will admit she's a sexy woman.
                         PAUL
               This I have known for many years.
               You're a very lucky man.

                  Carol and I are going to go dancing
                  - we heard of a great place.
                  Interested?
                            INEZ
                  Sure.

                  I don't want to be a party pooper
                  but I just want fresh air.
                            INEZ
                  Oh come on - although if you're
                  just going to sit there and obsess
                  over where the fire exits are.
                            CAROL
                  If Gil doesn't want to go, I'll
                  share Paul with you. I'm very
                  democratic. And he's a marvelous
                  dancer.
                            GIL
                  If it's okay with you, I'd really
                  just like a little walk and go to
                  bed. We can do it another night.

               Back home we just joined a
               marvelous tennis club and Paul says
               you play. Does Gil?

               I can't introduce him to tennis -
               Daddy's having the damndest time
               pressuring him to learn golf.
                          PAUL
               Is he a good writer?     Have you read
               his prose?
                          INEZ
               He won't let anybody -
                          PAUL
               If he wants I'd be glad to go over
               his novel and critique it for him.
                          INEZ
               That's what he needs, to have it
               read by someone who really knows
               and wouldn't pull any punches. The
               problem is - when it comes to his
               writing he has no respect for
               anyone's opinion.

     Gil wanders. Eventually he is at a lovely spot. Perhaps by
     the river, the bridge - or somewhere else but he's just
     wandering lost. Finally he looks at his watch.
     Either by his watch or a nearby building clock, the hands
     move to exactly midnight. perhaps midnight chimes somewhere.
     At precisely that moment a car happens to pull up along side
     him. Inside are TWO MEN and TWO WOMAN - elegant - they have
     champagne and glasses and they pour from the open bottle and
     drink happily.

               Calm yourself - get a grip, Gil -
               deep breaths - been quite a night -
               Fitzgerald - Hemingway - the
               Hemingway - Papa - where do I meet
               him - he never said.
     Gil goes to return to the cafe - he can't find the door, nor
     the club facade. It's gone.
     We are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade
     where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he can't
     find it.

               Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is
               exactly as we've come to know her
               from articles and books - she's
               mercurial and moody and she does
               not get along with Hemingway - and
               Scott knows Hemingway's right about
               it but you can see how conflicted
               he is because he loves her -
                         INEZ
               Right, right - er where's my cold
               cream - we should knock off the
               idle chatter because we're going to
               be late.
                          GIL
               Actually I wanted to stay and work
               on my novel - it needs a little
               polishing.
                         INEZ
               You can work on it later. And we

                   I believe that love that's true and
                   real creates a respite from death.
                   All cowardice comes from not loving
                   or not loving well which is the
                   same thing and when the man who is
                   brave and true looks death squarely
                   in the face like some rhino hunters
                   I know or Belmonte who is truly
                   brave, it is because they love with
                   sufficient passion to push death
                   out of their minds till it returns
                   as it does to all men and then you
                   must make really good love again.

              I was just telling Pablo that this
              portrait doesn't capture Adriana.
              It has universality but no
              objectivity.
                        PABLO
              Vous ne le comprenez pas
              correctment. Vous ne connaissez
              pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui
              la represente.
                         STEIN
              No tu n'a pas raison. Look how
              he's done her - dripping with
              sexual innuendo. Carnal to the
              point of smoldering and yes she's
              beautiful but it's a subtle beauty -
              an implied sensuality.
                   (to Gil)
              What is your first impression of
              Adriana?

                   (very taken)
              ····· Exceptionally lovely.

              You're right Gertrude - of course
              you can see why he's lost his
              objectivity.

                         STEIN
              You've made a creation of Place
              Pigalle, a whore with volcanic
              appetites.
                        PABLO
              Mais c'est comme elle est, si vous
              la connaissez.
                        STEIN
              Yes - avec vous en prive - because
              she's your lover - but we don't
              know her that way - so you make a
              petit bourgeoise judgment and turn
              her into an object of pleasure.

     She collars Hemingway and they huddle to one side. Picasso
     has busied himself at a distant spot with a drink, sulking.
     This leaves Gil off with Adriana to chat.

                  haunted, Jewish-Italian painter -
                  and I knew Amedeo had another woman

                  into his apartment when he asked

                  was another woman - many - and now
                  with Pablo - I mean Pablo is
                  married but every day it's on
                  again, off again - I don't know how
                  any woman can stay with him - he's
                  so difficult.

                   The juxtaposition of color is
                   amazing. This man was the real
                   father of abstract expressionism.
                   I take that back, maybe Turner.
                             INEZ
                   I prefer Monet. I mean I love
                   Turner but this is overwhelming.
                             PAUL
                   If I'm not mistaken it took him two
                   years to complete this. And he

                   I find Monet almost too pretty -
                   like Renoir - sometimes it's
                   cloying.

                If I'm not mistaken he painted this

                mistress Madeline Brissou in the
                twenties.
                          GIL
                Er - I have to differ with you on
                this one.

                something.
                           GIL
                If I'm not mistaken this was a
                failed attempt to capture a young
                French girl named Adriana - from
                Bordeaux - if my art history serves
                me - came to Paris to study costume
                design for the theatre. Believe
                she had a brief affair with
                Modigliani - then Braque - that's
                where Pablo met her - er Picasso.
                You'd never know it from this
                portrait but she's quite subtly
                beautiful.
                          INEZ
                What have you been smoking?
                          GIL
                And I'd hardly call the picture
                superb. It's more of a petit
                bourgeoise statement of how Pablo
                er Picasso sees her, saw her - he's
                distracted by the fact she was a
                volcano in the sack.

                  Republicans. They're decent people

                  they're not crypto-fascist, airhead

               Vous avez l'ame d'un poete.
                         GIL
               You're very kind. I would not call
               my babbling poetic.

     Gil and Adriana are here with the street lined with
     prostitutes.
                         ADRIANA
               See anything you like?
                          GIL
               I'm ashamed to admit I'm attracted
               to all of them. I like cheap-sexy.
               I know it's shallow.
                         ADRIANA
               When I was in Catholic school, one
               weekend, my roommate and I paid one
               of the girls of Pigalle to come
               teach us all her tricks.
                         GIL
               Well, that's the most interesting
               thing I've ever heard in my life -
               I'd like to think about that for
               awhile.

                         ADRIANA
               I love that the main character in
               your book sells memories.
                         GIL
               Because he believes in his soul
               that progress is not automatically
               for the better.
                         ADRIANA
               Often quite the opposite.
                         GIL
               Say - is that who I think it is?
                         ADRIANA
               What is she doing here? And why is
               she staring into the river.
     They see a distraught woman contemplating jumping into the
     river. Upon running to her, it's Zelda.
                          ADRIANA
               Oh gosh!   My god - what are you
               doing?
                          ZELDA
               Please leave me alone.   I don't
               want to live.

               It all became clear to me tonight.
               Scott and that beautiful Countess -
               it was so obvious they were
               whispering about me and the more
               they drank the more he fell in love
               with her.
                         GIL
               Scott loves only you. I can tell
               you with absolute certainty.
                          ZELDA
               No, he's tired of me.

              No you're wrong. I know.
                            ZELDA
              How?   How?

              Trust me.      I know.
                        ZELDA
              But you just met us. How can you
              know anything. My skin hurts. I
              hate the way I look.

              Take this.

                        ZELDA
              What is this?
                        GIL
              A Valium - it'll calm you down.
                        ADRIANA
              You carry medicine?
                         GIL
              Only since Inez and I became
              engaged. I've had these anxiety
              attacks - I'm sure after the
              wedding they'll subside.
                        ZELDA
              I never heard of Valium.   What is
              this?
                        GIL
              Er - it's the pill of the future.
                        ZELDA
              But pills wear off - and then it
              all comes back. No, I won't kill
              myself. I'll write and I'll write
              more passionately than Scott. I'll
              work harder.
                        ADRIANA
              He loves you. He's not with that
              woman. She's already on her way
              back to Rome.

                  I'll try and score some more for

                  Come on, we'll find a taxi. We'll

                  Yes - I - I mean it's in the

                  Well good luck with your book and

                            GIL
                  You'd like Inez - she has a sharp
                  sense of humor - and she's sexy -
                  not that we agree on everything.

                  But the important things.
                             GIL
                  Actually the small things - the
                  important things we don't - she'd
                  like to live in Malibu and that I'd
                  work in Hollywood - but I will say
                  we both like - er - er Indian food -
                  not all Indian food - pita bread -

               countryside. He's taking us for
               lunch at this beautiful little inn.
               I know you like making love in the
               morning but I find it much sexier
               late afternoon - just before we go
               out to dinner. Except I always
               have to explain to my parents why
               your cheeks look radiant. Hey-
               I'm not going to force you. I know

              Hello - Bonjour - I'd like to ask
              you a question about Rodin.
                        GUIDE
              Yes?
                        GIL
              He loved his wife, he also loved
              his mistress - is it really
              possible to be in love with two
              women?
                        GUIDE
              He loved both in different ways.

              God it's so French. Er - you
              remember me?
                        GUIDE
              I do. Qui - you were with the
              group, the pedantic gentleman.
                        GIL
              Yeah, pedantic - perfect word.
              You're very observant. I need some
              advice. I'd like a woman's take. A
              French woman - an observant French
              woman. I met some woman that I
              very quickly became smitten with.
              Smitten?

              I'm engaged to be married. I know
              Rodin had a wife and a mistress but
              I'm American - we can't handle that
              - we're monogamous.
                        GUIDE

                  See, another very gifted man flirts
                  with her, a writer. All these
                  geniuses fall in love with her.
                  And what am I? And then of course
                  there's another big problem. I
                  can't exactly explain.
                            GUIDE
                  Yes?

                  I don't know whether to call it an
                  age difference - or a problem of
                  geography - I'm so messed up. I'm

               the futuristic devices - television
               sets, supersonic flight - and yet
               it's not typical science fiction -

               Nevertheless you have to get rid of
               all that technology - what's good
               about your book are the characters -
               the human questions - love -
               mortality - nobody cares about the
               technology, they care about the
               human heart. We all fear death and
               question our place in the universe.
               Unfortunately your book lapses into
               easy pessimism. I was having this
               conversation with Giacometti the
               other day - he's such a gloom
               monger.

                          STEIN
               It's the artist's job not to
               succumb to despair but to find an
               antidote to the emptiness of
               existence. I find your voice clear
               and lively - don't be such a

     pretty than great - the kind people buy for the binding or
     plates.
     He picks up a pretty bound but totally wrecked book in the
     inside. It is slim, leather, torn up.
     He reads the title page in hand writing.     It reads:     "This
     diary belongs to Adriana Dupree."

               That immediate magic one hears
               about happened to me. I know that
               both Picasso and Hemingway are in
               love with me but for whatever
               inexplicable reasons the heart has,
               I am drawn to Gil. Perhaps because
               he seems naive and unassuming.

               As always in this sad life he is
               about to marry a woman named Inez.
               I had a dream where he came to me
               and brought me a little gift -
               earrings they were - and we made
               love. perhaps it is just as well I
               accept Hemingway's offer to go to
               Africa. Life with Pablo is too
               full of conflict and I am
               suffocating under his genius. Why
               I need to go from one brilliant man
               to another is my weakness. Gil is
               different, perhaps not a genius but
               not moody and selfish like Pablo or
               Amedeo was. I think a trip to
               Africa with Hemingway would help
               get these feelings for Gil off my
               mind.

                  Maybe you thought you put them away
                  and left them out or dropped them,
                  and the maid found them and left
                  them out where you could see them
                  easily.

               We shouldn't bother him.

                  like that today - not Pablo, not
                  Matisse -

                  I think we should stay here - it's
                  the start of the Belle Epoque -
                  this is the greatest, most
                  beautiful era Paris has ever known.

                  But I love the Jazz Age.
                            ADRIANA
                  The twenties are full of strife and
                  uncertainty. But think of it, Gil -
                  the two of us - in a lovely art
                  nouveau home - I'll work in the
                  fashion world - I love the styles -
                  you can write ··· it's the age of
                  Debussy and Guimard. Maybe you can
                  meet Balzac.

                    dropped in on the 1890's.
                               ADRIANA

                              ADRIANA
                    Surely you don't think the twenties
                    are a golden age?

                    But I'm from the twenties and I'm
                    tellin~ you the golden age is the
                    Belle Epoque.
                              GIL
                    Yes but don't you see - to these
                    guys the golden age was the
                    Renaissance. They'd all trade the
                    Belle Epoque to paint alongside
                    Michelangelo or Titian. And those
                    guys probably imagine life was
                    better when Kubla Khan was around.
                    I'm having an insight. A minor one
                    but that accounts for the anxiety
                    of my dream.

                              GIL
                    And even in the twenties - no
                    dishwashers - no 911 if your
                    appendix bursts - no "movies on
                    demand" ·
                              ADRIANA
                    But if we love each other what does
                    it matter when we live?
                               GIL
                    Because if you stay here and this
                    becomes your present, sooner or
                    later you'll imagine another time
                    was really the golden time. And so
                    will I - I'm beginning to see why
                    it can't work, Adriana. The
                    present has a hold on you because
                    it's your present and while there's
                    never any progress in the most
                    important things, you get to
                    appreciate - what little progress
                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,
                    searching - it's my job as a writer
                    to try and come up with reasons why
                    despite life being tragic and
                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
                               ADRIANA
                    That's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but
                    I'm more emotional. I'm going to
                    stay and live in Paris' most
                    glorious time. You made a choice
                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.
                              GIL
                    Yes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice
                    between accepting reality or
                    surreal insanity.
                                                                      83

                            ADRIANA
                  So finally you do love Inez more
                  than me.
                            GIL
                  No - I love you - but this way lies
                  madness - and if I'm ever going to
                  write anything worthwhile I've got
                  to get rid of my illusions and that
                  I'd be happier in the past is one
                  of them.

                  Ah - Pender - I read your rewrite.
                  Yes ··· you're nicely on the right
                  track. You've understood me
                  clearly. If the rest of the book
                  reads as well when you're done
                  you'll have something of value.

                  Thank you. I can't tell you how

               From Ernest Hemingway. He thought
               it out and it makes perfect sense.
                         INEZ
               Gil, your brain tumor's acting up
               again.
                         GIL
               There's nothing crazy about Ernest
               Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or
               Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -

               Nothing except they've all been
               dead for years.

               It was William Faulkner who said,

              Actually I ran into Bill Faulkner
              at a party.

              Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a
              madman - okay - Paul and I had a
              few nights alone. We danced, we
              drank - you were always working -
              he's very attractive, he spoke to
              me in French - the whole mystique
              of this corny city got to me - it's
              over. We can put this all in
              perspective at home.

              I'm staying here. It's not the
