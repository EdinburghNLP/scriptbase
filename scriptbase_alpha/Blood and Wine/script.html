<b>                             BLOOD AND WINE
</b>


                              Written by

                            Nick Villiers





<b>                                                   SECOND DRAFT
</b>
<b>                                              DECEMBER 12, 1994
</b>


<b>          FADE IN:
</b>

<b>          A PAIR OF HANDS
</b>          men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry
          towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the
          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.
          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO
          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no
          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half
          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
          floor.

<b>          ALL IN CLOSEUP
</b>          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a
          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket
          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a
          hook and walks from

<b>                         THE CELLAR
</b>          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-
          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying
          the open bottle by the neck.

<b>          2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT
</b>
          Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar
          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.
          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle
          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits
          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He
          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the
          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the
          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.
          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,
          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's
          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see
          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.
          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Twenty people tonight. I got a
          South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon --
          they actually came together.

<b>                         (A BEAT)
</b>          These people -- all they really want
          is something to brag about at dinner
          parties.
          He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours
          behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the
          plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>           2.

<b>                          2
</b>
<b>                         2 CONTINUED:
</b>          There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks
          off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
          the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting
          room.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          There I was, passing the wine,
          passing the bread, I suddenly felt
          like the priest at Masst Or maybe
          Mass started out as a wine tasting,
          and Jesus was a salesman. what do
          you think?
          He goes into

<b>          THE TASTING ROOM
</b>          It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding
          chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of
          the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
          BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed
          underneath. The woman's voice that replies is
          Gabriella's.

<b>          GABRIELLA (0.S.)
</b>          (with a throaty laugh)
          Maybe I should get dressed.
          Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
          panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking
          South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping
          red wine from a plastic glass.

<b>                         GABRIETM
</b>          I don't want to spoil a religious
          experience.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf?
          He throws away some of the glasses.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Duboeuf has a nose and a palate --
          like a gift from God. He can taste
          a single grape before the harvest...
          and describe the beaujolais it's
          going to produce.
          She laughs.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          Oh, you have competition.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>

<b>                         (SLIGHTLY ANNOYED)
</b>          You know how many bottles I have in
          this store? Open any one of 'em,
          I'll tell you the vintage and
          vintner, b
          lindfolded.
          He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on
          the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties.
          She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band.
          She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          Okay. Show me.

          She passes her glass under his nose.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Gabriella, I picked these wines.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          So what is it?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          All I can smell is your perfume.
          She laughs.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          I'm not wearing any.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          I even bought it for you.
          She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers
          her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          Tell me now.
          He kisses her wet breast.

          He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth
          softly, then fully.

          Alex is unlocking the door for Gabriella. Dressed, she
          looks younger. They're awkward with each other.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          Don't think you have to say it
          because .1 say it, Alex.

          Alex lets out a breath.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Oh, yeah... We're pretty good.
          He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to
          her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off
          before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting
          room.

          Alex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air
          from the open bottles. He hears a quiet CLANK of METAL.
          Instantly alert, he reaches for his jacket and turns off
          the-light.

          Behind the cash register Alex opens a drawer and takes out
          a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR,
          like someone trying to break in through the back door from

          locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
          whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security

          Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
          he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
          higher wattage than the security lights.

          sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been
          a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up
          the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses
          the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne
          smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to
          see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in
          a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the
          bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing
          with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.

          Suzanne and Jason cross the parking lot toward the coffee

          it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans
          forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with
          a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.

          loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a
          square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the
          studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his
          tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically

          She carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail
          and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack.
          Her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope; she moves
          it out from the pile. It has been forwarded several
          times. And it's addressed to her.

          Victor lays his cheek along the living room wall to

          off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He
          touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade

          Gabriella and Jason tenderly make love in the swaying
          cabin.

          On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY
          dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS
          BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off
          the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice
          Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click
          off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the
          slips.

<b>          214 INT. BOAT - DAY 214
</b>
          Jason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He
          slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's
          arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin
          hatch.

<b>                         HIS POV
</b>          Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as
          Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his
          lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a
          donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Good morning! I brought donuts.
          Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the
          boat, his arms around his ribs.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Oh, it's not as bad as all that.

<b>                         JASON

          Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex
          quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.

          He makes himself comfortable.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Then make yourself useful and cast
          off the stern line.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          There's not a lot of choice.
          Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He
          sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies
          store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          -- If we could manage to ignore the
          personal history here, I think we

          Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          You want Gabriella? This is the way

          .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for
          another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL
          hitting the waves substitute for conversation.

          He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,

          And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line

          Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in
          a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.
          He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to
          the surface a big, dark green fish. _

<b>                         ALEX

<b>                         JASON

          Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and
          thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.

          His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
          reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his
          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast
          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He
          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it
          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving
          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared
          without either of them noticing.

          from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled,
          warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws
          snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He
          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark
          continues to tear at him.

          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.

<b>                         ALEX

          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
          slightly.

          Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
          left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She

          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses

          Come on back!

          Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
          give up hope in a hopeless situation.
