                                              DECEMBER 12, 1994



          FADE IN:


          A PAIR OF HANDS
          men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry
          towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the
          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.
          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO
          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no
          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half
          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
          floor.

          ALL IN CLOSEUP
          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a
          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket
          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a
          hook and walks from

                         THE CELLAR
          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-
          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying
          the open bottle by the neck.

          2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT

          Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar
          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.
          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle
          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits
          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He
          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the
          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the
          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.
          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,
          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's
          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see
          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.
          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.

                         ALEX
          Twenty people tonight. I got a
          South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon --
          they actually came together.

                         (A BEAT)
          These people -- all they really want
          is something to brag about at dinner
          parties.
          He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours
          behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the
          plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away.

                         (CONTINUED)

          There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks
          off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
          the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting
          room.

                         ALEX
          There I was, passing the wine,
          passing the bread, I suddenly felt
          like the priest at Masst Or maybe
          Mass started out as a wine tasting,
          and Jesus was a salesman. what do
          you think?
          He goes into

          THE TASTING ROOM
          It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding
          chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of
          the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
          BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed
          underneath. The woman's voice that replies is
          Gabriella's.

          GABRIELLA (0.S.)
          (with a throaty laugh)
          Maybe I should get dressed.
          Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
          panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking
          South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping
          red wine from a plastic glass.

                         GABRIETM
          I don't want to spoil a religious
          experience.

                         ALEX
          -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf?
          He throws away some of the glasses.

                         ALEX
          Duboeuf has a nose and a palate --
          like a gift from God. He can taste
          a single grape before the harvest...
          and describe the beaujolais it's
          going to produce.
          She laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh, you have competition.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         (SLIGHTLY ANNOYED)
          You know how many bottles I have in
          this store? Open any one of 'em,
          I'll tell you the vintage and
          vintner, b

          He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on
          the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties.
          She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band.
          She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          Okay. Show me.

                         ALEX
          Victoria's Secret 95.
          She passes her glass under his nose.

                         ALEX
          Gabriella, I picked these wines.

                         GABRIELLA
          So what is it?

                         ALEX
          All I can smell is your perfume.
          She laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm not wearing any.

                         ALEX
          I even bought it for you.
          She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers
          her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.

                         GABRIELLA
          Tell me now.
          He kisses her wet breast.

                         ALEX

                         (WITHOUT HESITATION)
          Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very
          aggressive.
          He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth
          softly, then fully.

          3 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

          Alex is unlocking the door for Gabriella. Dressed, she
          looks younger. They're awkward with each other.

                         GABRIELLA
          Don't think you have to say it
          because .1 say it, Alex.

                         (SMILING BRIGHTLY)
          Doesn't mean anything..

                         ALEX
          It means something to me.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (EASED)
          We're good together, aren't we.
          Alex lets out a breath.

                         ALEX
          Oh, yeah... We're pretty good.
          He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to
          her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off
          before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting
          room.

          4 INT. TASTING ROOM - NIGHT

          Alex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air
          from the open bottles. He hears a quiet CLANK of METAL.
          Instantly alert, he reaches for his jacket and turns off
          the-light.

                         5

          5 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT

          Behind the cash register Alex opens a drawer and takes out
          a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR,
          like someone trying to break in through the back door from
          the parking lot. Alex slings his jacket casually over the
          gun.

          6 EXT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT

          Alex throws open the back door; he's counting on the
          element of surprise.

                         HIS POV
          His red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain
          locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
          whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security
          lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain.

                         ALEX

                         (ADVANCING)
          You think you're gonna steal my car,
          asshole?
          The younger man whirls around.

                         YOUNG MAN
          You scared me, man.
          A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from
          behind the wheel.

                         REPO MAN
          This is not your car, sir. This car
          belongs to the Star Leasing Company.
          Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
          he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
          higher wattage than the security lights.

                         REPO MAN
          I can collect either the money or
          the car. Given how much you owe, I
          figure it's the car.
          The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.

                         ALEX
          Pop the. trunk.

                         REPO MAN
          We inventory the property at the
          yard.
          He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as
          soon as the exit is clear.

                         ALEX
          I just want to show you something.
          Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's
          charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the
          still-running car.

          In his hand he has the locking "Club" Alex usually uses to
          secure his. steering wheel. He's not stupid. Amused, Alex
          takes a step back, palms up.

                         YOUNG MAN
          What are you doing?
          The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.

                         ALEX
          Do you drink?

                         REPO MAN
          Not on the job. What is this,
          booze?

                         ALEX
          Two cases of single malt whiskey
          aged in the barrel before he was
          born.

                         REPO MAN
          The Caddy's overdue.

                         ALEX
          So are you. Drink it with the kid.
          Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy
          yourselves. Isn't that worth a few
          days' breather...

                         (A BEAT)
          My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I,
          maybe, for not firing him.
          The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.

                         YOUNG MAN
          We're clear.

          Alex is driving fast, top down, Samba MUSIC loud on the
          STEREO. He keeps time on the wheel as the Miami skyline
          cruises by.

          EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Alex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium
          building before the gate has slid all the way open. The

          topple; he grabs it before it goes over.

          JASON, a handsome, troubled 17-year-old with long, dark
          hair, is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the
          center island. He looks harder and wiser than his years.
          Tackle is strewn everywhere. Some spaghetti remains in
          the pot it was cooked in and Jason's knife is standing
          upright in it. Alex walks into the kitchen. He makes an
          effort to be pleasant, although he's irritated by the
          mess, by the motorcycle.

                         ALEX
          It's late, Jason.

                          LANDING UPSTAIRS

           SUZANNE (O .S=.. )
          Now what are you arguing about?

                         SUZANNE
          is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense
          of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not
          stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in
          front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular,
          like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.

                         JASON
          It's not an argument.

                         ALEX
          I asked him to clean up downstairs.

                         SUZANNE

                         (SOOTHING ALEX)
          Maybe he hadn't finished-

                         ALEX
          A modicum of cooperation, you know?

                         JASON
          A modicum. What's that. Modicum my
          ass.
          He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne
          follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind.

                         SUZANNE
          I don't like that tone from: you.

                         JASON
          Then go to bed.

                         ALEX
          Hey!

          What!

                         SUZANNE
          It's too late for this.

                         ALEX
          Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door.

          12 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Alex stands under water as hot as he can stand, parboiling
          himself. Eyes squeezed shut, he lets out a long breath.
          His life demands more energy than he has anymore. He
          soaps himself thoroughly.

                         13

          13 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Suzanne hears the front DOOR SLAM. Jason's DUCATI STARTS
          UP and ACCELERATES away. Alex comes out of the bathroom
          in a towel.

                         SUZANNE

                         (FONDLY)
          Lie down, I'll give you a back rub.
          She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post
          for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh.

                         SUZANNE
          -- maybe I'd better lie down.
          He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television.
          Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a
          cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her
          best.

                         SUZANNE
          I liked the twin nurses. There was
          kind of a story.
          Alex brings the remote control back to bed.

          He hangs his towel on a doorknob, slides into bed, starts
          the tape, which begins with sweat-slick dancing girls at
          Carnival. To Suzanne's astonishment, it turns out to be
          a travelog.

                         SUZANNE
          Rio?

                         ALEX
          I've been so busy. We could sneak
          away for a week.. Would you like
          that?

                         SUZANNE
          If we really go. Last time I
          packed, we went nowhere.

                         ALEX

                         (SLEEPILY)
          Last time was different.

                         SUZANNE
          (watching the tape)
          The beaches -- I thought we had a
          beach. I read how the hotels keep
          spotters on the roof with scopes, to
          keep thieves away from the guests.
          They can look at every inch of your
          body through the scope.
          (with a low laugh)
          Do you mind that I like that? Alex?
          He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his
          shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.

          14 EXT. BOAT - DAWN 14

          On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases
          the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The
          SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat
          dips and dances to the music of the water.
          Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to
          troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten
          around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at
          the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word.

                         JASON

          Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of
          the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately
          fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel
          for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps
          behind the rod. The fish hits.

                         JASON
          Time to go to work, man! C'mon.
           A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning,
          scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's
           weathered his head for some time.

                         HENRY
          Who we got?

                         JASON
          Let's find out.
          He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean,
          they both recognize the fish at the end.

                         HENRY
          Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out
          of the good stuff. Damn.
          He spits over the side. Jason grins.

                         JASON
          This one's got more to worry about
          than you do.
          He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-

                         HENRY
          Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I
          want to know the sucker's good and
          dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat.

          Jason and Henry slap their catch onto the Fishmonger's
          slippery counter. The market's noisy, men shouting. We
          see the negotiation from a distance.

          17 EXT. DOCK - DAY (MINUTES LATE) 17

          Jason and Henry walk through the hubbub.

          The Chinese CHEF in the busy, steamy kitchen is inspecting
          the shark fins Jason has brought him. Jason is anxious to
          finish business and go.

                         CHEF
          You no like my company? Fine. Who
          cares. Bring me more fin, you
          retire. You no want to retire?
          Good. Don't charge starving Chinese
          so much for these things.

                         JASON
          You ever caught a shark?

          Lemme -- lemme show you something.
          Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display
          a fresh gash across his arm.

                         JASON
          He was already gaffed onto the side
          of the boat, good as dead. Two
          hours dead! And I was still too
          close to the mouth. Revenge is the
          last instinct to go, did you know
          that?
          The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.

                         CHEF
          -- Work's a dangerous thing.
          (smiling with lots of

                         TEETH)

          He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps
          the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS.

          Jason has fallen asleep while Alex drives. Alex picks up
          Jason's hand. Jerking awake, Jason tries to pull away,
          but his reflexes are sleep-slowed. Alex sniffs Jason's
          fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back.

          You stink.

                         JASON

          Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one,
          rubs his hands.

                         ALEX
          ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I
          really am. When you didn't want to
          go to college, I took your side, I
          said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish
          college, and I've done all right.
          I gave you a job', a steady check,
          which is more than anybody else has
          done. And what do I get back?
          Shit. I've tried to teach you the

          tuned to the FOOTBALL GAME.

                         ALEX
          Hi, mike -- what's the score?

          Don't underestimate Marino.
          Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate.

                         MIKE
          I told you, they don't have it this
          year.
          With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto
          the grounds.

          Alex cruises past a collection of oversized villas, and
          turns into the driveway of the gaudiest. He and Jason
          climb out of the car. Alex opens the trunk. He loads two
          wine cases into Jason's arms, takes the third himself.
          They haven't said a word to each other.

                         25

          25 EXT. VILLA - DAY

          Alex rings the intercom with his elbow. Gabriella's VOICE
          CRACKLES in response.

          The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching.
          The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked.
          Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of
          clean burp cloths.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh, the boss himself!

                         ALEX
          (with a modest chuckle)
          How are you?
          She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting
          what she sees. A circuit connects between them.

                         ALEX
          Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese.

                         (TO GABRIELLA)
          This is my stepson, Jason.

                         (VERY CORRECT)
          How do you do.

          Hi.

                         GABRIELLA
          Is the wine for the boat? Come
          through the house.

           They follow her inside. Jason takes in the richness of
           the place, but is more focussed on Gabriella. They exit

          27 EXT. REESES' BOAT DAY

          A sleek, ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock, the
          crew unobtrusively at work. FRANK REESE, a powerful,
          confidant man in his mid-sixties, is sitting with his
          INSURANCE AGENT at a table on deck where policies are
          spread out next to a jewelry box. Reese's expensive 35-
          year-old wife DINA has turned her chair to sun her legs
          while she plays with the BABY.

                         DINA
          -- what's the point of having it, if
          I can't wear it, Frank?

                         AGENT

                         (DEFERENTIALLY)
          You can wear it anywhere you like,
          Mrs. Reese -- except out of the
          country.
          Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex
          and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at
          Dina's long legs.. She smiles.

                         FRANK
          Alex, should we insure the wine
          while we're at it?
          His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case.

                         ALEX
          Aren't you covered on your home
          policy?

                         GABRIELLA

                         (TO JASON)
          I'll show you, come on.

                         AGENT
          How much wine are we talking about?
          Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck
          fading.

          DINA (O.S.)
          Why bother insuring it? Let's drink
          it instead.

          It's quiet inside, not tasteful but impressive, like
          everything else of the Reeses. Jason takes a stab at
          conversation.

                         JASON
          Big boat.
          Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him.
          They're both kids.

                         GABRIELLA
          ugly, isn't it.
          He grins and relaxes, looks around.

                         JASON
          The fittings are definitely -- yeah
          on the ugly side. But damn, she's
          solid.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh, a boat type.

                         JASON
          (proud, defensive)
          I like.boats.
          Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet
          next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while
          she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.

                         JASON
          So where you headed?

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm not going, 'I can't go.

                         JASON
          They don't want to take the baby.

                         GABRIELLA
          Iâ€¢don't have a green card, I can't
          leave the country. Baby goes with
          an American nurse. I house-sit.
          It's fine.

                         JASON
          You don't like them.
          Gabriella laughs.

          He chafes under authority the same way she does.

                         JASON
          Doesn't have to be.

                         GABRIELLA

          He laughs.

          from.

                         GABRIELLA
          Well, I don't. My mother's Indian.
          The India kind of Indian.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Imagine a house where the father
          asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish,
          and the mother answers 'Curry' in
          Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she
          says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He
          says, 'No es importante.' No wonder
          I'm nuts.

                         JASON
          You don't seem too nuts.

          29 EXT. BOAT, THE DECK - DAY

           The agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a
          velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties.
          Alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the
          remaining case on deck.

                         AGENT
          -- so back to the safe it goes --
          Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.

                         FRANK
          Dina, that's disgusting.

                         DINA
          The alternative is using your
          fingers, Frank. which offends you
          more?
          Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.

                         FRANK
          Don't encourage her, Alex. Her
          mouth is big enough.
          Dina is hurt.

                         FRANK
          (to the agent)
          I'll show you that painting in our
          stateroom.
          The agent follows him away.

                         ALEX
          (kindly; to Dina)
          Do you want to see the label?
          She hides her hurt by not looking at him.

                         DINA
          Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us
          both a glass. I'm not allowed to
          drink alone.
          When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.

          Jason has almost finished storing the wine. Gabriella is
          sitting on a bar stool at the galley,. listening to him,
          snared by the quiet passion in his voice.

                         JASON
          -- when you're skimming along the
          water, nothing between you and the
          bottom of the sea but a layer of
          wood, your thoughts... end. All
          that noise inside your head?
          Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.

                         JASON
          . . . Stops.
          Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of
          them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of
          apology to Jason.

          DINA (V.O.)
          Gabriella? Are you down there?

                         GABRIELLA
          Yes, Mrs. Reese.

          DINA (V.0.)
          The baby needs you. And bring a
          pacifier for Frank.

                         GABRIELLA
          Right there.
          She slides off the stool.

                         JASON
          You should come out with me
          sometime.
          She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes
          follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the
          remaining case of wine for him to stock.

          31 EXT. BOAT - DAY 31

          Gabriella. lifts the fussy baby from Dina, her hands sure
          and calming. She coos nonsense to his little ear as she-
          reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm.

          Gabriella?
          (off her nod)
          Want to take this with you?
          He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops
          the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.

                         FRANK
          Put it on my desk.
          He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass,
          and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.

                         FRANK
          Are we all set, Alex?

                         ALEX
          I'm going to check the storage room,
          see what else'll travel. I know I
          put some vintage Armagnac in there,
          maybe some Porto?
          He heads down the gangplank.

                         FRANK
          He's a vendor, Dina. It's like
          drinking with the help.

                         DINA

                         (DISARMING HIM)
          Did you pick the wine, sweetie?
          It's lovely.
          Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her
          shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor
          present, the agent.

                         AGENT

                         (AWKWARDLY)
          So I'll messenger over the rider for

          Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:

          -- You still here?
          Dina laughs, too.

          Gabriella settles the baby on his side, the only Reese she
          likes. She starts to close the shutters. Lullaby MUSIC
          is playing on the baby's TAPE DECK.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          She closes the nursery door as softly as possible. A
          man's hands go around her throat. Her gasp dies
          stillborn. It's Alex, kissing her.ear, holding Dina's
          diamond necklace to her neck.

          Look how beautiful you are. He's an
          idiot if he didn't.
          Now she sees the necklace.

                         GABRIELLA
          What are you doing?
          She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs
          down the hall to Frank's study.

          IN THE STUDY
          She tries td stuff it in the pouch. Alex is right behind
          her.

                         GABRIELLA
          You're going to get me fired and

          Just put it on for a minute. Look
          at yourself.
          She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so
          tempting.

                         ALEX
          See what you deserve.

          Alex moves her hair away. She lets him hook the necklace
          around her neck. He reaches over to open the closet door,
          fitted out now as a file cabinet, but with the original
          closet mirror still in place. The safe is visible.
          Gabriella stares at her reflection, Alex behind her,
          watching her. The necklace changes her posture. She
          angles her chin slightly, twists back her hair. Diamonds
          suit her.

          He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She
          doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror.

          Alex blows out a frustrated breath.

          Ah... shit...
          He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the
          pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that
          had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the
          pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes
          the closet door.
          Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of
          the stairs.

          He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by
          the terrace doors, where he left it.

          A poker game is breaking up. Five players, Alex among
          them. He's done all right. DAVE -- an older man -- has
          lost. He tosses down his cards.

          Dave. So do I. Or else why get up
          in the morning.
          VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's
          tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted
          glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a
          hurry.

          as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the
          room. Alex puts on his jacket.

          Paltry pickings tonight.
          Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table.

          Sure. Why not.
          He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex
          fans the deck across the table.

          This, more or less.
          He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up.
          A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth.

          gaze clicks from the photo to Alex, back to the photo. He
          slowly reaches out and picks it up.

                         VICTOR
          Very pretty. I remember when it
          was the cover of the auction
          catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's
          baubles. Bought for a young wife,
          I remember. Who I'm sure worked
          just as hard as the Duchess.

          ... Sure, this afternoon's fine.
          Hanging up, he rocks back in his chair and squeezes his
          eyes shut. Then he rests his forehead against the heels
          of his hands for a moment, considering what he's
          considering.

          41 INT. WINE SHOP - DAY 41

          Alex walks through. Jason's on a ladder stocking the
          shelves.

                         ALEX
          You want to hand me down a good
          cognac? I'm going out to the
          Reeses.

          He wants to talk.
          He dusts off the bottle.

          42 INT. VILLA - DAY - 42

          Alex follows Dina down a narrow service hall to the wine
          room. She talks without looking back at him.

                         DINA
          -- enough of an investment in there --

                         ALEX
          -- not to want to take a chance,
          with a month away. That's what I
          thought.

          Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier.

                         ALEX
          Second honeymoon.

                         DINA
          The first one was bad enough.
          She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to
          maneuver away. He fiddles with the box.

                         ALEX
          -- It may need a part replaced.

                         DINA
          Nice suit. You always dress well,
          Alex.
          She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand
          there.

                         (GENTLY)

          She moves up against him. Alex can't will himself to
          resist. His knee automatically separates her legs. He
          reaches out to close the door.

          43 INT. VILLA, THE HALLWAY - DAY

          Gabriella is-returning from the laundry room with an arm
          load of clean crib sheets. Knowing Alex and Dina are
          inside the wine room, she stops and knocks on the door.

                         GABRIELLA
          Mrs. Reese? The baby's ready for

                         YOU-
          A long moment later, the door opens. Dina and Alex are
          reassembled, but there's a tension and a breathlessness
          about them Gabriella recognizes.

                         DINA
          -- Thank you, Gabriella.
          Dina spies some interaction between Gabriella and Alex,
          and her pretty face hardens.

                         DINA
          Did you leave him by himself?

                         GABRIELLA
          Just to get his sheets.

                         DINA
          That's the maid's job.

                         GABRIELLA
          He's in his playpen.
          Dina sweeps out.

                         DINA
          Baby jail.
          She looks over her shoulder to make sure Gabriella is
          behind her.

                         DINA
          Are you coming?

                         (TO ALEX)

          Alex climbs the open stairs, heads down the cantilevered
          walkway, knocks at Victor's door.
          For an instant Alex doesn't recognize the uniformed
          repairman who opens it: Victor, disguised.

                         VICTOR

                         (TICKLED)

          45 INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          By daylight the apartment looks shabby.

          I think I look younger, don't you?

                         ALEX
          You look ridiculous.

                         VICTOR
          Fine. I don't have an ego.

          Victor opens the front door.-

                         VICTOR
          After you.
          As Alex walks toward the door, he catches sight of a free-
          standing hospital respirator in the bedroom. He looks at
          Victor, who waits for him with an unchanging smile. They
          go out together.

          stops him, opens the driver's door.

          Alex goes into the booth, finds the appointment board,

          that opens the gate.

          49 INT. CADILLAC - DAY 49

          Alex slides back behind the wheel. Victor is resting his
          head on the back of the seat.

          Brilliant, Alex. We've violated the
          law before we even get started.

          I was helping you out. I checked
          off the appointment, didn't you see

          (with a snigger)
          Don't pay to be too good-looking in

          You don't have papers, they don't

                         GABRIELLA
          ... Are you old enough to vote?
          She slides behind the wheel.

          You're not too much older. Are you
          going past the wharf? You can gimme
          a ride.
          He's already walking around the car to get in the other
          side. Gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches
          over to unlock the door for him.

          Jason laughs.

                         JASON
          Like they're a factory?

                         GABRIELLA
          The size of their staff? It is.

                         JASON

          Not for the wharf.

          I know. Just turn!
          She whips the car through the turn, narrowly missing
          another car.

          sabotaged but doesn't remark on it.

          Mike starts down the stairs. Alex signals to Victor that
          he's going with him and follows Mike away. Victor waits
          until he hears the DOOR CLOSE before dropping down through
          the hatch and heading for Frank's office.

          57 EXT. MIAMI RIVER - DAY

          Gabriella watches Jason walk with a long stride toward
          Henry's boat. She likes the way he moves. Henry is
          nearby drinking beer with some Haitians. Jason talks to
          him for a moment. Henry glances down the walkway to
          Gabriella, then hands Jason his. keys. Jason gestures to
          Gabriella to come down.

          Victor, wearing surgical gloves, is in the file closet
          cracking the safe. He has re-wired the alarm wire with
          electrical clips to avoid breaking the circuit. He smears
          the sweat off his forehead and leans back in close to the
          dial, rotating it carefully back and forth until the
          tumblers fall. It opens. victor sifts through papers,
          foreign currency.

          Jason drops anchor in turquoise waters off a sand bar, no
          other boats around. Gabriella takes in the idyllic
          surroundings.

          He's dead. He drowned in a storm.
          She shivers involuntarily.

          He was a fisherman.

          water.

          -- Eight. I'd just turned eight.
          She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers
          and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the
          emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this.
          She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek.
          They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse,
          kisses her on the lips.

          it, picks up the phone, punches in the number she wrote.

                         ALEX
          ... May I speak with Gabriella?
          Puedo hablar con Gabriella?
          (making a face)
          No, yo no quiero dejar un mesajo,
          gracias. Voy a llamarla mas tarde.
          ...Si. Buenas tardes.
          He hangs up and speed-dials a number from the typed list
          on the wall.

                         ALEX
          ... Hey, Ted -- it's Alex Gates. I
          need a couple of tickets to New York
          for tonight, first class.
          (his jaw tightens)
          Don't sweat the account, I'll pay

                         CASH --

                         66

          66 EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the-
          boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in
          her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand
          back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (SOFTLY)
          I can't.
          He sits up, offended.

                         JASON
          You waited long enough to tell me.
          Gabriella arranges her clothes.

                         (FLARING)
          Because it felt good, and I'm an
          idiot!
          He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand.

                         JASON
          No, you're not.
          She scrambles to her feet.

                         GABRIELLA
          I want to go back now. Can we go
          back, please?

                         JASON
          ... Sure.
          He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with
          injured dignity.
          Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in
          front of her.
          Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and
          her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does.
          She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion.
          He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over
          the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to

          CLANK.

                         JASON
          I'm sorry.
          She turns her head toward him.

                         GABRIELLA
          What?

                         JASON

          67 EXT. MIAMI RIVER - DUSK

          A bridge has parted. Underneath, the boat makes its way
          on the opalescent water.

          Skyscrapers swagger down either side of the river, their
          windows bright squares against the darkening sky. The
          signal BELL SOUNDS.

          68 INT. GABRIELLA'S COUSIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The dinner hour. The table in the mean little house is
          too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet
          can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband
          are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the
          Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets
          up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder.
          Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the
          noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says
          Gabriella's snooty.

                         69

          69 INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Gabriella stands at the counter, listlessly finishing her
          dinner. The PHONE RINGS. She answers it.

          Reeses. We're taking a trip, honey.

          The tension drains from her face; rescued.

          Where are we going?

          ALEX (V.O.)

          Sure.

          ALEX (V.0.)
          Don't worry, it's not Ohio.
          She laughs.

          72 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT 72

          Suzanne turns onto their street, pulls into the garage.
          She sees Alex's Cadillac already parked.

          73 EXT. CAR - NIGHT 73

          She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying
          a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker
          than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls.
          She walks a little faster.

          74 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 74

          Suzanne lets herself in. Alex didn't set the alarm. She
          sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been
          a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up
          the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses
          the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne
          smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to
          see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in
          a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the
          bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing
          with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.

          75 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 75

          Alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where
          he can reach it. He has almost finished packing. As he
          reaches for his underwear, he startles. Suzanne is
          leaning against the door frame.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CONTROLLED)

          Napa. I got a problem with a
          supplier. Boutique wineries --
          they're all owned by ex-lawyers.

                         SUZANNE
          Via New York?
          She holds up the tickets.

                         ALEX
          I need to see the wholesaler.

                         SUZANNE
          You're amazing, you really are. Now
          how are you going to explain 'Miss
          Vasquez?'

                         ALEX
          Honey, I don't have to. I will, out
          of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's
          fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the
          agent.

                         SUZANNE
          God, I could even believe you, if I
          wanted to.

                         (HARDER)
          I don't want to fight with you on my
          way out the door. I don't have time
          for this.
          Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react,
          he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the
          stairs.

                         SUZANNE
          I put Terry's life insurance money
          into that store -- and you spend it
          on your goddamn girlfriends while my
          checks bounce.
          Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.

                         ALEX
          I worked my ass off for you with
          that store. Eight years of twelve-
          hour days and one-day weekends! So
          don't tell me I haven't treated you
          well.

          He picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on.
          Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table.
          Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away
          behind her back.

                         SUZANNE
          -- You're going to talk to me!

                         ALEX
          When I get back.

          With more of your fucking lies! I
          hate you! Wasting my

          Sssh, calm down --
          She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.

                         ALEX
          -- Give me my keys, I need my keys.
          I don't want to hurt you.

                         SUZANNE
          That's all you ever do!
          He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto
          the sofa.

                         SUZANNE
          Go to hell!
          He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up
          and up. She grips his keys tighter.

          Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers.
          She drives her elbow into his face.

                         SUZANNE
          You sonofabitch!
          He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop
          to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes
          a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across
          the temple.

          The blow sends him sprawling to the floor; he doesn't
          move. She is stunned by what she has done. In a panic
          she races up the stairs, the heel of her hand to her nose
          to staunch the bleeding.

                         76

          76 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Suzanne spills everything out of Alex's suitcase and
          starts throwing in her own clothes, blood-spotting them in
          her haste.

          Suzanne jerks out his drawers so fast that she dumps them
          on the floor. She pulls his suit out of the closet along
          with an armful of other clothes.

          78 INT. CONDO, STAIRS - NIGHT 78

          Suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs.

                         ALEX
          hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and
          squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches
          the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her
          breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.

          79 EXT. CONDO - NIGHT 79

          Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right
          into Jason. She cries out in fright.

          Ready to kill, Jason is shocked to see the job apparently
          already done for him. He bends over Alex to see if he's
          dead, and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he
          isn't.

          SUZANNE (O.S.)

          Alex's unconscious body blocks the closet. door. Jason
          tries to open it anyway, but Alex is 'too heavy. Seizing
          hold of him, Jason drags him away from the door. The
          jewelry pouch spills out of Alex's pocket. Jason doesn't
          see it. The HORN BLARES, outside. Jason pulls his rod out
          of the closet. As he steps over Alex, he spots the pouch,
          the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude.
          The HORN BLASTS again. Jason swoops up the pouch.

          83 EXT. CONDO.- NIGHT 83

          Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in.
          Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.

                         JASON
          Pull over, pull over.
          He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb.

                         JASON
          I'm driving.

                         85

          85 EXT. CAR - NIGHT

          He gets out and lopes around the car to the driver's side.
          The car recedes down the highway.

          86 EXT. GABRIELLA'S COUSIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Gabriella is sitting on the front step with her suitcase,
          waiting. She rubs her legs as though she has been there
          a long time. The DOGS are BARKING inside.

                         87

          87 INT. CONDO - NIGHT

           The PHONE is RINGING. Alex still hasn't moved.

          88 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          Jason is waiting behind the wheel.
          Suzanne gets back in the car. She has pulled a cotton
          sweater over her bloody clothes and washed her face.
          She's presentable again, and subdued. He starts the

          Did you figure out where we're
          going?

                         JASON
          We'll head for the Gulf, see what we
          like.
          He sounds like her contemporary, not her kid.

                         SUZANNE
          . I remember your dad saying the
          sand was as white as the whites of
          God's eyes, on the Gulf.

                         JASON
          Do you still miss him?
          Slowly she shakes her head no.

                         SUZANNE
          I can't see his face anymore. I
          can't hear his voice.

                         (DREAMILY)
          -- But when you come home from
          fishing -- with the sea and the salt
          and the engine oil? It's like he's
          walking through the door. I love
          that smell -- I can still smell him.
          She watches the highway posts clack past.

          90 INT. CONDO, KITCHEN - NIGHT 90

          Victor is soaking a dishtowel under the faucet. He wrings
          it out.

                         VICTOR
          Mugged-by your wife. How ironic.

          91 INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 91

          Victor comes into the room with the wet towel and throws
          it at Alex, who is sitting now on the couch. Alex catch:s
          it, holds it to his bloody head.

                         ALEX

          How long a drive is it?

                         ALEX
          To the Gulf? Three hours.
          He removes the towel from his head.

                         VICTOR
          You're going to need stitches. Do
          you have a sewing kit?

          92 EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 92

          Suzanne and Jason cross the parking lot toward the coffee
          shop, which anchors a suburban surface mall. He notices
          a jewelry store. They reach the restaurant. He opens the
          door for Suzanne.

                         JASON
          Order something for me, okay? I'm
          stiff, I need to walk around.
          He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation
          cancel each other; she goes inside.

          93 INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 93

          Jason approaches the cheerful, elderly JEWELER repairing
          an earring behind the case. The man puts away his smile.
          Jason's long hair and leather jacket offend him.

                         JASON
          My grandmother asked me to bring in
          a necklace of hers --
          Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces
          it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans
          forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with
          a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.

          Your grandmother lets you carry
          around a million dollars worth of
          jewelry? Go put it back where you
          found it.
          The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches
          it closed, slaps it on top of the case.

                         JASON
          -- Those aren't real diamonds.

                         JEWELER
          Tell your grandmother to bring it
          in.
          The jeweler BUZZES the door to release it. Jason grabs
          the velvet pouch, strides out.

          94 INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 94

          The WAITRESS unloads plate after plate on the table where
          Suzanne is waiting for Jason.

                         WAITRESS

          The waitress laughs as she strolls away.

                         SUZANNE
          I'm hungry.
          He's worried about the jeweler.

                         JASON
          Let's pack it up, picnic on the
          beach someplace.

                         SUZANNE

          What a romantic.

          As Jason and Suzanne reach the car, he sees the jeweler on
          the sidewalk now, outside the store, gesticulating to a
          sign painter.

                         JASON

                         MOM --
          He wants to tell her he took the necklace.

                         (BREEZILY)
          -- No, 1111 drive.
          The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason
          ducks into the car, unnoticed.

          96 EXT. PIER - DAY 96

          Jason and Suzanne are sitting on a small, rickety pier,
          eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps.

                         SUZANNE
          -- I feel... exhilarated.

                         JASON
          Adrenalin does that.

                         SUZANNE
          -- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom.
          And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it
          overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea.

                         SUZANNE

                         (EXULTANT)

          I can't believe you did that.

          97 INT. CAR - LATE DAY (TRAVEL?NG) 97

          Suzanne is driving now. She glances over at Jason
          sprawled low in the seat.

                         SUZANNE
          You're quiet.
          She doesn't think he's going to answer her.

          It'll work itself out. People
          manage. We're here. This is what
          you always wanted.

                         JASON
          -- How much money do we have?
          Suzanne doesn't reply.

          98 EXT. MOTEL - LATE DAY 98

          At the reception window Suzanne is checking in with the
          MOTEL OWNER, a solidly-built, ruddy woman in her fifties
          who shouldn't wear sleeveless blouses. Suzanne has her
          wallet open. Her fingers hesitate at the credit card.

                         OWNER
          There's a cash discount. Ten
          percent.

                         SUZANNE

                         (SMILING)
          Sounds like cash.
          She starts to count it out.

          99 EXT. MOTEL POOL - LATE DAY 99

          Ensconced at a table under an umbrella, Jason is writing
          on a paper towel.

          JASON (V.O.)
          Dear Gabriella. I don't know if
          you'll get this letter. I don't
          know if I'll send it. All I know is
          that for some reason I need to write
          it...

          SUZANNE AND THE OWNER
          cross the parking lot.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CALLING)

          He crumples the paper towel. She holds up the keys for
          him to see.

                         SUZANNE
          He's my son.
          The owner gives her a startled glance.

                         OWNER
          You look great!
          Suzanne laughs.

          100 EXT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 100

          Jason is sitting on the lawn chair outside the room door,
          working on his letter again under the yellow bug light.
          The Coke MACHINE HUMS noisily next to him.

          JASON (V.0.)
          That day on the boat made me realize

          Suzanne stirs awake, disoriented, spooked.

          Jason?
          She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside.

                         JASON
          I'm right here.
          Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows
          to clear her voice.

                         SUZANNE
          ... I dreamed I was in jail. You'd
          come to see me, you were on the
          other side of the plastic -- like at
          the bank?. And you were talking, but
          I couldn't hear you. I put my ear
          to the holes and I couldn't hear
          you, but your mouth was moving.

          A tint combed through her hair, the plastic cap tied in a
          rakish bow, Suzanne lays out what remains of her cash by
          denomination. She records the amount in a pocket notebook
          she's using as a ledger.

          Jason is fishing.

          JASON (V.0.)
          -- I caught a fish that had three
          hooks grown through his lips. Three
          times he'd gotten away. He kept
          taking the hook.

          Jason is gutting and skinning his catch.

          JASON (V.0.)
          It occurs to me that you're the
          fisherman, not me. I can feel the
          tension of the line. I've taken the
          hook just like he did.

                         CUT TO:

          A MAP OF THE GULF 106
          Coastal towns have been crossed out, one after the other.

          107 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 107

          Alex, stitches in his head, pores over the map while
          Victor talks on the phone. He circles a new town on the
          Gulf, farther north.

                         VICTOR
          -- eight-faceted cut... quite
          unique... could be the whole piece
          or individual stones, preference for

                         (LAUGHING)
          No, I'm consulting for the
          insurance company, isn't life
          strange? -- Love and kisses.
          He hangs up. His cheeriness vanishes. He coughs, more
          like a gag, and heads for the bathroom.

          108 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 108

          Victor spits blood in the sink. Then, after catching his
          breath, squirts medicine down his throat with his inhaler,
          exits.

          Victor picks up a chair and smacks it down.

                         ALEX
          Hey! What's wrong?

                         VICTOR
          This is not a water-view suite in
          Marbella! Did you notice? There's
          no fruit and champagne from the
          management. I don't see Swiss
          chocolate on the pillows. My
          masseuse is not at the door. And I
          am fucking dying, Alex!

                         ALEX

                         (SHOCKED)
          Jesus. Victor.

                         VICTOR
          I don't intend to cough to death in
          a county clinic because you screwed
          up!

                         ALEX

                         (QUIETLY)
          That's not fair. The plan was for
          you to move the necklace. I
          wouldn't have had the goddamn thing.
          Come on... sit down... try to relax.
          He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the
          package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes.

                         VICTOR
          I'm not good at giving up things.

          110 â€¢ INT. DOCKSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 110

          Jason eats a sandwich at a'table, working on his letter.

          JASON (V.0.)
          I want to take you out with me when
          the wind's blowing whitecaps and the
          current's running against the wind,
          just to hear your hair slap against
          your skin. When will I see you?
          He glances up.

          her hair a better, brighter color under her chef's hat, is
          cooking on the grill behind the counter, kidding the

          pats her rump as he goes by, not for the first time.

                         SUZANNE
          Long arms, short dick, they always

          One of the Fishermen guffaws. The owner looks pissed. So
          does Jason who witnessed it all.

          111 INT. MOTEL - DAY 111

          Suzanne luxuriates in a. bubble bath, a glass of wine in
          her hand, the bottle next to the tub. She's talking to
          Jason through the closed door.

                         SUZANNE
          I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit.

          112 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 112

          Jason is prying a diamond out of the necklace with his
          fishing knife.

          SUZANNE (O.S.)
          (with a laugh)
          For about a minute it was very
          satisfying.

          You did the right thing.

          113 EXT. SECOND JEWELRY STORE - DAY 113

           Jason has put on his suit, changed his looks. He sizes up
          the store.

          Help you?

                         JASON
          Do you buy estate diamonds?

                         JEWELER
          Sure.
          Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter,
          one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with
          respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous,
          it doesn't show.

                         JASON
          It belonged to my mother.
          The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care.

                         JEWELER -
          .Price is the same. I can give you
          eighty-five hundred.

          115 EXT. BEACH - DAY 115

          The classified section already folded and marked beside
          her, Suzanne has propped herself on her elbows. She's
          looking out to sea. Talking heads bob like buoys, the
          waders. She notices, some distance away, a man in a suit
          walking along the beach. The image amuses her. He's
          moving in her direction. She finally recognizes Jason and
          raises her hand.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hey, sailor...
          She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim
          she admires his approach.

                         SUZANNE
          (as he reaches her)
          ... Look at you. What's the
          occasion?
          Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.

                         JASON
          You don't need another grab-ass job.

          She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel.

                         SUZANNE
          So we're packing.
          They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls
          out to Suzanne.

                         MAN
          Hey, I thought you were coming back
          in.
          She smiles and waves goodbye.

          ... Too bad. I kinda liked that

          116 INT. BAR - NIGHT

          Alex is smelling his brandy in a booth. He looks
          defeated. Victor swings onto a bar stool. He takes out
          a wallet photo of Suzanne and Jason and passes it across
          to the BARTENDER.

                         VICTOR
          Seen them, by any chance?

                         BARTENDER
          Why are you asking?

                         VICTOR
          My wife and son. He's been selling
          fish around these parts.
          He's totally believable. The bartender feels for his pain
          and takes another look at the photo, shakes his head no.

                         BARTENDER
          She's a little classier than our
          usual clientele, y'know?

                         VICTOR
          Maybe you could pass it down anyway.

          Sure, man.

                         VICTOR
          joins Alex in the booth. Victor raises his hand. Alex
          instinctively pulls his head back.

                         VICTOR
          Don't move.
          He leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out
          of Alex's wound. Alex winces.

                         VICTOR
          It's been irritating me all day.
          Did I hurt you?
          Threat implied. Alex stares him down.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know this kid --
          Alex and victor glance over to the bar and see Henry.
          He's looking at the photo Victor passed around.

                         HENRY
          Hunches a catch like a depth finder.
          Victor is already out of the booth.

          VICTOR AND HENRY
          Henry senses money to be made.

                         HENRY
          Who are you?

                         VICTOR
          His father.

                         HENRY
          I thought his father was dead.
          (shaking his head)
          Well, you look bad all right, but
          not dead.

                         VICTOR

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          Hungover, that's all. I'm his

          victor's insulted enough to lose his patience and his
          poise.

                         VICTOR
          The question before us is where did
          he go.
          Henry says nothing. He wants to be paid. Victor whips
          out a fifty-dollar bill from his top pocket. Henry
          reaches for it, but victor holds it back, wanting an
          answer first.

                         HENRY
          He wouldn't be on the Gulf. He
          hated the Gulf.
          Alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him,
          unnoticed. He shakes his head at victor.

                         HENRY
          He's down in the Keys somewhere.
          Victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket. Henry
          stands aggressively.

                         HENRY
          That ain't cool in my book!
          In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down
          on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex
          slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling
          over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright.

                         VICTOR

                         (EVENLY)
          Now sit there,. and calm down.
          Victor is ill, but not weak. Henry looks away, the
          classic signal of submission.

                         VICTOR

          118 EXT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 118

           From a distance we see Jason follow a beefy, jeans-wearing
           salesman into the building.

          119 ' INT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 119

          The Salesman walks Jason past the vertical rows of boats,
          stacked from ceiling to floor, extolling the virtues of
          his stock. Jason inspects a modest boat, takes out cash.

          120 EXT. GULF - BOAT - DAY 120

          Jason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat, THE
          HERCULES II, old and not too big, but with good lines.
          He's purely happy.

          121 EXT. WATER - DAY

          Jason steers toward the beach and drops anchor. There's
          a cabin among the palmettos. No car.

                         122

          122 INT. CABIN - DAY

          Jason comes into the cabin.

                         JASON
          (just to be sure)
          Mom?
          The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop
          loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a
          square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the
          studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his
          tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically
          starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold.

                         123

          123 EXT. CABIN - DAY

          Suzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and
          sets them on the porch. She opens the door.

                         124

          124 INT. CABIN - DAY

          Just as Suzanne steps through the screen door, Jason sees
          that his tackle box is open, the velvet pouch in plain
          sight. He kicks the top closed, bends to lock it.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CASUALLY)
          They'll think you stole it.
          He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the
          kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She
          looks out the window at the boat again.

                         SUZANNE
          Nice boat.
          (over her shoulder)
          Are you allowed just to run around
          with it?
          'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box.

          I forgot my tackle box.

          125 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Alex is sitting on the bed, dialing a number. He can see
          Victor shirtless in the bathroom. (His scars surprise
          us). Victor is trying with effort to suppress a cough.

                         126

          126 INT. CONDO, KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Gabriella is cooking herself dinner.

                         GABRIELLA
          Hello?
          She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice.

                         GABRIELLA
          -- Hi! I saw on the news there's
          rain in San Francisco. Are you wet
          and miserable?

                         127

          127 INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          Exhausted, Alex stretches out on the bed to talk to her.

                         ALEX
          Napa's farther north.
          Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news.

          128 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 128

          She leans on the counter, flirting with his voice.

                         GABRIELLA
          Tell me you love me.

          ALEX (V.0.)
          I love you.
          Her smile vanishes.

                         GABRIELLA
          Who just laughed?

          She wants to talk to you.

                         VICTOR
          Oh, please. Why?

                         ALEX
          Just fucking say hello, okay?
          Victor takes the phone.

                         VICTOR
          Hello, dear.
          Alex snatches the phone back from him.

                         ALEX
          Happy? Satisfied? I'm working.

          130 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 130

          His harsh tone unsettles her.

                         GABRIELLA
          I miss you.

          ALEX (V.O.)
          Are there any messages?
          She carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail
          and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack.
          Her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope; she moves
          it out from the pile. It has been forwarded several
          times. And it's addressed to her.

                         GABRIELLA
          It's lonely here.
          There's no return address. She slits it open with her
          thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.

          ALEX (V.O.)
          What about the messages?

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm looking!
          Instead, she opens the letter.

          Gabby?
          She puts down the letter and quickly- finds the message
          memo.

                         GABRIELLA
          Here it is. Mr. Raines called from
          (NAME OF TOWN). He said you-Id know
          what it was about. Do you,- need the
          number?

          131 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 131

          Sitting up, Alex signals success to Victor and writes down
          the number.

                         ALEX
          Thanks, honey. I'll call-you
          tomorrow. G'd'night .
          He hangs up, excited. Victor has already started to pack.

          I'll save the party hats until it's
          in our hands.

          132 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 132

          Gabriella is reading the second page of Jason's letter.

          I look out at the flat blue sea, and
          the darker bl ue where the Gulf
          deepens and I want you next to me.
          â€¢I want to walk across the. sugar sand
          and wade into the water with you

          floats us, nothing weighting us down --
          as'light and thoughtless as fish.

          Victor and Alex kid each other without rancor for the
          moment.

          You have pimp's tastes, Alex. At
          least my car's inconspicuous.
          Alex starts to get out. Victor doesn't.

                         ALEX
          You all right?

                         VICTOR
          A lot of these jewelers might know
          my face. It's risky.

                         ALEX
          How about for me?
          Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and
          holds it up for him.

                         VICTOR
          Nobody's seen this yet.

                         ALEX
          You're sick. I'll do it.

          A game is on.

                         ALEX
          Smart lady. She lets Jason make the
          sale. They get caught, he's
          underage, and she don't know a
          thing. I gotta give her credit.

                         VICTOR
          You have interesting taste in women.
          Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get
          interested.

          139 EXT. DOCKS - LATE DAY

          A storm is blowing in, and Jason walks quickly along the
          docks to his boat and swings aboard.

          140 EXT. BOAT - LATE DAY

          The waves have already started to slap against the sides
          of the boat. Jason tosses over his fenders and secures
          them to protect the boat from the pilings. He starts
          toward the cabin. The lock has been popped. The door is
          slightly ajar. He hears a NOISE inside. He draws his
          knife.

                         141

          141 INT. CABIN - LATE DAY

          Jason throws open the door. A figure is bent over in the
          galley. It turns, and by the light of the refrigerator
          Jason recognizes Henry.

                         JASON
          Jesus, Henry... What the hell you
          doing?... How'd you know this was my
          boat??

                         HENRY
          I saw you cast off. Good little
          sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa --
          hear that?

                         JASON

                         (PARANOID)
          Where -- what??
          Henry rubs his stomach.

                         HENRY
          Right here, man. I ain't been
          eating my share since my fishing
          partner ran off. Without so much as
          goodbye/good luck.
          Jason blows out a breath.

                         JASON
          It's complicated.

                         HENRY

                         (NODDING)
          Always is.
          The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They
          hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason
          starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats
          the sandwich he made.

                         JASON
          So why are you on the Gulf?

          My baby finally sank on me. Right
          at the dock. I thought I'd work
          charter for awhile.
          (moving to help Jason
          with the latches)
          -- Need a crew?

                         JASON
          I don't know. Maybe.

                         HENRY
          That's not why I came looking for
          you.
          Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he
          surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment.

                         HIS HAND
          wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured.

                         JASON
          secures the engine hatch.

                         HENRY
          A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell
          him where you were. Sick old
          motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to
          say he was your stepfather.

                         JASON

                         (CAREFULLY)
          Maybe it was.

                         HENRY
          No, no, no, no -- this guy was not
          any kind of family man, if you know
          what I mean. So you're in some deep
          shit, because he wasn't a cop
          neither.

                         JASON
          -- What'd you tell him?
          Henry chuckles.

                         HENRY
          Lots of ways to make fifty bucks.
          Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter.

          You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is
          that the plan?
          Henry is hurt and offended.

                         HENRY

                         (WITH DIGNITY)
          No, man, I wouldn't stoop that low.
          And if I'd taken the fifty, I
          wouldn't have to be eating your
          shitbag sandwich neither.
          Jason steps back, ashamed of himself. He sits down to
          recover. Henry looks at him with a friend's concern.

                         HENRY
          You -- um -- you moving contraband,
          Jason?
          Jason shakes his head no.

                         HENRY
          This guy struck me as a serious
          problem.
          A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the
          cabin door.

          Take care of the boat?

          142 EXT. DOCKS - DUSK

          Jason lopes along the quay, toward the businesses at the
          far end. The sky is about to open.

                         143

          143 INT. FISH MARKET - DUSK

          Working behind the counter, Suzanne leans on her elbows,
          chatting up a customer. Jason comes through the back
          door. She turns.

                         JASON

          She anxiously follows him out the door.

                         THE CUSTOMER
          leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our
          view of him.
          It's Victor. A paper bag under his arm, he goes out the
          front door.

          144 EXT. FISH MARKET - DUSK

           The rain is sheeting down. Cars fishtail slightly on the
           grease not yet washed from the streets.

                         VICTOR
           reaches his car with a long stride; he can't run.

          Suzanne is driving. 'Jason has told her. He glances at
          her sideways. She takes a long breath. The rain speeds
          up. She switches on the wipers.

                         SUZANNE
          ... I should have gone through his
          pockets myself. It didn't occur to
          me. I was in such a panic. If I'd
          found the necklace, Jason? I'd have
          taken it, too.

          Victor and Alex spot Suzanne's car idling at the
          intersection. Victor is eating an apple from the bag.

                         ALEX
          There.

          -- I'm sorry.
          She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights.

                         SUZANNE
          It's okay. I'm the one who hit the
          bastard.

                         HER POV
          A small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a
          boat pass. She stamps down on the gas pedal. The car
          rockets forward.

          The bridge gate is lowering. Victor guns the car under
          the gate and across the pivoting bridge just as the gap
          opens.

                         VICTOR
          What a thrill.

                         THEIR POV
          Jason's white face is turned toward them in Suzanne's car.

                         ALEX
          Easy, easy -- he'll see us.

          Still with us.

                         SUZANNE
          Maybe it's just a tourist cruising
          around with his head up his butt.
          Neither of them believes that.

          I just need to talk to her.

          truck HORN BLASTS.

                         SUZANNE
          -- Shit!
          She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing
          she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm
          across Jason to protect him.
           The car rolls onto its top, scraping across the road.

          153 EXT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT

          The upside-down car rips through a fence, slides down off
          the road. The engine dies. The only SOUND is the
          SPINNING back TIRE and the WINDSHIELD that now caves in.

                         154

          154 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          Victor swerves to the side of the road. Alex leaps out of
          the car and runs toward the wreck. Victor follows at a
          slower pace, opening his umbrella. He's still eating his
          apple. He sees a neighboring house light come on in
          response to the crash.

          AT THE WRECK
          Alex is trying to open the jammed door when Victor reaches
          him.

          We don't have much time.
          Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both
          unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne
          is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches
          in spasm.
          Car headlights pass by on the road.

                         ALEX
          We need to get some help!

          The car is rocked far enough forward on its hood to enable

          -- Oh, Christ...
          He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses
          the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the
          bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his
          other hand he pats down her body.

          I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just'
          tell me where it is.
          She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and
          feels inside. He goes through her purse.

                         ALEX
          Goddammit!
          Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's

                         (WEAKLY)
          Let go of me!
          Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms.
          An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse.

                         ORDERLY
          We'll take care of him.

           Alex hesitates, then goes out.

          164 INT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY

          Alex is conferring quietly with a staff member behind the
          counter.

          165 EXT. SUZANNE'S CABIN - DAY 165

          Victor picks the lock. Alex doesn't follow him inside.

          166 INT. CABIN - DAY 166

          Victor hits every spot where amateurs hide their
          treasures.

          A SERIES OF CUTS 167
          A) Victor's hand lifts the tub drain.
          B) Victor feels the back of a dresser.

                         VICTOR

                         (CALLING OUT)
          It'd be nice to have some help.
          C) Victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink.
          D) Et cetera.

          168 EXT. CABIN - DAY 168

          Alex is sitting on the stairs, staring out at the Gulf.
          He gives no indication of having heard Victor.

          169 INT. CABIN - DAY 169

          Victor lays his cheek along the living room wall to
          eyeball it for irregularity. A smile hoists his cheeks.
          He pops the paneling loose. His smile collapses. The
          niche carved between the'studs is empty. He rests his
          head against the wall.

          170 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Alex walks down the corridor to Jason's room. He taps on
          the door. There's no answer. He pushes open the door.
          The room is empty, the bed stripped.
          Alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young
          DOCTOR he sees walking down the hall.

                         ALEX
          Where's my son??

                         DOCTOR

                         (PUZZLED)
          I released him this morning.

                         ALEX
          You let an underage boy with a head
          injury walk out of here by himself??

                         DOCTOR
          It was only a concussion. He's
          fine. He said you were in the
          lobby.
           Nothing to be gained, Alex whirls around and strides away.

                          171

          171 EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Jason is running down the road, his face contorted.

                          172

          172 EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Jason keeps running onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes
          and plunges into the water and swims. Swims until he's
          exhausted and gasping. He tips his head back in the water
          and screams his grief to the pitiless sky.

                         173

          173 EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A truck pulls over, Jason swings down and waves goodbye.

                          174

          174 EXT. CONDO - NIGHT

          Jason appears, walking down the street. He looks into the
          garage. Seeing Alex's Cadillac, he smiles a tight smile.

                         175

          175 INT. CONDO - NIGHT

          Jason unlocks the door and starts turning of f the alarm

          The lights are off. He closes the door and starts up the
          stairs.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          His hand goes into his pocket as he advances on the master
          bedroom. He takes out his knife.

                         176

          176' INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He moves toward the bed.

                         JASON
          Wake up, Alex. I want to see your
          face.
          The sheets stir. Jason raises his knife to strike. But
          it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a
          strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his
          other hand. She's naked.

                         GABRIELLA
          Jason!
          (her eyes on his knife)
          -- Don't hurt me. Please.

                         JASON
          Where is he?

                         GABRIELLA
          He went to get you! He's not coming
          back until tomorrow.
          She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it
          off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He
          touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade
          â€¢ flat to her skin. She freezes.

                         JASON
          His car's here.

                         GABRIELLA
          It's been here since he went to
          Napa.

                         JASON
          I keep hearing about Napa. Did you
          ever call him there?
          She shakes her head.

                         JASON
          You don't know where he was.

          the knife.

          GABRIELLA.
          Why would he lie to me?
          Ever so lightly Jason's fingertips find her skin.

                         JASON
          You didn't waste any time,. did you.
          You moved right in.

          GABRIELLA.
          You don't need the knife.. Put. the
          knife down.
          She knows men and children well enough to demand, not beg.
          Jason has almost forgotten he still. has the knife against
          her. He lifts it and folds it and puts it away.

                         JASON
          I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm
          going to kill him.
          His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.

                         GABRIELLA
          They'll lock you up.

                         JASON
          Yeah.

                         GABRIELLA
          'Away from the sky and the air and
          the sea and the current running
          against the wind?' That was a very
          beautiful letter.
          Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her.

                         JASON
          Did you show it to him? You two
          have a laugh about it?

                         GABRIELLA
          I never mentioned itl
          Jason's hand curves around her throat,. a, caress, a threat.

                         JASON
          Did you tell him how to find: us-?
          Gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat.

                         JASON
          Sure, he did.

                         GABRIELLA
          He was glad she left.
          Jason lies down alongside her.

                         JASON
          He had us followed.

                         GABRIELLA
          W-why?
          He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.

                         GABRIELLA
          How do you know?
          She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.

                         JASON
          I'm not crazy.
          Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort
          him.

                         GABRIELLA
          ... I'm so very sorry about what
          happened to your mother.
          His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.

                         JASON
          Her loss, your gain.
          Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him
          hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on
          top of her and pins her down.

                         JASON
          Her home, her bed -- her life.
          He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is
          surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.

                         GABRIELLA
          . Don't do this for revenge.

          Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a
          sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances.
          His fingers scissor her nipple.

                         JASON
          Just don't tell me that you love me.
          He peels off his T-shirt.

                         GABRIELLA
          (in a whisper)
          I love you.
          He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes
          his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're
          both naked. They begin to make love.

                         GABRIELLA
          Wait.
          Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.

                         GABRIELLA
          This way.
          She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her.
          Jason moves now rapidly.

                         GABRIELLA
          Slowly.
          Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a
          young man in a long time.

                         (IN SPANISH)

                         (IN ENGLISH)
          Don't come, not yet.
          They move as one, their passion enveloping them.
          He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he
          also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face
          alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie
          side.by side.

                         GABRIELLA

          While he runs the water to'warm it, he looks at himself
          naked in the mirror. His face crumples. He no longer

          don't know how we live there.
          She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her
          nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.

          She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade

          Alex is too astonished to say a word. Jason and Gabriella
          are having lunch at the kitchen table.

          Alex sets down his suitcase.

                         ALEX
          I've been looking for you for two
          days!
          Jason relishes this.

                         JASON
          You should've called home.
          Alex advances.

                         ALEX
          How'd you get here?

                         JASON
          Hitchhiked.

                         GABRIELLA
          (too bright and

                         NERVOUS)
          Are you-hungry? Have you had lunch?
          Alex doesn't even hear her.

                         ALEX
          Why didn't you wait for me?
          Jason eats without answering.

                         ALEX
          And what about all your stuff, and
          your mother's?
          Jason swallows, wipes his mouth.

                         JASON
          She doesn't need it anymore, and I
          don't want it.
          Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee.

                         GABRIELLA
          How about a sandwich?

                         ALEX

                         (SNAPPISHLY)
          I'm not hungry. Jesus.

                         JASON

                         ALEX
          What are you doing.
          Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout
          clothes.

                         JASON
          Nothing.
          He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left
          alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.

                         GABRIELLA
          He just lost his mother, Alex. You
          can't expect him to act normal.
          He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her
          shoulders.

                         ALEX

                         (GENTLY)
          Did you try to make him feel better?

                         GABRIELLA
          (right back at him)
          Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat.
          She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom.

          183 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 183

          Alex comes into the room. She's sitting on the bed.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (SOFTLY)
          ... I feel like I made her die.
          Alex sits down beside her and takes her hand.

                         GABRIELLA
          I wanted her to go away so bad... I
          used to wish she'd die. And then
          she did.
          He lets go of her hand.

          (noticing her mouth)
          -- What happened to your mouth?
          Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh. -I bit my lip.
          He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.

                         (TENDERLY)
          Where? Here?... Better?
          She tries to laugh and nods. He holds her close.

          184 INT. CONDO WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

          Jason is working out alone in the little gym when in the
          mirror he sees Alex come through the door. He keeps
          lifting. Alex sits down on the bench beside him. Jason
          ignores him.

                         ALEX
          You have something that belongs to
          .me, Jason -- and I want it back.

                         JASON
          It's not yours.

                         ALEX

                         (HARDER)
          Either way.
          Jason continues to lift. Finally:

                         JASON
          Did you know the thing's worth over
          a million dollars? What a fucking
          stupid way to spend money.

                         ALEX

          The bar wobbles with Jason's laugh.. Alex moves behind and
          spots him, unnecessarily.

                         ALEX
          Don't screw around with me, Jason.
          He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason
          shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and
          re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face,
          his expression hidden.

                         JASON
          I don't know where it is anymore.
          You killed the only person who did.

                         ALEX
          It was an accident! What did I have
          to do with it?
          Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.

                         JASON
          There was a car following us!

                         ALEX
          Did you see who was in it?
          Jason shakes his head no.

                         ALEX
          I met one of these guys. Tall,
          weird-looking fucker with.a gray
          crew-cut.
          (letting out a breath)
          These people you don't steal from.
          Whoever was following Suzanne is
          going to come after you, too.
          Haven't you figured that out?
          For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible
          alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.

                         JASON
          Who are they?
          Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.

                         ALEX
          Doesn't matter. Give the necklace
          back to me, and we'll split the
          handling commission.
          His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust
          Alex. He shakes his head.

          She never told me where she kept it.
          Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a
          dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick
          it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.

          Victor is lying on his bed, the respirator beside him,
          while he talks on the phone to Alex. He looks dreadful.

                         VICTOR
          Nice boy like that, the money means
          diddlyshit. And, personally, I
          suspect he'd rather die than tell
          you. So get a blowtorch, and use it
          on the girl until he cooperates.

          .. Just as an example, Alex.

                         ALEX

          I think he's probably figured out

          chest. He no longer wants to make love.

          (into the phone)
          -- Come meet me, I gotta talk to
          you. I'm at the Haitian
          marketplace. You know where it is?

          GABRIELLA (V.0.)
          I can't just -- what am I going to
          tell him.

                         JASON
          An thing you want. Don't drive,
          take a cab --
          (as she laughs at what
          sounds like silliness)
          -- I'll wait for you.
          Jason hangs up. He looks around. He doesn't see Victor
          watching from the trinket stand.
          Be walks to the counter where he has already ordered
          coffee and pie. He picks up his fork. He can't eat.
          There's a folded newspaper left behind by another
          customer. He pulls it over.

          Gabriella walks through the stalls, looking for Jason and
          spies him at the counter. The paper is folded beside him.
          She sits down next to him.

                         GABRIELLA
          Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do
          you know how much a cab costs?

                         JASON

           She starts to swivel off the stool to leave. He grabs her
          hand.

                          (HARDER)
          -- Hey!

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm so sick of this. You'd say
          anything!
          He hands her the newspaper.

                         GABRIELLA

                         WHAT --

                         JASON
          Read it.

          198 INSERT: THE HEADLINE 198
          at the bottom of the page reads, "Duchess of Windsor
          Jewels/Stolen From Socialite," with a picture of the
          Duchess herself in her glory days, necklace around her
          throat.

                         GABRIELLA
          reads the headline and starts to laugh.

                         GABRIELLA
          There is such a thing as justicel
          Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to
          a better person.

                         JASON

                         JASON
          The reason I know is because I stole
          it from him.
          Her eyes widen.

                         VICTOR
          his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure
          out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella.
          He can read their faces, but not their lips.

          JASON AND GABRIELLA

                         GABRIELLA
          ... The sonofabitch. That's why he
          went out with me. He was trying to
          use me!
          (the thought hits her)
          They'll think I'm part of it! The
          maid who got fired??

                         JASON
          You weren't a maid.

                         JASON

          following his mother.

                         JASON
          accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.

          203 INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING) 203

          Victor makes a face; he thinks he has been spotted. Jason
          is getting harder to follow. The music ends; An
          ANNOUNCER describes what it was, gives the time. There's
          a BEEP. The NEWS THEME starts up. "On the hour every
          hour, we give you all the news you need..." The announcer
          continues with the lead stories, including the recently-

          The shutters have been closed, Alex is lying on the couch
          in the dark, having a nap. He's awakened by a nasty
          wheeze. Victor is standing over him.

                         ALEX
          A man with your breeding usually

          You heard the news.
          Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as
          though to admire it.

                         VICTOR
          I know you keep money here
          somewhere.

                         (A BEAT)
          Your stash. Give it to me.
          Alex spreads out his hands.

                         AALEX
          Vic, Vic --
          The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries
          out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.

                         VICTOR
          The. cops are about to drive up your
          street.
          He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.

                         ALEX
          (through teeth clenched

                         WITH PAIN)
          There's nothing here to.give you.

                         VICTOR
          Where is it?
          He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away.
          The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His
          cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.

                         ALEX "
          Believe me -- I swear to God, I

                         DON'T --
          Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it
          down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He
          has to push the words out through aâ€¢coughing spasm.

                         VICTOR
          I refuse to die in a fucking prison
          clinic!
          Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for
          breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses
          it on the floor.

                         (CONTINUED)

          He puts his arm around victor's waist and helps him to the
          sofa.

                         ALEX
          Come on, this is pitiful.
          Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his
          throat and desperately draws in air.

                         ALEX
          What a mess.
          He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor
          gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down
          over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex
          has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple
          making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor.
          Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances.
          He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no
          possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's
          dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady
          hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours
          a glass.

                         ALEX

                         (QUIETLY)
          At least you got to die in your own

          A few Truckers make remarks as Gabriella walks toward the
          bank of phones. "Hey, pretty lady." "Possibility?"
          "She's not your type." She doesn't mind swinging her hips
          a little for their benefit.

          it over to the cops. You know
          what'll happen to me.

          Jason comes out of the men's room. He doesn't see
          Gabriella for a moment. A couple of truckers block his
          view. Now he catches sight of her. She's coming from the
          direction of the phones, a can of soda in her hand. Their
          eyes meet. She smiles and waves the can, hurries to meet
          h1m.

           The motorcycle cruises up the coast road. The surf glows

          On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY
          dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS
          BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off
          the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice
          Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click
          off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the
          slips.

          214 INT. BOAT - DAY 214

          Jason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He
          slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's
          arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin
          hatch.

                         HIS POV
          Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as
          Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his
          lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a
          donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.

                         ALEX
          Good morning! I brought donuts.
          Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the
          boat, his arms around his ribs.

                         ALEX
          Oh, it's not as bad as all that.

                         JASON
          She fucking called you.

          Alex shrugs.

                         ALEX
          She has some residual loyalty, yeah.

                         (MODESTLY)
          Which I didn't expect either.
          Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex
          quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.

                         ALEX
          Where are we going?

                         JASON
          I'm going fishing. Get off if you
          want.

                         ALEX
          No, it's a beautiful day for a boat
          ride. Give us a chance to talk.
          He makes himself comfortable.

                         JASON
          Then make yourself useful and cast
          off the stern line.
          Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow
          line.

                         ALEX
          This one?

                         JASON
          There's not a lot of choice.
          Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He
          sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies
          store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.

                         ALEX
          -- If we could manage to ignore the
          personal history here, I think we
          could work something out between us.
          Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.

                         ALEX
          You want Gabriella? This is the way
          to have her. Life costs, Jason.
          Love costs. And you love her more
          than I do.

          (as Jason glances at

                         HIM)
          So stake yourself to a life
          together. Give her what she needs --

                         (SEEING GABRIELLA
          before Jason does)
          -- Hi, honey.
          Gabriella comes up onto deck. She glances bewildered at
          the ocean around them.

                         GABRIELLA
          Why are we --

                         JASON
          -- Shut up! Just shut up!
          She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.

                         ALEX
          He's feeling like you let him down.
          .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for
          another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL
          hitting the waves substitute for conversation.

          215 EXT. BOAT - DAY (LATER) -215

          Jason finishes setting the lines.

                         JASON
          -- Okay. I'm ready to listen.
          He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,
          who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.

                         JASON

                         (TO GABRIELLA)
          Alex wants to make me an offer.
          She gives no sign of having heard him.

                         ALEX
          We're giving you a hard choice,
          Gabby. Two rich men.
          Gabriella swivels her head slowly.

                         GABRIELLA
          I don't want either one of you.
          A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.

           Something's going to bite, just

                          ABOUT --
           (his biceps tightening)
           -- now.
          And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line
          reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it.
          Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in
          a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.
          He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to
          the surface a big, dark green fish. _

                         ALEX
          Jesus! What the hell is that?

                         JASON
          Hammerhead. Young. Male.
          Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and
          thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.

                         GABRIELLA
          Help him, Alex.

                         ALEX
          I'd just get in his way.
          His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
          reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his
          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast
          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He
          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it
          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving
          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared
          without either of them noticing.

          216 INT. CABIN - DAY 216

          Alex is searching frantically.

          JASON (O.S.)
          No luck?
          Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand.
          Jason retreats a step.

                         JASON
          Is this your backup plan?

                         JASON
          You want it so bad, it's yours.
          He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.

                         ALEX

                         (MOANING)
          You little prick.

          217 INT./EXT. CABIN - THE NECKLACE

          skitters along the deck. The shark's body stops it from
          dropping out the open gate in the transom.

                         ALEX
          scrambles toward the necklace.

                         GABRIELLA
          Don't let him have it! He'll kill

                         USL
          Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her
          from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled,
          warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws
          snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He
          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark
          continues to tear at him.

                         ALEX
          Help me, help.mel!
          Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates
          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.
          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.

                         ALEX
          You knew it wasn't dead.
          Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.

                         JASON
          Mom didn't take the necklace.
          did.

          Alex struggles to stay conscious.

                         ALEX
          Then you killed her yourself.
          Jason slowly nods.

                         JASON
          And you were in the car behind us.
          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
          slightly.

                         GABRIELLA
          We were supposed to turn him ini I
          didn't think you were going to kill
          him!

                         JASON
          Well, I didn't.
          Alex manages to laugh.

                         ALEX
          Jesus. You set me up. You had her
          call me.

                         (TO GABRIELLA)
          Shit... I believed you.
          Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.

                         JASON
          I'll get on the radio.
          Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
          left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She
          looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.
          They look at each other.

                         JASON
          has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.
          Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare
          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
          the radio.

                         JASON
          This is Hercules II, calling the
          Harbormaster...

          219 EXT. DOCK - DAY

          At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to
          hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off
          the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly
          heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them
          off.

                         CLOSER ANGLE

                         HENRY
          You cool?

                         JASON
          I will be.

                         HENRY
          See ya.
          He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is
          left with Alex.

                         ALEX
          (weakly; to Henry)
          What's your name?

                         HENRY
          No way --

                         ALEX
          (still the salesman)
          -- No, listen, listen -- this is
          worth a fortune.
          (thrusting the necklace

                         TOWARD HIM)
          Play the possibilities.

                         HENRY
          Yeah. Good advice.
          And he walks away fast.

                         ALEX
          Wait, don't go! Come back here.
          Come on back!

          Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
          give up hope in a hopeless situation.
