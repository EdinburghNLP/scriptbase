Alex Gates (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy wine merchant who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason (Stephen Dorff) with his indifference.
Alex is heavily in debt, and cases the house of his clients, the Reese family.
After he steals a valuable diamond necklace with the help of his Cuban mistress Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez) and his safe-cracker partner Victor (Michael Caine), things start to fall apart fast.

Suzanne sets out to interrupt what she thinks is another one of Alex's weekend dalliances down in the Florida Keys, but his trip is really to pawn the jewels.
Trouble escalates when she discovers the truth and gets involved.
