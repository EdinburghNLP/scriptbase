A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated , garbled video .
He 's OUT OF BREATH .
Crates are visible behind him .
We 're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room .
This is Agent Leland Turbo .
I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile .
SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK : WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS
Finn .
My cover 's been compromised .
Everything 's gone pear-shaped .
SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK : A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM
You wo n't believe what I 've found out here .
He angles our camera view , reveals a PORTHOLE through which we can see flames rising in the distance .
This is bigger than anything we 've ever seen .
And no one even knows it exists .
Finn , I need backup .
But do n't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation .
And be careful .
It 's not safe out here !
ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go .
Transmitting my grids now .
Good luck !
Coordinates appear : 40 6.80 ' N - 172 23.84 ' W TITLE CARD : CARS 2
A TINY CRAB BOAT -LRB- CRABBY -RRB- crests over massive swells .
Alright buddy , we 're here .
Right where you paid me to bring you .
Question is , why ?
A metallic blue sports car , circa the ` 60s , emerges from the shadows .
Cagey , smooth , he 'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world .
Meet FINN MCMISSILE .
I 'm looking for a car .
A car ?
Hey pal , you ca n't get any further away from land than out here .
Exactly where I want to be .
Well I got news for you , buddy .
There 's nobody out here but us .
Suddenly , a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP , the size of most cruise ships .
FINN quickly backs into the shadows , out of sight .
What are you doing out here ?
What does it look like , genius ?
I 'm crabbing !
Well turn around and go back where you came from .
Yeah ?
And who 's gon na make me ?
A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes .
Alright , alright !
Do n't get your prop in a twist .
-LRB- as he turns to leave . -RRB-
What a jerk .
Sorry , buddy .
Looks like it 's the end of the line .
Buddy ?
ON CRABBY 'S DECK : Finn is gone .
FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP , clandestine .
We 're with Finn as the ship continues on , cuts through the darkness with purpose .
Suddenly small flames appear , perhaps a knot or so away .
Then WHOOSH !
A flame rises above Finn , the ship .
It illuminates an OIL DERRICK .
THWAP !
Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it .
He 's going to SLAM into the side with brute force WHEN ----- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton .
He STICKS to the derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP .
From this vantage point , hundreds of derricks appear .
Finn approaches a loading bay from above , hides .
He watches as GREMLINS , PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Leland Turbo , this is Finn McMissile .
I 'm at the rally point .
Over .
No response .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Leland , it 's Finn .
Please respond .
Over .
AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below .
A boxy , monacle-wearing German car enters .
This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP .
-LRB- in German and English . -RRB-
Too many cars here .
Out of my way !
Professor Zundapp ?
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Here it is , Professor .
Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE .
You wanted to see this before we load it ?
Ah , yes .
Very carefully .
A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA , packed carefully in foam .
Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY .
Oh .
A TV camera .
What does it actually do ?
This camera is extremely dangerous .
-LRB- TO HIMSELF . -RRB-
What are you up to now , Professor ?
Finn , angling for a better view , FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ----- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ----- THOK !
They hook tightly onto a steel girder .
Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat , then expels another cross-wire for support .
This is valuable equipment .
Make sure it is properly secured for the voyage .
You got it .
Finn LOWERS HIMSELF .
He snaps more pictures .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Hey , Professor Z !
Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE .
GREM and ACER , an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer , flank it .
This is one of those British spies we told you about .
Yeah .
This one we caught sticking his bumper where it did n't belong .
Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side , readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland .
Agent Leland Turbo .
The crate is lifted , revealing a CRUSHED , CUBED Leland Turbo .
Finn 's eyes go wide .
Suddenly -- WHOOOSHHH !
Another derrick flame rises behind him , casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor .
He looks up .
It 's Finn McMissile !
He 's seen the camera !
Kill him !
Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat -- He BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from - BLOWTORCHES ready .
Finn , stuck in midair , notices an angry CRANE .
Finn GRINS , having just found his escape .
THWAPTHWAPTHWAP !
Finn releases three of his four cables , swinging , Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE CRANE ----- where he lands on its BOOM , drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck !
Finn now DRIVES , spraying oil and screeching around corners .
A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch , loses control ----- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig !
The Gremlin FALLS .
it 's like an eternity .
He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces .
ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars .
He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad .
He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS , fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps , sending barrels DOWN the ramp , PAST FINN ----- PAST the pursuing CARS ----- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP , taking out at least 15 CARS !
ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view , pulls to a stop .
No more road .
Nowhere else to go .
The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him , fire up their blowtorches .
About to pounce .
Finn GRINS .
The second time we 've seen this grin .
It means he 's got something cooking .
Finn 's REVERSE LIGHTS appear .
He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars .
Finn falls .
He turns himself so he 's grill first , cleanly cutting into the water .
He EMERGES , now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away .
-LRB- NONPLUSSED . -RRB-
Get to the boats .
THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn , FIRING BULLETS as they do so .
He 's getting away !
Not for long .
The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water .
It skips along , connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds .
UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS .
Then , he blinks .
He GRINS .
We 're starting to like this grin and what follows it .
He now CONVERTS into a submarine .
From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts .
ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
He 's dead , Professor .
Wunderbar .
With Finn McMissile gone , who can stop us now ?
TOW MATER , a rusty tow truck , putters into view .
Mater .
Tow Mater , that 's who .
is here to help you !
He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road .
He drives around to the front , catching OTIS ' face for the first time .
Hey , Otis !
Hey , Mater .
Gosh , I 'm so sorry .
I thought I could make it this time , but .
-LRB- he tries to start his engine , stalls . -RRB-
Smooth like pudding , huh ?
Ah , who am I kidding ?
I 'll always be a lemon .
Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him .
Well dadgum , you 're leaking oil again .
Must be your gaskets .
Hey , look on the bright side : This is your tenth tow this month , so that means it 's on the house .
You 're the only one that 's nice to lemons like me , Mater .
Do n't sweat it .
These things happen to everybody , Otis .
But you never leak oil .
Yeah , but I ai n't perfect .
Do n't tell nobody , but I think my rust is starting to show through .
Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN .
It has been amended to say : `` Home of Lightning McQueen . ''
Hey , is Lightning McQueen back yet ?
Not yet .
He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup .
Four !
Wow !
Yeah , we 're so dadgum proud of him .
But I sure wish he 'd hurry up and get back ` cause we got a whole summer 's worth of best friend fun to make up for .
Just me and -
Ahead of them , a half-mile off , a RED RACE CAR is visible .
-- McQueen !
Mater FLOORS IT , dragging poor Otis behind him .
Uh , Mater ?
I 'm in no hurry .
You do n't need to go so fast !
Boom !
They hit a bump .
Otis catches air .
Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends .
Oh , Lightning .
Welcome home .
Good to have you back , honey .
Congratulations , man .
Welcome home , soldier .
The place was n't the same without you , son .
What ?
Did he go somewhere ?
It 's good to be home , everybody .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
McQueen !
They all turn around , see Mater speeding into town , with Otis swerving behind him .
Mater !
McQueen !
Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion , slingshots Otis forward --
Woaahhhhh !
-- right through Ramone 's front door --
-- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift .
Ramone lifts him up , routine .
Hey .
How far 'd you make it this time , Otis ?
Halfway to the county line .
Not bad , man .
I know , I ca n't believe it either !
McQueen , welcome back !
Mater , it 's so good to see you .
You too , buddy .
Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP -LRB- fist bump style -RRB- .
Oh , man .
You ai n't gon na believe the things I got planned for us .
Everyone watches as the tire bump continues .
-LRB- to Lizzie , an aside . -RRB-
These best friend greetings get longer every year .
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
You ready to have some serious fun ?
Well , actually I 've got something to show you first .
CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP .
It has now changed , been adorned with a small likeness of Doc .
It says `` Hudson Hornet Piston Cup . ''
Wow .
I ca n't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson .
McQueen and Mater are alone , the museum closed to the public .
McQueen approaches a `` Hudson Hornet '' wall with Doc 's three Piston cups , framed articles , other racing ephemera .
I know Doc said these things were just old cups , but to have someone else win it just did n't feel right , you know ?
Well , Doc would 've been real proud of you .
That 's for sure .
McQueen takes this in .
McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum .
Alright , pal .
I 've been waiting all summer for this .
What 've you got planned ?
You sure you can handle it ?
Come on , you know who you 're talking to ?
This is Lightning McQueen .
I can handle anything .
Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track , their tires off .
They 're on their rims .
Uh .
Mater ?!
Just remember , your brakes ai n't gon na work on these !
As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL --
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Mater !
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Relax , these train tracks ai n't been used in years !
From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN .
The two friends emerge , going as fast as they can on train tracks , uphill , with no tires .
Come on , come on !
Faster , faster !
Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears , oversized horn visible , cackling and laughing at his prank .
An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps .
McQueen and Mater sneak up .
This is gon na be good !
They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER , tractor-tipping style .
They LAUGH at the gag , but soon realize the earth mover 's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them .
Uh-oh .
This ai n't gon na be good .
The exhaust pipe BELCHES .
McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out of view .
The sun sets .
McQueen and Mater roll into town .
McQueen looks exhausted .
Mater is still full of energy .
Boy , this was the best day ever !
And my favorite souvenir ?
Mater proudly shows off a dent .
This new dent !
Boy , Mater .
Today was , uh .
Shoot , that was nothing .
Wait til you see what I got planned for tonight .
Mater , Mater .
Whoa .
I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner .
That 's exactly what I was thinking .
No , I .
I meant with Sally , Mater .
Even better !
You , me and Miss Sally going out for supper .
McQueen pulls around in front of Mater , stops .
Mater , I meant it would be just me and Sally .
Oh .
It 's just for tonight .
We 'll do whatever you want tomorrow .
-LRB- DISAPPOINTED . -RRB-
Okay .
Thanks for understanding .
Yeah , sure .
Y' all go on and have fun now .
Alright , then .
See ya soon , amigo !
McQueen drives off .
Mater watches him go .
It 's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant , with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside .
MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator Springs and the starry night sky .
This is so nice .
I ca n't tell you how good it is to be here alone .
Just the two of us .
Finally , you and me --
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Good evening .
Mater is at their table , dressed as a waiter .
My name is Mater and I 'll be your waiter .
-LRB- TO HIMSELF . -RRB-
Mater the waiter .
That 's funny right there .
Mater , you work here ?
Well yeah I work here .
What 'd you think , I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter , just so I could hang out with you ?
McQueen and Sally exchange a look .
Oh , yeah .
How ridiculous would that be ?
Now , can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks ?
Yes .
I 'll have my usual .
You know what ?
I 'm going to have that too .
Mater blinks .
Uh , right .
Your usual .
INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes drinks , ala `` Cocktail . ''
Mater arrives .
Guido !
What 's McQueen 's usual ?
-LRB- in Italian , subtitled . -RRB-
How should I know ?
Perfect !
Give me two of ` em .
Quiet !
My program 's on .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Tonight on `` The Mel Dorado Show '' !
ON THE BAR TV - `` THE MEL DORADO SHOW , '' a cable talk show , begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD , a sleek SUV .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
His story gripped the world !
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod , in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS , ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild !
We see images of newspaper headlines , search crews .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Feared dead , he emerged 36 days later , running on a fuel he 'd distilled himself from the natural elements !
Since then he 's sold his oil fortune , converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car , and has devoted his life to finding a renewable , clean-burning fuel !
Images of oil derricks torn down ; Miles Axlerod getting converted to electric ; lab scientists testing chemicals .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol .
Images of fields , rivers , vegetables , and mountains all combining to form the Allinol logo .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
And to show the world what his new superfuel can do , he 's created a racing competition like no other , inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix .
Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod .
SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives , parks across from Mel 's desk .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Thank you , Mel .
It is very good to be here .
Now listen to me : Big Oil .
It costs a fortune .
Pollution is getting worse .
I mean , come on .
It 's a fossil fuel .
Fossil .
As in dead dinosaurs .
And we all know what happened to them .
Alternative energy is the future .
Trust me , Mel , after seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix , nobody will ever go back to gasoline again .
-LRB- TO FILLMORE . -RRB-
What happened to the dinosaurs , now ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
And on satellite , a World Grand Prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world , Francesco Bernoulli .
Across the screen : LIVE FROM ROME , ITALY .
We meet Formula race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
It is an honor , Signore Dorado .
For you .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Miles , why not invite Lightning McQueen ?
Mater , collecting his drinks , looks up , half-intrigued .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Of course we invited him .
But apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco !
Mater does n't like this .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour !
In miles that is like , uh .
way faster than McQueen .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Let 's go to the phones .
Baltimore , Maryland , you 're on the air .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Am I on ?
Hello ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
You 're on .
Go ahead .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Hello ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Go ahead , caller .
Dial tone .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Let 's go to Radiator Springs .
You 're on , caller .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Yeah , that Italian feller you got on there ca n't talk that way about Lightning McQueen .
He 's the bestest race car in the whole wide world .
Fillmore and Sarge look around .
Mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone .
Uh-oh .
FRANCESCO -LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
If he is , how you say `` the bestest race car , '' then why must he rest , eh ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Cause he knows what 's important .
Every now and then he prefers just to slow down , enjoy life .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Ah , you heard it !
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow !
Of course , this is not news to Francesco .
When I want to go to sleep I watch one of his races .
After two laps I am out cold .
Audible RXNS from the bar .
A crowd has been forming ever since Mater started talking .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
That ai n't what I meant .
MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside .
Hey , what 's going on over there ?
THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd , see that they 're watching Francesco on the television .
-LRB- TO SALLY . -RRB-
Oh , it 's that Italian Formula car .
His name is --
Francesco Bernoulli .
No wonder there 's a crowd .
When Sally says his name , she enunciates each part , as if Italian were her mother 's tongue .
Wait , why do you know his name ?
And do n't say it like that .
It 's three syllables , not ten .
What ?
He 's nice to look at .
You know , open-wheeled and all .
What 's wrong with fenders ?
I thought you like my fenders .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Well let me tell you something else there , Mr. San Francisco --
Mater ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
McQueen could drive circles around you .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Driving in circles is all he can do , no ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
No !
I mean yes .
I mean he could beat you anywhere , anytime , any track .
On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ----- Mater , turned away from the crowd , still on the phone .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Mel , can we move on ?
Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation .
Like a dump truck .
ON MCQUEEN .
He does n't like this at all .
Ha ha !
That shows what you know .
Dump trucks is dumb .
Suddenly , Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by McQueen .
-LRB- INTO PHONE . -RRB-
Yeah , hi , this is Lightning McQueen .
Look , I do n't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
McQueen !
That was your best friend ?
This is the difference between you and Francesco .
Francesco knows how good he is .
He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it .
Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Fragilé !
?
He calls Francesco fragilé ?
Not so fast , McQueen !
`` Not so fast . ''
What is that , your new motto ?
Francesco goes ballistic in Italian .
They cut his mic .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Well , this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course .
What do you say , Lightning McQueen ?
We 've still got room for one more racer .
Well , I would love to .
The only thing is my crew 's off for the season so --
A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore , Sarge and Luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar .
Ramone backs away , having spray painted `` TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN '' on it .
Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles .
Pit stop .
McQueen turns back to the phone .
You know what ?
They just got back .
Deal me in , baby .
Ka-chow !
The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS .
MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone booth where Sally waits .
Off her look :
I know , I know .
I just got back .
But we wo n't be long and --
Oh , no , do n't worry about me .
I 've got enough to do here .
Mater 's going to have a blast though .
-LRB- off McQueen 's silence . -RRB-
You 're bringing Mater , right ?
You never bring him to any of your races .
McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their drinks , hates it , spits it back in the glass .
Just let him sit in the pits , give him a headset .
C'mon , it 'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him .
Mater arrives .
Your drinks , sir .
Mater .
I did n't taste it !
How 'd you like to come and see the world with me ?
You mean it ?
You got me into this thing .
You 're coming along .
- McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone .
Mater , now sporting a `` Team McQueen '' emblem , seems psyched as well .
- An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight : Tokyo , Japan .
- Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen , Guido , Luigi , Fillmore and Sarge as ----- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane .
Red bawls .
- IN THE JET , LATER .
McQueen and Mater are the only ones awake , watch an insane Japanese game show .
- JAPAN AT NIGHT .
A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon , glamour , scrolling billboards , vending machines and high-tech skyscrapers .
- INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys : Mater and McQueen enter .
A tourist sees McQueen and faints .
- A KABUKI THEATER .
Team McQueen watches a methodical dance .
Mater , dressed in Kabuki makeup , arrives .
He looks insane .
- A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a parking space .
Mater , now in his element , cheers .
The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO --
-- TEAM MCQUEEN , as they roll up the red carpet .
Press is held at bay behind ropes .
WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos are strategically placed for maximum press exposure .
RACERS are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes .
Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum .
As they roll down a ramp to the party , they are awed .
Guido , look !
Ferraris and tires !
Let 's go !
-LRB- IMPRESSED . -RRB-
Hey , look at this .
Okay now Mater , remember : best behavior .
You got it , buddy .
Hey , what 's that ?
He sees something , peels away .
Mater !
Hey , McQueen , over here !
It 's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON .
McQueen now has no choice but to let Mater go .
Hey , Jeff .
Lewis !
MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a pitty RAKES rocks with precision .
He knocks on the glass with his hook .
Hey !
You done good !
You got all the leaves !
People turn at the noise he 's making .
MCQUEEN , JEFF and LEWIS .
Check out that tow truck .
I wonder who that guy 's with ?
Will you guys excuse me just for one little second ?
He zips over to Mater 's side , quickly pulls him out of sight .
Mater , listen .
This is n't Radiator Springs .
You 're just realizing that ?
Boy , that jet-lag really done a number on you .
Mater , look -- things are different over here .
Which means maybe you should , you know , act a little different too .
Different than what ?
Well , just .
help me out here , buddy .
I --
You need help ?
Shoot , why did n't you just say so ?
That 's what a tow truck does .
Hey , looky there , it 's Mr. San Francisco !
FRANCESCO is visible across the room , holding court .
I 'll introduce you .
Mater , no .
-LRB- already on his way . -RRB-
Look at me -- I 'm helping you already !
On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER .
Mater approaches , giddy .
Hey Mr. San Francisco , I 'd like you to meet --
Lightning McQueen !
Buona sera .
Nice to meet you , Francesco .
Yeah , nice to meet you too .
You are very good-looking .
Not as good as I thought , but you 're good .
-LRB- TO FRANCESCO . -RRB-
Excuse me .
Can I get a picture with you ?
Anything for McQueen 's friend .
As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco :
Miss Sally is gon na flip when she sees this .
She 's Lightning McQueen 's girlfriend .
Oooh .
She 's a big fan of yours .
Hey , she has good taste .
Mater 's prone to exaggeration .
I would n't say she 's a `` big '' fan .
You 're right .
She 's a huge fan .
She goes on and on about your open wheels here .
Mentioning it once does n't qualify as going `` on and on . ''
Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco .
Women respect a car that has nothing to hide .
Yeah , uh .
Let us have a toast .
McQueen does n't like where this is going , covers .
Let 's .
-LRB- raising a drink . -RRB-
I dedicate my win tomorrow .
to Miss Sally .
Oh , sorry .
I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her .
So if we both do it , it 's really not so special .
Besides , I do n't have a drink .
I 'll go get you one .
You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks ?
-LRB- could kill him . -RRB-
They 're free , Mater .
Free ?
Well , shoot , what am I doing here ?
Mater ZIPS OFF .
I should probably go keep an eye on him .
See you at the race .
McQueen starts to leave .
Yes , you will see Francesco .
But not like this .
Francesco does a 180 , so his rear end now faces McQueen .
You will see him like this , as he drives away from you .
Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says `` Ciao , McQueen ! ''
That 's cute .
So you had one of those made up for all the racers ?
No .
Okay .
He rolls off .
He is so getting beat tomorrow .
Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed .
Ladies and gentlecars .
Sir Miles Axlerod !
MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain , appears .
It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first-ever World Grand Prix .
From Brazil .
Number eight .
ON FINN MCMISSILE .
He appears from the shadows , keeps a careful distance from the stage .
He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ----- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll , catching Miles Axlerod 's speech for publicity and posterity .
Finn 's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one , compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform .
Each one is `` NOT A MATCH . ''
His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL SPORTS CAR .
She approaches Finn .
Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL .
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator .
That 's because it 's air-cooled .
I 'm Agent Shiftwell , Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station .
I have a message from London .
Not here .
-LRB- LOUDLY . -RRB-
You must try the canapes on the mezzanine !
He moves her onto an elevator .
The doors close on them .
IN THE ELEVATOR , GOING UP .
So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent ?
What did they learn about the camera ?
It appears to be a standard television camera .
They said if you could get closer photos next time , that would be great .
This was London 's message ?
Oh -- no , no .
No sir .
Um , the oil platforms you were on ?
Turns out they 're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world .
How did we miss that ?
They 'd been scrambling everyone 's satellites .
The Americans actually discovered it just before you did .
They placed an agent on that platform , under deep cover .
He was able to get a photo of the car who 's running the entire operation .
The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine .
Who is it ?
Has anyone seen the photo yet ?
No , not yet .
The American is here tonight to pass it to you .
He 'll signal you when he 's ready .
GOOD --
Finn suddenly STOPS COLD .
Oh no .
Professor Zundapp is visible below them .
He talks with a few Pacers and Gremlins .
Finn quickly retreats into the shadows .
Holley follows suit .
What is it ?
Change of plan .
You 're meeting the American .
What , me ?
Those thugs down there were on the oil platform .
If they see me , the whole mission is compromised .
No , no .
I 'm technical , you see .
I 'm in Diagnostics .
I 'm not a field agent .
You are now .
MATER as he grabs a drink , keeps moving .
I 'll take one of them .
He snatches it , drops it in the back where we now see a large assortment of drinks balanced .
Never know which one McQueen 'll have a hankering for .
He approaches a sushi bar .
Hey , what you got here that 's free ?
How about that pistachio ice cream ?
He refers to wasabi , of course .
No , no .
Wasabi .
Oh , same ol' , same ol' .
What 's up with you ?
That looks delicious .
The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater .
Uh , a little more , please .
It is free , right ?
-LRB- the chef adds more . -RRB-
Keep it coming .
A little more .
Come on , let 's go , it 's free !
You 're getting there .
Scoop scoop !
The chef gives in .
Scoops a baseball-sized ball out .
There you go .
Now THAT 's a scoop of ice cream .
-LRB- in Japanese , subtitles . -RRB-
My condolences .
MILES AXLEROD - He 's now nearly done with his intros .
and now , our last competitor -- Number 95 , Lightning McQueen !
MCQUEEN approaches the microphone , flashes his headlights .
Thank you so much for having us , Sir Axlerod .
I really look forward to racing .
This is a great opportunity .
Oh , the pleasure is all ours , Lightning .
You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition .
As if on cue , Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain .
Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage , making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN .
Somebody get me water !
He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat .
-LRB- LAPPING WATER . -RRB-
Sweet relief .
Miles Axlerod is shocked .
The crowd ca n't believe it .
Francesco cackles .
Mater , now sated , approaches the mic .
-LRB- to the crowd . -RRB-
Whatever you do , do not eat the free pistachio ice cream .
It has turned !
Sir Axlerod , I can explain .
This is Mater .
I know him .
This is the bloke that called into the television show .
-LRB- TO MATER . -RRB-
You 're the one I have to thank .
No , thank you .
This trip 's been amazing .
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
He 's a little excited , is n't he ?
TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater .
Mater !
But wait , I .
oh , shoot .
McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside , out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others .
McQueen is beside himself .
Mater , you have to get a hold of yourself .
You 're making a scene .
But I never leak oil .
Never .
Go take care of yourself right now .
Mater drives off .
ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER He drives through the party , frantic .
Coming through !
Excuse me , leakin ' oil .
Where 's the bathroom ?
Thank you .
I got ta go !
Someone points Mater down a hallway .
He whips around the CORNER ----- and STOPS .
Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS , neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE .
-LRB- CONFUSED . -RRB-
What the .
Mater chooses one , drives inside .
A SHRIEK is heard and Mater zips out .
Sorry ladies !
He heads into the other door --
Mater rolls in , still ` holding it in ' like a kid .
I never leak I never leak I never leak .
He sees someone leaving a stall .
He heads in .
IN THE STALL - Mater enters , looks up .
Wowee .
The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights .
High-tech Japanese .
It suddenly GRABS MATER , hoists him up as if he 's going to get an oil change .
What in the --
A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR , followed by images of waterfalls and rivers .
-LRB- GIGGLING . -RRB-
Hey , that tickles .
The caricature starts talking in Japanese .
Suddenly WATER FIRES UP underneath Mater 's undercarriage , goosing him .
He freaks out .
OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater 's yells audible we see a GREMLIN enter , furtive .
Suddenly , inexplicably , his frame BREAKS APART like an egg , revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR underneath .
The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him , clearly his disguise .
This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent .
Okay , McMissile .
I 'm here .
It 's time for the drop .
HOLLEY , rolls along by herself .
Nervous .
DING !
Her rearview monitor springs to life .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
The American has activated his tracking beacon .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Roger that .
Move in .
Rod Redline , waiting at a sink , feels a presence behind him .
GREM and ACER have entered , hesitate briefly when they see Rod Redline .
Rod Redline , careful , slides a gun out of his tire .
He is suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs -- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST .
A TIGHT , CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHT begins -- IN THE STALL - Mater , still TRAPPED , is now being SCRUBBED as if in a car wash .
He is helpless .
OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized .
Just when he scrambles away from one car , the other one takes over .
IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released , but when he backs out ----- Rod Redline is THROWN INTO MATER 'S STALL DOOR , crunching it and sending Mater ----- BACK INTO THE CLUTCHES of the insane toilet .
Holley isolates the tracking beacon 's location in the party .
Oh , you 've got to be joking .
What 's the problem , Shiftwell ?
He 's in the loo .
So go in !
I ca n't just go into the men 's loo .
Time is of the essence , Shiftwell .
Rod Redline is in bad shape .
He backs away , betrays a look of concern .
He 's in trouble here .
ACER burns rubber , ready to finish him off .
Just as he shifts into DRIVE ----- MATER 'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN , knocking ACER out .
Mater jumps out , face-to-face GREM .
-LRB- out of breath . -RRB-
Whatever you do , I would not go in there .
The door SWINGS shut , revealing the pulverized Acer .
A Gremlin and a Pacer !
Rod Redline , now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity here , quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE .
-LRB- to Grem and Acer . -RRB-
No offense to your makes and models , but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the --
Rod Redline , surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater 's undercarriage .
-LRB- as he 's goosed . -RRB-
-- altar !
He spins around , sees Rod Redline for the first time .
Are you okay ?
I 'm fine .
Hey .
Tow truck .
Mater turns back to Grem and Acer .
We 'd like to get to our private business here , if you do n't mind .
Oh , yeah .
Do n't let me get in the way of your `` private business . ''
Oh !
A little advice : When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall , you best press that green button .
Thank you .
It 's to adjust the temperature .
Got it .
Remember it 's in Celsius , not Fahrenheit .
Get outta here !
Alright then .
Mater exits , leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem and Acer .
Holley arrives at the door .
She takes a breath , is about to enter when Mater EXITS .
Excuse me , ma'am .
He passes her , expelling some exhaust in the process .
Holley 's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on him .
-LRB- TO HIMSELF . -RRB-
Dadgum pistachio ice cream .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
This can not be him .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Is he American ?
-LRB- driving off , to himself . -RRB-
Look out , ladies .
Mater 's fittin ' to get funky !
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Extremely .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Then it 's him .
It 's settled .
Holley takes one more nervous breath , quickly closes the distance between her and Mater , cuts him off .
He is forced to STOP .
Hello .
Well , hello .
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator .
Well of course it does n't .
That 's ` cause it 's air-cooled !
-LRB- RELIEVED . -RRB-
Perfect .
I 'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE --
Course , Karmann Ghia 's were n't the only ones .
Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks , with the pancake motors .
Yeah .
Okay , I get it --
And before both of them , there 's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore 's one of them .
Listen !
We should find somewhere more private .
Uh , gee .
Do n't you think that 's a little , uh --
-LRB- NERVOUS ENERGY . -RRB-
You 're right .
Impossible to know which areas here are compromised .
So , when can I see you again ?
Well , let 's see .
Tomorrow I 'll be out there at the races .
Got it .
We 'll rendezvous then .
Mater returns to his team , lost in thought .
There you are .
Where have you been ?
What 's a rendezvous ?
It 's like a date .
A date ?!
Mater , what 's going on ?
Well , what 's going on is I 've got me a date tomorrow .
Guido makes a crack in Italian .
Guido do n't believe you .
Well , believe it .
My new girlfriend just said so .
Hey , there she is .
Mater points out Holley , who 's within earshot .
-LRB- YELLING . -RRB-
Hey !
Hey lady !
Holley , caught in plain view , DRIVES OFF .
See ya tomorrow !
Guido makes another crack in Italian .
Guido still do n't believe you .
An industrial dock , outside of the city proper .
Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet .
He 's been beaten up , clings to consciousness .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
I got ta admit --
Grem , Acer , and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers .
-- you tricked us real good .
And we do n't like being tricked .
Rod Redline laughs to himself .
Hey , what 's so funny ?
Well , you know , I was just wearing a disguise .
You guys are stuck looking like that .
This does n't help him .
They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL , lock him down .
A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied with Allinol brand gasoline .
Allinol ?
Thanks , fellas .
I hear this stuff is good for you .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
So you think .
The Professor emerges from the darkness , behind Rod .
Allinol by itself is good for you .
Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod 's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed .
But after microscopic examination , I have found that it has one small weakness .
When hit with an electromagnetic pulse , it becomes extremely dangerous .
SMILE --
Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that was in the box back at the oil derrick .
He points it at Rod Redline .
-- for the camera .
Is that all you want ?
I got a whole act .
You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform .
Now you will witness what it really does .
Whatever you say , Professor .
Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod .
On it , surveillance footage from the party .
Clearly , they were watching and recording him there .
You talked up a lot of cars last night .
Which one 's your associate ?
Your mother .
Oh no , I 'm sorry .
It was your sister .
You know , I ca n't tell them apart these days .
-LRB- HAD ENOUGH . -RRB-
Could I start it now , Professor ?
Fifty percent power .
-LRB- to Rod Redline . -RRB-
This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter .
-LRB- re : a girl on the TV . -RRB-
What about her ?
Did you give it to her ?
The Allinol is now heating to a boil , dramatically expanding , causing the engine block to crack under the stress , forcing oil into the combustion chamber .
Rod Redline 's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK .
-LRB- re : a guy on the TV . -RRB-
How about him ?
You talk to him ?
-LRB- to Professor Zundapp . -RRB-
What do I care ?
I can replace an engine block .
You may be able to , but after full impact of the pulse , unfortunately , there will be nothing to replace .
How about him ?
Does he have it ?
The monitor reveals MATER , rolling out of the bathroom and down the hall .
Rod Redline , seeing this , does the world 's most subtle double take .
We caught it , but there 's no way anyone else in the room could have --
That 's him .
He 's the one .
Roger that , Professor Z.
No !
As Grem turns up the machine even MORE , the Professor makes a call .
-LRB- INTO PHONE . -RRB-
Yes sir .
We believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information .
-LRB- beat , listening . -RRB-
I will take care of it before any damage can be done .
The Professor hangs up , turns to the room .
The project is still on schedule .
You will find this second agent --
Zundapp kicks the camera 's power into the RED .
-- and kill him .
On the MONITOR - With Mater 's frozen image on the screen we see Rod EXPLODE in the reflection .
Over television pre-roll of Japan :
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Japan .
Land of the rising sun .
Where ancient tradition meets modern technology .
Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix .
ON OUR ANNOUNCERS as they introduce themselves :
I 'm Brent Mustangburger , here with racing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap .
There 's never been a competition like this before .
SHOTS OF THE PITS as the racers fuel up .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
First , Allinol , making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions .
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- V.O. ; CONT 'D . -RRB-
Second , the course itself , and it 's like nothing we 've ever seen .
David , how exactly does this competition work ?
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Well , Brent , all three of these street courses are classic roundthe-house racetracks .
OUTLINES OF THREE RACE COURSES are shown .
They 're labeled Japan , Italy and England , and are different in shape and size .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
This means that the LMP and Formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion .
SHOTS OF THE RACERS as they weave up the track , practicing .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Look for Francesco Bernoulli in particular to lead early .
SHOTS OF Francesco , featured in an inset .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And with a series of technical turns throughout --
MORE SHOTS of the course , now highlighting the tech turns .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
GT and Touring cars like Spain 's Miguel Camino should make up some ground but I doubt it 'll be enough to stop Francesco from absolutely running away with it .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Woah , now just hold your horsepower .
You 're forgetting the most important factor here .
That early dirt track section of the course !
The dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race .
GRAPHICS OF THE COURSES now isolate a stretch after the first couple turns , label it `` DIRT SECTIONS . ''
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
French Rally car Raoul ÇaRoule is counting on a big boost headed through there .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And do n't forget Lightning McQueen !
His mentor , the Hudson Hornet , was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time .
In my opinion , McQueen is the best all-around racer in this competition .
BACK IN THE STUDIO
Really , Darrell , I think you need to clean your windshield .
You 're clearly not seeing this for what it is : Francesco 's race to lose .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
It 's time to find out .
The racers are locking into the grid --
Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go .
Everyone 's bright eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of the grid .
He CLOSES his eyes .
-LRB- TO HIMSELF . -RRB-
Speed .
I am speed .
A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes .
Francesco is next to him on the grid .
Really ?
You are `` speed '' ?
Then Francesco is triple speed .
-LRB- closes his eyes . -RRB-
Francesco .
Is .
Triple speed .
Francesco likes this , McQueen .
It 's really getting him into the zone !
He is so getting beat today .
The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN .
The race begins .
Francesco quickly grabs the lead .
He 's pulling away within seconds .
ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers .
We end on Team McQueen .
No Crew Chief , just a solid looking team .
His suspension stats look good .
Tire pressure is excellent .
He 's got plenty of fuel .
And he 's awesome !
The same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY .
Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown office building , behind reflective glass .
Why is he in the pits ?
He 's so exposed .
It 's his cover .
One of the best I 've seen , too .
Look at the detail on that rust .
It must have cost him a fortune .
But why has n't he contacted us yet ?
There 's probably heat on him .
Be patient .
Right , of course .
He 'll signal us when he can .
And then we find out who 's behind all this .
ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up ground .
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors , sees them approaching the dirt section .
McQueen !
It 's time to make your move .
Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Ten four , Mater .
ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control .
He SLAMS to a halt , his tires getting no traction .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Francesco is brought to a screeching halt !
MCQUEEN skids into view , turning right to go left , passing Francesco , followed by other cars --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Lightning McQueen is the first to take advantage .
And just like that , folks , Francesco 's lead is left in the dust .
Nice call , Mater .
Keep it up !
McQueen now leads the pack , zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Who-hoo !
Man , McQueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby !
ON PAVED ROAD AGAIN - MOMENTS LATER The field of cars thunders into a tunnel .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Everyone 's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again .
Francesco crests the hill , in last place .
He bites down , determined , then CHASES .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt .
He 's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race .
VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow Bridge .
Bit by bit , Francesco ekes his way toward the front , toward Lightning McQueen as we CUT TO ----- A ROOFTOP , and a VIEW THROUGH THE WGP CAMERA LENS .
Grem and Acer are manning this one .
They focus it on the racers as they approach .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
It is time .
Roger that .
ON THE TRACK - A racer -LRB- Miguel Camino -RRB- suddenly PLUMES WITH SMOKE and skids out .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Oh !
Miguel Camino has blown an engine !
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Very unusual , Darrell .
He 's been so consistent all year .
Camino quickly pits , passing McQueen 's pit where Mater is visible .
ON GREM AND ACER , watching from above .
You got ta be kidding me .
What is it ?
It 's that tow truck from the bathroom .
The one from the bathroom ?
Yeah , the one the American Agent passed the device to .
What about him ?
What about him ?
He 's in the pits !
Not for long .
Acer exits , with purpose .
ON FINN AND HOLLEY , still in their office hideaway .
Holley 's onboard computer flashes an ALERT .
Hold on .
I think I 've got something .
What is it ?
The Pacer from the party last night .
She 's spotted Acer , moving swiftly forward .
Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks .
Yep .
His VIN numbers match .
Anyone with him ?
He wo n't be alone .
Conducting analysis on the target .
The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins are in the crowd .
He 's not the only one here .
Three .
five .
they 're everywhere .
And they 're all closing in on .
oh no .
We PAN OVER to see it 's MATER .
Finn ?
Finn , where are you ?
She turns .
He 's GONE , leaving only an open window .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Get him out of the pits now !
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT .
A car WHIPS BY O.S.
Wow !
Some of them fellers is really loud .
-LRB- OVER MATER 'S RADIO . -RRB-
Can you hear me ?
Over .
Uh , what ?
-LRB- OVER MATER 'S RADIO . -RRB-
Get out of the pit now .
Do you hear me ?
Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Hey , I know you .
You 're that girl from the party last night .
You wan na do our date right now ?
ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco , holds his slim lead , but barely .
Guys , a little too much chatter .
Let 's keep this line clear .
BOOM !
A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke , skids out of control .
ON GREM - laughing .
That was clearly his handiwork .
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT - SAME
-LRB- ON MATER 'S RADIO . -RRB-
There 's no time for messing about .
You 've got to get out of the pits .
Is there gon na be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race ?
ON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
You 're running out of time !
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
They 're coming , Shiftwell .
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Yes , I know .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Get him out of there .
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
I 'm trying .
-LRB- TO MATER . -RRB-
Get out now !
We CUT BACK TO ----- MATER .
He gives in , exits the pit .
Well , all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend .
He moves toward the back PIT DOOR , is about to open it .
OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen 's pit door on the other side .
Ready to pounce .
The doors OPEN , REVEALING ----- Finn , holding a fire extinguisher .
Finn McMissile ?
But you 're dead !
Then this should n't hurt at all .
He empties the extinguisher in their eyes , speeds past .
They try and follow , but have been blinded .
One of them crashes right into a COP .
ON FINN - Already on the move , along a side street .
Miss Shiftwell ?
ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map .
Mater looks like Pac Man , weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him .
I 've got him in the back alleys east of the garages .
Multiple assailants are closing in quickly .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Keep him moving .
I 'm on my way .
ON MATER - He turns a corner , sees a flower shop .
Hey , new lady friend ?
You like flowers ?
ON THE TRACK - McQueen , hearing this , is taken aback .
What ?
ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
No !
Do n't go ` in ' anywhere .
Just keep moving .
Stay outside .
Gotcha .
ON THE TRACK
Outside ?
McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past !
Grazie and arrivaderci !
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
I can not believe what I just saw , Brent .
That was a bonehead move .
You do n't open up the inside like that !
IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he 's followed by Pacers and Gremlins .
Suddenly ----- CABLES whip in front of them , pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shop 's owners into a frenzy .
They direct their attention to the AMCs , who try and explain .
ON FINN , admiring his handiwork as he appears .
Just as he turns to leave he 's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY .
IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and pushed toward ----- ACER , who now holds a FLAME THROWER .
This time I 'm gon na make sure you stay dead .
He hits the flame .
WHOOOSSSH !
ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along , still looking for Holley .
Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn stares down death :
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
You 're doing brilliantly .
Now just stay focused .
What 's that ?
You want me to head toward that ruckus ?
Mater turns INTO the alley .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
No !
Do n't go down that street !
IN THE ALLEY - Finn , now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower , leaps into the air .
He FIGHTS BACK , using his wheels , axle , indeed his entire car frame as if he were human , kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies .
Mater witnesses the whole thing .
Wow !
A live karate demonstration !
ON THE TRACK - McQueen , now playing catch-up again , scowls .
Stop it , Mater .
Just sign off .
IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line , causing an EXPLOSION that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP 'S SIGN .
ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
They 're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line !
The Formula car gets there first .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Francesco 's the winner , McQueen 's number two !
IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths , surveys his damage .
That was cool !
Hey , can I get your autograph ?
Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door , momentarily blocking Mater 's view of Finn .
Once the fans have past , Finn has disappeared .
Hey , where 'd he go ?
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Our rendezvous has been jeopardized .
Keep the device safe .
We 'll be in touch .
Dadgum , did I miss our date ?
Post race press conference .
Francesco is center stage .
Francesco , over here !
Hey , what was your strategy today ?
Strategia ?
Francesco needs no strategy , it 's very simple .
You start the race , wait for Lightning McQueen to choke , pass him , then win .
Francesco always wins .
It 's boring .
McQueen , waiting in the wings , rolls his eyes .
He suddenly notices something O.S. McQueen 's P.O.V. - It 's MATER , appearing from a side street , moving toward the pits , oblivious of the press conference .
-LRB- TO FRANCESCO . -RRB-
I got ta tell you , dude .
You were in trouble for awhile .
That dirt track section had you crawling !
As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY --
To truly crush one 's dream , you must first raise their hopes very high .
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as McQueen approaches .
Mater .
Hey McQueen !
What happened ?
Is the race over ?
You won , right ?
Mater , why were you yelling things at me while I was racing ?
Yelling ?
Oh , you thought .
that 's funny right there .
Nah , see that 's ` cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance .
It was nutso .
One of them even had a flamethrower --
A flamethrower ?
What are you talking about ?
I do n't understand .
Where were you ?
Going to meet my date .
Your date ?
She started talking to me as a voice in my head , telling me where to go --
What ?
Wait a minute -- I did n't screw you up , did I ?
I lost the race because of you !
Well , I 'm sorry .
I did n't mean --
An imaginary girlfriend , flamethrowers .
This is exactly why I do n't bring you along to these things .
Maybe if I , I do n't know , talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help .
I do n't need your help .
I do n't want your help .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Hey , there he is !
The press finds McQueen , swarms him .
Mater is pushed backwards as the questions fly again .
- McQueen , you had it in the bag !
- Yeah , what happened ?
I made a mistake .
But I can assure you , it wo n't happen again .
On Mater .
He takes this badly .
Look , guys .
We know what the problem is and we 've taken care of it .
OVER FOOTAGE OF FRANCESCO and various other highlights :
Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix and three , count em , three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel , Allinol , might be to blame .
FOOTAGE OF MILES AXLEROD , speaking to an aggressive press .
He must SHOUT over the press .
Allinol is safe !
Alternative fuel is safe !
There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out !
IN THE TV STUDIO - Darrell , Brent and David talk to camera .
Well the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents , but one thing 's for sure : Lightning McQueen blew this race .
Off a FROZEN IMAGE of McQueen crossing the finish line , a look of severe consternation across his face --
Team McQueen ca n't be happy right now .
-- MATCH CUT TO --
-- McQueen 's SMILING FACE , on a Team McQueen poster .
REVERSE to reveal Mater looking at it , sadly .
He drives on , passing -LRB- but not noticing -RRB- ----- GREM and ACER .
AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER .
Cars take off their tires , move through the metal detector .
Mater waits in line .
A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater .
-LRB- in Japanese and English . -RRB-
Come with me please , sir .
But I 'm gon na miss my plane .
IN THE ADMIRAL 'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER .
The Security Car leads Mater inside .
Right this way .
As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL BEARING which rolls into a corner .
The ball bearing then sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS , tripods itself and IRISES out , revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA .
IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL 'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS Mater follows the Security Car in , nervous .
Doggone it .
This is about my hook , is n't it ?
I know I should 've checked it , but I ca n't really , look -- it 's attached to me .
ZWAPPPPPP !
The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself , reveals himself to be Finn McMissile !
Hey , I know you .
You 're that feller from the karate demonstration .
I never properly introduced myself .
Finn McMissile .
British Intelligence .
Tow Mater .
Average intelligence .
Who are you with ?
FBI , CIA ?
Let 's just say I 'm triple-A affiliated .
You know , I know some karate .
I do n't wan na brag or nothing , but I 've got me a black fan belt .
BEEP !
Finn 's rearview alarms .
His camera has picked up Grem and Acer .
They 've just entered the lounge , are right around the corner .
Hey , you wan na see some moves I made up ?
You 're being followed .
Finn quickly turns , fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the window .
As Mater talks , oblivious , the beetle cuts out a round hole .
This first one I can reach into a car 's hood , pull out his battery , and show it to him before he stalls .
I call it , `` What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once . ''
Mater does his best -LRB- worst -RRB- karate moves as Acer and Grem turn the corner .
There he is !
The glass drops away , leaving a car-sized hole .
-LRB- eyes the clock . -RRB-
Look , I probably ought to go .
I 'm about to miss my flight .
Do n't worry .
Finn HOOKS Mater from behind .
He YANKS HIM forward --
I 've taken care of that .
Hang on .
-- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW !
Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac , towing him away from the terminal .
This is First Class service .
You do n't even have to go through the terminal .
ACER and GREM appear , chasing them .
Mater , who is facing backward as he is being pulled along , faces them .
They 're about a hundred yards back .
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
Your karate partners are back here .
They kinda look like they 're trying to catch up !
Drive forward .
Whatever you do , do n't stop .
Finn SKIDS around , whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is now towing Finn .
Grem produces a ROCKET , lines up Finn as his target .
Finn , without hesitation , fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK .
The jack DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem , anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket OFF -- THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn .
FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back .
THE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR , EXPLODE .
-LRB- only hearing this . -RRB-
Is everything okay back there ?
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Finn , it 's Sid .
I 'm on approach .
A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead .
This is SIDDELEY .
Roger that .
Mater looks up : ACER screeches into view up ahead , dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater 's path , attempting to create an accident .
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what ?
Just as it looks dire -- RATATATATATATAT !
SIDDELEY descends , hawklike , fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky-high .
Mater and Finn burst through them , luggage now raining down from above .
I knew I should 've done carry-on !
-LRB- TO SIDDELEY . -RRB-
Thanks , old boy !
Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them .
No time to stop , he DROPS his back open , revealing HOLLEY .
Hey , doggone it .
It 's my imaginary girlfriend !
Come on !
Get in here !
Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley 's ramp , Holley .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
Boy I tell you what , you really do want this first date , do n't ya ?
That 's a no-quit attitude right there .
Just as Mater 's wheels touch the ramp , BULLETS PING around him in a spray .
Siddeley is HIT , a tire BLOWN .
He yells in pain .
Hold on , Sid !
Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass .
A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer .
Finn SHOOTS ACER 'S TIRE , blowing it and throwing him off-course .
Acer CAREENS out of control , drives up and THROUGH A JET ----- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker .
ON SIDDELEY - He 's headed toward the edge of the tarmac , where the grass and runway meet WATER .
He HITS THE GAS , his only hope .
Finn , it 's now or never !
Finn BRAKES , 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets air .
Hold on !
Mater , the only thing not in the jet , dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds .
As he 's PULLED in through the back hatch :
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
By the time you read this , I will be safely on an airplane , flying home .
CLOSE ON a handwritten -LRB- er , tire-written ? -RRB-
NOTE in childish scrawl .
We do n't see all of it , only a bit .
Mater 's voice O.S. begins the note with the first sentence , but we DISSOLVE into McQueen 's voice .
`` I 'm so sorry for what I did .
I do n't want to be the cause of you losing any more races .
I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world .
Your best friend , Mater . ''
McQueen takes this in .
I did n't really want him to leave .
Wait , there 's more here .
-LRB- READS . -RRB-
`` P.S. Please tell the hotel I did n't mean to order that movie .
I thought it was just a preview and I did n't realize I was paying for it .
P.P.S .
That 's funny right there - PP . ''
-LRB- to the others . -RRB-
There 's a few more pages of P.S. 's here .
-LRB- TURNING BACK . -RRB-
Well , at least I know if he 's at home he 'll be safe .
SIDDELEY breaks through some cloud cover , flies with purpose .
A well-appointed spy jet .
Various computers line the walls .
Now that 's how I like to start the day !
You never feel more alive than when you 're almost dead .
-LRB- SCANNING MATER . -RRB-
I hope that device did n't fall off .
That 's the closest I ever been to missing my flight !
That was --
With a ROBOTIC ARM , Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod Redline hid under Mater .
She yanks it out with a GOOSE .
-LRB- JUMPS . -RRB-
Yow !
Still in one piece , great .
Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer .
It starts `` ANALYZING . ''
I got ta go to a doctor .
I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage .
Downloading the photo now .
Hey , lem me introduce you two .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
This here is Finn McSomething-orother .
He 's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit .
And Finn , this here 's my date .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
I never did get your name .
Oh yes , sorry .
It 's Shiftwell .
Holley Shiftwell .
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
It 's Shiftwell .
Holley --
DING !
The computer is done analyzing .
The cabin lights dim .
Finally .
Time to see who 's behind all this .
AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them .
It 's of a photograph , a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together .
-LRB- to Mater , expectantly . -RRB-
What is this ?
Well , that 's one of the worst engines ever made .
It 's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts .
Shoot , them Whitworth bolts is a pain , tell you what .
Them ai n't metric , they ai n't inches .
Yes , OK , right .
But who 's engine is this , Mater ?
Well , it 's kinda hard to tell from this picture , ai n't it ?
But you 're the one who took it .
Holley .
Oh , right .
Yes , of course .
`` A good agent gets what he can , then gets out before he 's killed . ''
Sorry .
Agent ?
You mean like insurance agent , like .
-LRB- SINGS . -RRB-
` Like a good neighbor , Mater is there ' ?
Wait , you mean secret agents .
You guys is spies !
Holley , in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear ?
Holley has these stats in seconds .
Kid 's play .
It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period .
At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine .
Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD , through one part of the hologram so he 's face-to-face with Holley .
You 're pretty .
-LRB- ANNOYED . -RRB-
Yes , alright .
Thank you .
And so nice .
Just pay attention .
She moves the engine photo so it 's now blocking Mater again .
This seems like a dead end .
If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I 'd be a lot happier .
You might not be happy , but I bet this feller is .
See how he 's had most of his parts replaced ?
And see all them boxes over there ?
Them 's all original parts .
They ai n't easy to come by .
Rare parts .
That 's something we can track .
Exactly !
Holley drops her screen down .
Well done , Mater !
I would never have seen that .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris , a treacherous lowlife .
But , he 's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is .
Mater , what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one ?
Wait , what ?
You obviously have plenty of experience in the field .
Well yeah I live right next to one .
-LRB- thinks about it . -RRB-
I do n't know , Finn .
I ai n't exactly been much help to anybody recently .
You 're helping me .
Please , Mater .
Well , okay .
But you know I 'm just a tow truck , right ?
Right .
And I 'm just in the import/export business .
Siddeley ?
Yes , Finn ?
Paris .
Tout de suite .
Yeah , two of them sweets for me too , Sid !
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
You know , I always wanted to be a spy .
-LRB- SMILING SWEETLY . -RRB-
Really ?
Me too .
Afterburners , sir ?
Is there any other way ?
Siddeley HITS THE JUICE , they kick forward like a mule as we CUT TO -- A MONTAGE OF PARIS : Mater attempts to merge into roundabout traffic ; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower ; a painter works his magic on an unattractive couple ; a couple kisses on the most romantic spot in the world ; we might even catch GASTOW 'S RESTAURANT .
The charming , low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA of Paris 's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO --
-- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement .
Finn and Holley drive along together as Mater , playing `` spy , '' darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster , `` hiding out . ''
He 's having a ball .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
Once we 're inside , stay close .
Do n't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records , they 're all dodgy here .
No VIN scans .
Got it .
Do n't talk to anyone .
Do n't look at anyone .
And absolutely , positively no idling .
Are we clear ?
Yes , right .
No idling .
Yes , sir .
Mater ?
Yeah , Finn ?
We 're not here to go shopping .
As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner .
Shopping ?
What do you mean ?
Why would I --
Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Hallesinspired Parisian market filled with car parts .
A tow truck 's dream .
Dadgum .
- Parts for sale , Monsieur !
- Monsieur !
Parts for sale !
IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER Mater rolls along , impressed by the goods for sale .
You got ta be kidding me - they 've got everything here .
Look at them hoods !
I could use a hood .
Mater continues on though , heeding Finn 's advice .
Sorry fellers , I got ta go .
Mater , now out of sight of Finn and Holley , passes a darkened stall .
He STOPS , peers in .
There 's someone in there .
Excuse me .
What are you selling ?
It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing .
EYES !
In French , the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater .
Mater FREAKS OUT , speeds off , TERRIFIED .
AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY A few car lengths ahead of Mater .
They roll along , looking for .
Aha !
Finn and Holley recede into the shadows .
In FINN 'S SIDE MIRROR : TOMBER , a three-wheeled parts dealer , argues with a French customer .
There you are .
Mater suddenly turns the corner , sees Finn and Holley .
Man , there are some great --
Mater , get back !
Too late .
Tomber sees Mater , then notices FINN , reflected in a hubcap .
He BOLTS .
Finn and Holley give chase .
Hey , wait for me !
Tomber , skidding away , kicks a tent in Finn 's way .
Holley quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears .
Where did she go ?
Finn , hot in pursuit , leaps another obstacle and loses ground TO ----- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with HOLLEY .
He whips to the left but TURNS OVER , rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop .
Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS .
Finn suddenly arrives , stops her .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
Have you lost your mind ?!
But I thought --
Mater !
This chap needs a tow .
Hook him up .
Sure thing .
MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber , following Finn and Holley .
You rusty piece of junk , get your dirty hook off me !
Finn throws open a door .
Cars scatter like cockroaches .
-LRB- to the cars . -RRB-
Allez !
Maintenant - vite !
Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French .
Finn pulls the door down .
As it LATCHES TIGHT --
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
Electroshock !
Are you kidding me ?
Easy , Tomber .
This is her first field assignment - she did n't know you were my informant .
Informant ?
A rookie , eh ?
I never liked new carsmell .
Holley FUMES with anger .
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him , if I recall correctly .
Speaking of recalls , you 're getting up there in mileage are n't you , Finn ?
Alright , we get it .
You both know each other , you 're both old .
So .
Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of Tomber .
There you go , informant .
Inform us .
Tomber eyes the photo .
He recoils , unimpressed .
That is the worst motor ever made .
Suddenly , Tomber narrows his gaze .
Wait .
That oil filter .
those wheel bearings .
Do those parts look familiar , Tomber ?
They should .
I sold them .
To whom ?
No idea .
He 's my best customer , but he always does his business over the phone .
I was always wondering why he needs so many parts .
Now I know .
Well , a lemon needs parts .
Ai n't nothing truer than that .
`` Lemon ? ''
Yeah , you know .
Cars that do n't ever work right .
Lemons is a tow truck 's bread and butter .
Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport .
Holley , pull up the pictures from the oil platform .
I want to know what other type of cars were out there .
Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them .
Right .
Let 's see .
There were Hugos .
And Trunkovs .
Mater , are these cars considered lemons ?
Is the Popemobile Catholic ?
Finn .
Everyone involved in this plot is one of history 's biggest loser cars .
Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO , which now rises forward as the prominent picture , perhaps the only one in view .
And they 're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine .
This explains it !
What , Tomber ?
Gremlin , Pacer , Hugo and Trunkovs never get together .
But they 're having a secret meeting in two days .
Where 's this meeting taking place ?
Porto Corsa , Italy .
That 's where the next race is !
Then there 's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too .
Your chances are more than good .
I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday .
to Porto Corsa .
Holley , contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon .
Good work .
STEPHENSON , a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a snow-covered mountain in the dead of night , its halogen headlight cutting through the darkness .
It DIPS into a TUNNEL -- MATER -LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Boy , I 'll tell you what .
That threewheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting .
Mater , Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street .
They 're in the front train car , which doubles as a luxury seating area and intelligence command center .
You never see this many lemons in one town .
Unless there 's a swap meet , or something .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- CONT 'D . -RRB-
Hey , how 'd you get all them pictures ?
Well , I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa 's red light cameras to do recognition scans .
Wow , not only is you the prettiest car I ever met , but you the smartest too .
Thank you .
I think .
That 's a familiar sight .
Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO , the HUGO Lemonhead , being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK .
A Hugo being towed .
But he looks absolutely perfect .
Of course .
They must be the heads of the lemon families .
Makes sense .
If I was rich and broke down every day , I 'd hire me to tow me around all the time too .
We 've got to infiltrate that meeting .
It 's the only way to find out who 's behind all this .
-LRB- EYEING MATER . -RRB-
Hang on a minute .
What ?
Hold still .
Holley SNAPS Mater 's picture , temporarily blinding him .
Ahh !
Holley turns back to her monitor .
Mater 's face appears on screen .
She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo 's tow truck 's .
Good job , Miss Shiftwell .
Holley is n't sure what surprises her more : the compliment or how pleased it makes her .
Thank you , Finn .
Boy , I sure wish my friends could see me now .
A quaint Italian piazza .
A pristine MASERATI FOUNTAIN , complete with ancient trident , looms in our view .
Luigi and Guido roll into view .
Guido , your eyes do not deceive you .
We are in Italy .
We are home !
Sarge , Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck .
Hey , Luigi .
Which way to the hotel , man ?
What ?
No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village .
You will stay with my -- Uncle Topolino !
UNCLE TOPOLINO , a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino , rolls forward .
He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi 's arrival spreads .
The square FILLS with family and friends .
A festive homecoming party .
Lights strung across the square .
Music and dancing .
Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table .
How do they do it ?
These are the same ingredients as back home , but it tastes so good .
It 's organic , man .
Tree hugger .
LIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square , seems lost in thought .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Race car .
Uncle Topolino beckons McQueen over .
You look so down , so low .
Is like you have flat tires .
MAMA TOPOLINO , a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up , a mile a minute then drives off , now a car on a mission .
She said you look like you 're starving .
That she 's going to make you a big meal , and fatten you up .
No , Mama Topolino , please .
You do n't need to make a fuss !
Too late .
She 's disappeared inside her kitchen .
Capisco .
I understand .
Is a problem , yes ?
Between you and a friend ?
How 'd you know that ?
A wise car hears one word and understands two .
McQueen takes this in , impressed .
That , and Luigi told me .
While Mama cooks , come and take a stroll with me .
They amble forward , Uncle Topolino setting the pace .
I brought my friend Mater along on the trip .
And I told him he needed to act different , that we were n't in Radiator Springs .
This Mater .
He 's a close friend ?
He 's my best friend .
Then why would you ask him to be someone else ?
McQueen considers this - a realization .
What did I do ?
I said some things during our fight .
You know , back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me , they would fight over everything .
IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl .
Luigi suddenly CUTS IN .
They begin to ARGUE .
They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari ; which one of them look more like a Ferrari .
There were even some non-Ferrari fights .
Guido now LIFTS Luigi , cuts BACK in .
So I tell them , va bene .
It 's okay to fight .
Everybody fights now and then , especially best friends .
McQueen takes this in .
Seems to take some small comfort .
But you got ta make up fast .
McQueen 's comfort quickly evaporates .
No fight more important than friendship .
Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived .
All having a great time .
They dance past us , crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE TOPOLINO .
We STAY WITH them .
Chi trova un ` amico , trova un tesoro .
What does that mean ?
-LRB- ARRIVING . -RRB-
Whoever find a friend , find a treasure .
Mama Topolino drops a tray of food in front of McQueen .
Now , mangia !
Eat !
ON MCQUEEN , distant , taking all of this in , lost in thought as , in the background , Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk , then argue , then make up -LRB- all in Italian -RRB- all while we stay on McQueen 's pensive face --
Stephenson glides along , all business .
Finn , one hour to Porto Corsa .
Thank you , Stephenson .
Finn watches as HOLLEY attaches a new EMERGENCY LIGHT on Mater 's roof .
It looks exactly like his old one .
That should just about do it .
Perfect .
So Mater , it 's voice-activated .
But you know , everything 's voiceactivated these days .
What ?
I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise .
Voice recognized .
Disguise Program Initiated .
ZWWWWAT !
A HOLOGRAPHIC disguise suddenly umbrellas out , emitted from Mater 's roof .
It drops a clean cloaking image of the EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK over Mater .
Cool !
Hey , computer .
Make me a German truck !
Request acknowledged .
ZWATTTT !
Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat .
Check it out .
I 'm wearing Materhosen .
Make me a monster truck !
Request acknowledged .
He 's transformed into Dracula , complete with fangs .
-LRB- ALA DRACULA . -RRB-
I vant to siphon your gas .
Now make me a taco truck !
Request acknowledged .
A funny car !
Request acknowledged .
Finn suddenly pushes a button , stops the madness .
The idea is to keep a low profile , Mater .
Mater , chastened , moves on .
So I just go in , pretend to be this truck .
And leave the rest to us .
Now hold still .
Holley turns back to her work .
The disguise 's cloaking is larger than Mater .
As a result , Holley must dial it back to fit his body .
As she carefully calibrates the hologram :
I have to do the final fitting on your disguise .
Holley STOPS .
The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame , but dents SHOW THROUGH .
Oh dear .
That 's no good .
She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm , moves it toward one of Mater 's DENTS .
Mater pulls away .
Hey , what are you doing ?
The disguise wo n't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto .
Oh .
For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents .
I was .
Well then no thank you .
I do n't get them dents buffed , pulled , filled or painted by nobody .
They 're way too valuable .
Your dents are valuable ?
I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen .
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- CONT 'D . -RRB-
I do n't fix these .
I want to remember these dents forever .
So you were being serious in Paris ?
McQueen is n't just part of your cover ?
Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work , Mater .
But my line of work is towing and salvage .
Right .
And Miss Shiftwell 's is designing iPhone apps .
No , I meant for real .
I --
It 's okay .
Say no more .
I 'll work around the dent .
In the meantime .
Finn hits a button .
The walls transform into a MASSIVE WEAPONS CACHE .
You look a little light on weapons .
Off Mater 's RXN --
-- STEPHENSON EMERGES LOUDLY from a tunnel .
He powers forward , starts his descent into Italy --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
You are looking live at beautiful Porto Corsa , Italy , on the Italian Riviera .
What a magnificent setting for the second race of the World Grand Prix .
Over sweeping helicopter BEAUTY SHOTS :
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Well Brent , they call this place `` The Gem of the Riviera , '' and it 's easy to see why .
A local fishing boat chugs through an idyllic waterway , beneath bridges that connect hillside villas .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
With its secluded beaches and opulent casinos , Porto Corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy .
A long line of RICH-LOOKING YACHTS in the harbor .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And everyone who 's anyone is here today .
Rich SPORTS CARS drive past pricey shops .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
From the ultra-rich and superfamous , to world leaders and important dignitaries .
THE POPEMOBILE , visible in a crowd , drives through town .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
You are n't kidding , David .
You ca n't do a three-point turn around here without bumping into some celebrity !
HELICOPTER SHOT of the Casino .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Welcome everyone to the second race of the World Grand Prix !
MUSTANGBURGER , HOBBSCAP and CARTRIP in the control booth .
The big news continues to be Allinol .
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety .
FOOTAGE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE - Miles Axlerod , at a podium , addresses the press throng .
He looks a bit exasperated .
An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe .
Okay ?
Safe !
There it is .
So the race will go on , folks .
RACE GRAPHICS show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the race standings .
But the question everyone is asking : Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today ?
ON THE TRACK - As the racers begin to get into position on the grid .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Well , he better .
Talk about a hometrack advantage .
Francesco Bernoulli grew up racing on this course .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Signore e signori , in the pole position , numero uno .
The crowd is cheering already , knows who this is .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Francescoooooo !
The Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero .
-LRB- to the crowd . -RRB-
Bellissima !
Thank you for your support .
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
And your big mistake , McQueen !
McQueen missed this comment .
He approaches his grid position , lost in thought .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
In the secondo position .
Numero novantacinque .
Lightning McQueen !
Cheers -LRB- not so thunderous , obviously -RRB- from the crowd .
McQueen does n't seem to notice .
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT - His team exchanges looks , worried .
McQueen ?
Is everything okay ?
If you 're worried about your fuel , man , do n't .
It 's perfectly safe .
BACK ON THE STARTING GRID
No , guys , I just really wish Mater were here .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Francesco understands , McQueen .
Francesco parks next to him , grinning .
Oh , great .
Here it comes .
What 've you got , Francesco ?
For famous race cars like Francesco and well .
you , to be far away from home is not easy .
I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult .
Is no insult .
When Francesco is away from home , he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico .
Gee , I maybe misjudged you , because that 's exactly how I --
Of course , I am at home .
And my mama is right here .
Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the crowd , cheering him on , blowing him kisses .
-LRB- YELLS . -RRB-
Mama !
Do n't worry , Mama !
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- CONT 'D . -RRB-
McQueen is very sad !
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today !
And there 's the insult we were missing .
Grazie !
THE LIGHTS - CLICK FROM RED TO GREEN -- THE RACERS TAKE OFF !
SHOTS of the racers making the first few turns through the city streets .
We PAN to the CASINO DI PORTO CORSA .
The Beaux Arts-style architecture towers atop a hill , overlooks the course .
A group of thuggish HUGOS - ugly Eastern European cars - wait impatiently at the front .
A LIMOUSINE-STYLE car carrier rolls up to the roundabout .
An esteemed , elderly GREMLIN rolls past with a group of GREMLIN THUGS who usher him into the casino .
Gremlins .
Man , those are some ugly cars .
Look like someone stole their trunks .
The THUGS all SNICKER .
Scusatemi , tutti !
Signori !
Holley arrives , sporting a decent Italian accent .
Mio nonno , my grandfather , has broken down .
If one of you would help I would be so thankful .
IVAN , AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK -LRB- the one Holley and Finn prepped Mater to impersonate -RRB- , drives forward .
Sounds like you need some `` roadside assistance '' .
She was talking to me , Ivan .
Oh really ?
Prove it .
No , no , do n't fight over me .
Holley directs her interest toward Ivan .
Signore Tow Truck , per favore ?
MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a corner .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Get ready , Mater .
FINN , at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds .
You 're on any moment now .
MATER , now looking a bit nervous .
He backs out of sight .
I do n't know about this , Finn .
What if I screw things up ?
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Impossible .
Just apply the same level of dedication you 've been using to play the `` idiot tow truck '' and you 'll be fine .
It 's just that them guys look pretty tough and -- Wait , did you say `` idiot '' ?
Is that how you see me ?
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
That 's how everyone sees you .
Is n't that the idea ?
I tell you , that 's the genius of it .
No one realizes they 're being fooled because they 're too busy laughing at the fool .
Brilliant .
While Finn talks , Mater takes this in .
He catches his own reflection in a nearby window .
Seems to be seeing himself with new eyes .
ZZZZATTT !
Mater jumps at the sound , turns in time to see Ivan SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley 's ZAPPERS .
Why are n't you in disguise ?
I , uh --
Come on , there 's no time .
Go !
Okay , okay .
Computer : disguise .
Request acknowledged .
Mater , now disguised as Ivan the Tow Truck , approaches the Hugos .
Another LIMO CAR CARRIER arrives .
It 's the boss !
He is coming !
The carrier parks and the back opens .
VICTOR HUGO waits .
Ivan !
Mater realizes Victor is talking to him .
He hops to it .
Ivan , why do you insult me so by making me wait ?
Mater , now with Victor hooked , tows him in the front doors of the casino .
ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display .
He 's in .
McQueen and Francesco battle for first place --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
The racers are now making their way around the hairpin , and headed downhill toward the casino bridge .
Cars play craps with FUZZY DICE ; slot machines with odometers for jackpot numbers ; cigarette girls sell car items .
Air Freshener , antenna balls , sparkplugs .
ON MATER - He tows VICTOR .
They are flanked on all four corners by Hugo thugs , ala a presidential motorcade .
The largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater out of his funk .
-LRB- WIDE-EYED . -RRB-
Wow , this place looks like it 's made out of gold .
The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
That 's because it is , Mater .
Now , be careful what you say .
Why is that ?
What do you mean do n't talk to you ?
-LRB- more talking from Holley which we can not hear . -RRB-
So you want me to stop talking to you .
Right now ?
You are acting strange today , Ivan .
I have no idea what you 're talking about .
MATER 'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside .
Alexander Hugo , aka `` Chop Shop Alex. ''
IN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all but Mater .
Some of Alex 's other alias ' include `` Alexander HuDo n't Go '' and `` Alexander the Not-So Great . ''
Hey , you got a lot of aka 's , Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you 's wanted in France , Germany , the Czech Republic .
-LRB- cutting in to his DISPLAY . -RRB-
Mater !
Stop it !
Alexander Hugo , unaware of Holley 's interruption , whispers to Mater as they turn a corner .
Okay , okay .
Keep your voice down .
You 're gon na make me arrested .
-LRB- to the other Hugos . -RRB-
Do n't mess with Ivan today .
He 's in a bad mood .
Holley , hearing this , ca n't believe it .
He 's so good .
Mater tows Victor inside a private room , where inside are the WORLD 'S WORST CARS including VLADMIR TRUNKOV , TUBBS PACER and J. CURBY GREMLIN .
Victor !
Hey , Victor !
J. CURBY GREMLIN There you are .
Come in , come in .
J. CURBY GREMLIN Victor Hugo .
I 'm J. Curby Gremlin , from Detroit .
It 's good to see you .
Now we can start .
Is the big boss here yet ?
No , not yet .
He 's supposed to be here any minute .
WHAM !
A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns , now silent .
ON THE DOOR - It sits open .
No one enters .
The room of Lemons watch , nervous .
ON MATER - Nervously watching too .
Here we go .
A car finally appears .
It 's Zundapp .
Guten Tag !
Everyone looks disappointed .
It 's just the Professor .
Zundapp , when is he coming ?
He 's already here .
MONITORS descend from the ceiling .
On them , an image of AN ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo .
But this is a LIVE image .
The car is being worked on .
Welcome , everyone .
The VOICE is garbled , scrambled .
No way to determine who .
I wish I could be with you on this very special day but .
my clutch assembly broke .
You know how it is .
The Lemons all nod in understanding .
Been there .
J. CURBY GREMLIN Forget about it .
We know how you feel .
Descramble that voice !
-LRB- already on it . -RRB-
I 'm trying .
It 's too sophisticated !
We are here to celebrate .
Today all your hard work pays off .
The world turned their backs on cars like us .
They stopped manufacturing us , stopped making our parts .
The only thing they have n't stopped doing is laughing at us .
They 've called us terrible names .
On VICTOR HUGO .
Jalopy .
Rustbucket .
On TUBBS PACER .
Heap .
Clunker .
On J. CURBY GREMLIN :
Junker , beater , wreck .
On ZUNDAPP .
Rattletrap .
And finally back on the monitor .
The ENGINE .
Lemon .
But their insults just give us strength .
Because today , my friends .
The monitors switch to LIVE RACE FOOTAGE .
that all ends .
On the VIDEO SCREENS - CARLA VELOSO 'S ENGINE BLOWS --
Veloso swerves , attempts to mitigate a crash --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
There 's smoke !
On the casino bridge !
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Oh no .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
It 's Carla Veloso , the Brazilian race car .
She skids into a wall , hard .
What just happened ?
-LRB- analyzing the data . -RRB-
I 'm working on it .
The lemons are CHEERING .
Mater is freaked out .
They laughed at us .
But now it 's our turn to laugh back .
BOOM !
Another racer blows an engine .
Mater JUMPS again .
As the racer smashes into the railing --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Another crash !
It 's number nine , Nigel Gearsley .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Embrace your inner lemon !
Let it drive you !
Holley ?
I 'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse .
Holley replays that last crash .
The OUTLINE OF THE BEAM is seen hitting the racer .
Holley TRACES THIS to its source ----- a WGP CAMERA , which Grem and Acer have pointed at the racers from a tower position .
Finn , it 's the camera !
Where ?
On the tower .
Finn TAKES OFF , speeding toward Grem and Acer --
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
This was meant to be alternative fuel 's greatest moment .
Angry fans knock over cans of Allinol .
One drives over an Allinol sign .
They 're fed up with it .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
After today everyone will race back to gasoline .
We RACK FOCUS to reveal another fan as he RIPS an Allinol banner down angrily .
The video screens are now filled with ONE IMAGE - of the OIL PLATFORMS in the Pacific from the beginning of the movie .
And we , the owners of the world 's largest untapped oil reserve , will become the most powerful cars in the world !
Finn ducks , weaves , speeds , and pushes his way through BYSTANDERS --
Get out of the way !
Andate !
He speeds furiously through town .
McQueen and Francesco FLY PAST US .
They will come to us and they will have no choice , ` cause they will need us .
ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road , Grem and Acer visible ahead of him .
He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins -- Suddenly , FINN FREEZES .
He 's immobilized in mid-air !
He looks up .
A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him .
-LRB- TO FINN . -RRB-
We figured you might stop by .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And they will finally respect us .
So hold your hoods high .
After today you will never again be ashamed of who you are !
Grem and Acer turn back to the camera .
They line up Shu Todoroki , who 's a bit further along now .
No !
Long live Lemons !
Grem ZAPS THE RACER .
Flames burst from Todoroki .
He loses control .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Number seven is loose !
Shu Todoroki !
Shu takes down three more cars with him and others follow suit .
It 's a nightmare pileup .
Holley sees Finn being flown away by the chopper .
Finn .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line .
McQueen NOSES out Francesco for a win , both oblivious to what 's just happened .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
McQueen 's the winner , Francesco 's second .
And they have no idea what happened behind them .
Yeah !
Dah !
This is impossible !
That 's what I 'm talking about .
Kachow !
Hey , where are all the other cars ?
What is going on ?
They see the pile-up from an overhead monitor .
Sirens blare as a MEDIC CHOPPER flies to the scene of the pile-up .
-LRB- REALIZES . -RRB-
Oh no .
MILES AXLEROD - LATER .
He 's near the casino .
He 's completely surrounded , 360 degrees , by press .
He 's drowned out by a blizzard of questions .
Sir Axlerod !
Is the final race in London still going to take place ?
PULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads , Zundapp and Mater .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
I suppose that .
Look , `` the show must go on '' as they say .
But now is not the time to talk about .
J. CURBY GREMLIN I ca n't believe this is really happening .
Shh , quiet !
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
And Allinol ?
Will you require all the racers to still run on Allinol ?
Here it comes .
On Miles Axlerod : He 's devastated .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
I can not in good conscience continue to risk the lives of any more race cars .
The final race will not be run on Allinol .
WILD WHOOPING CHEERS fill the room .
Lemonade corks are popped .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
There you have it .
A clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race .
A toast !
To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever !
Holley is already on the run .
Speeding away .
Mater .
Abort the mission .
They 've got Finn .
Get out of there .
Get out of there right now !
She turns a corner and STOPS .
Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked before .
Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER , LOOMS .
How is your grandfather ?
The Lemonheads celebrate , chant `` Long live lemons ! ''
Mater , scared , turns to leave .
He 's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO .
Is n't this a great party , Ivan ?
Oh yeah , it 's unbelievable .
You are not leaving , are you ?
Uh , of course I ai n't leavin ' .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
I 'm just in shock like everybody .
McQueen ?
He turns , sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the monitors .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Crashes are part of racing , I know .
But something like that should n't ever happen .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
They 're letting you choose your fuel for the final race .
Do you have any idea what it 's going to be ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
Allinol .
The excitement suddenly DRAINS from the room .
- What ?!
- Did he just say Allinol ?
After today ?
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
My friend Fillmore says the fuel 's safe .
That 's good enough for me .
I did n't stand by a friend of mine recently .
I 'm not gon na make the same mistake twice .
On Mater .
He takes this in .
-LRB- ON TV . -RRB-
So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen .
Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who , based on his angry O.S. voice , sounds ticked off .
Yes , sir .
Of course .
Zundapp hangs up , turns to the room .
Allinol must be finished for good .
McQueen can not win the last race .
Lightning McQueen must be killed .
Mater 's eyes open wide .
No !
Mater backs up , KNOCKING his emergency light against one of the monitors .
ZZZZZAT !
His holographic disguise flickers away then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises , finally revealing rusty old Mater .
It 's the American spy !
The thugs DRAW TERRIFYING WEAPONS .
Dadgum .
`` Gatling gun '' request acknowledged .
WHIRRRRR !
GUNS roll out of Mater on each side .
Shoot .
I did n't mean --
Request acknowledged .
Mater SPRAYS BULLETS into the crowd .
Get down !
Whoa !
The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE -- Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns , back through some double doors and onto a BALCONY .
Wait wait !
I did n't mean that kind of shoot !
Correction acknowledged .
Deploying chute .
WHOOM !
A PARACHUTE BURSTS out of the back of Mater , he catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY !
The Lemonheads watch him float away , amazed .
ON MATER , out of the frying pan but still toasty .
He looks around , notices : LIGHTNING MCQUEEN , far away , leaving the press podium .
McQueen !
Mater looks down at the harbor , over which he flies .
He spots a MOTORBOAT .
Mater WHIPS his hook down , steals a ride behind the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN .
Aspetti !
The motorboat is n't happy about this , tries to shake him .
Mater is THROWN INTO A `` HOTEL '' sign , then SMASHES down through a Francesco souvenir stand .
As he CRASHES onto the ground hard , we SMASH CUT TO --
-- a barricade .
Separating the press from the public , ITALIAN SECURITY TRUCKS stand guard .
Lem me through !
Lem me through !
MATER barrels around a corner .
He 's now covered in Francesco memorabilia and palm leaves .
The word ` HOT ' now dangles off him like the world 's biggest bling .
He looks INSANE .
-LRB- TO SECURITY . -RRB-
You got ta let me in !
I got ta get through to warn McQueen !
Security eyes one another .
This is serious .
You can not come through here .
Back up , signore .
-LRB- into a walkie-talkie . -RRB-
We have a lunatic at Gate Nove .
No , listen !
I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was SAYING --
I repeat .
Lunatic at Gate Nove .
Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance .
McQueen !
McQueen !
JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit .
Right this way , signore .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
-LRB- DISTANT . -RRB-
McQueen !
Mater ?
McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES , flashbulbs , cameras , TV trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky .
BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater , like a nimble running back , dances around to avoid capture by security .
McQueen !
Back up , sir .
Stop moving !
Stop !
Mater head fakes them and pushes through , into the crowd --
Oy !
Stop !
Ferma li !
IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through .
He 's still far in the back .
McQueen !
ON MCQUEEN
That really sounded like Mater .
Mater ?
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
Signore .
ON MATER , getting CLOSER .
McQueen , they 're gon na kill you !
ON MCQUEEN - Okay , he 's positive that was his friend , but where is he ?
Mater ?!
McQueen spots a TOW HOOK , moving through the crowd toward him , `` Jaws '' - like .
Excuse me .
McQueen disappears into the press crowd .
No , no , where are you going ?
Please , Mr. McQueen !
McQueen pushes through the press .
Scusi .
Mater !
Scusi .
McQueen tracks the tow hook , gets closer .
He pushes through the last few vehicles --
Mater , I 'm so glad to see you .
I 'm so sorr --
It 's NOT MATER .
It 's IVAN , the Hugo Thug 's tow truck .
Lightning McQueen !
I am a huge fan .
-LRB- CONFUSED . -RRB-
Oh , I 'm sorry .
I thought I heard --
Yes , but that was me .
I said , `` You killed out there today . ''
You 're the best .
What ?
Oh .
I mean , thanks .
Right this way , signore --
Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen back in the other direction --
-LRB- as he 's pulled away . -RRB-
I really thought I heard my friend .
As he 's pulled away , press and onlookers start to come between him and Ivan , who has n't moved .
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
In England you 'll be finished .
At the finish line .
Ivan is now obscured again .
Wait , what ?
The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm .
Please , the world press is waiting .
You come with me , please .
McQueen is pulled back --
-- just as Mater , now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED , is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle .
He lands hard on his side , spits out his TAPE .
Let me go !
You actually care about that race car .
A pity you did n't warn him in time .
As the doors close on Mater -- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT !
A thick , noxious gas starts to fill the truck .
On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic .
HIS EYES CLOSE .
BLACK SCREEN .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Idiot ?
Is that how you see me ?
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
That 's how everyone sees you .
I tell you , that 's the genius of it .
FADE IN on Mater , back at the Casino , eyeing his reflection in the glass window .
It 's the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a DETACHED , FLOATING PERSPECTIVE .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
No one realizes they 're being fooled because they 're too busy laughing at the fool .
- IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again , from before .
Mater makes a spectacle of himself , WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the stands with the face paint on .
Domo arigato !
McQueen , Fillmore , Guido , Luigi , Sarge and patrons eye Mater , embarrassed and angry .
- IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the Zen rock garden 's glass .
Except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions .
You done good !
You got all the leaves !
Check out that tow truck .
I wonder who that guy 's with ?
-LRB- HUMILIATED . -RRB-
Will you guys excuse me just for one little second ?
We now REVEAL that this FLOATING , THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is MATER .
He 's INSIDE his past , watching it from others ' points of view .
He does n't like what he sees .
- ON MATER , now at the sushi bar .
Now that 's a scoop of ice cream !
Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite .
He SCREAMS !
The sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail .
- ON THE FOUNTAIN , as Mater peels into full view of everyone else at the party .
As Mater laps up water from a fountain :
-LRB- EMBARRASSED . -RRB-
Mater ?!
ALL THE RACERS , with FRANCESCO front and center , guffaw at Mater .
- On MCQUEEN , now scolding Mater moments later .
I never leak oil .
Never .
Mater , you have to get a hold of yourself .
You 're making a scene !
- IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT GARAGE , after the Japanese race .
Wait a minute .
I did n't screw you up , did I ?
I lost the race because of you !
Maybe if I talked to somebody , or --
I do n't need your help .
I do n't want your help !
- Now BACK AT THE PARTY , a moment we did n't see before but which presumably happened .
Mater is BANGING a ceremonial GONG , to the horror of Japanese guests .
Bang a gong , get it on !
GONNNNNNG !
-- On the PARTYGOERS , RACE CARS , PARTY STAFF - they 're all laughing at Mater as McQueen 's final words blend in , making a
Listen , this is n't Radiator Springs .
This is exactly why I do n't bring you along to these things !
Off the GONG at the party --
-- to the GONG of a CLOCK .
CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES .
All around him , all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED CLOCKWORK .
HOLLEY and FINN are here too , strapped bumper to bumper in the divots of large clock movements .
Holley !
Finn !
Where are we ?
We 're in London , Mater .
Inside Big Bentley .
The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute .
It 's 3 PM .
Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ----- whirring , scary machinery .
Woaaaah !
--
WHAP !
The chain yanks to a STOP .
Mater , instead of being 30 feet from death , is now 20 .
Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed themselves .
The clock ticks to 3:01 .
This .
this is all my fault .
Do n't be a fool , Mater .
But I am , remember ?
You said so .
When did I .
Oh .
Mater , I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are .
I 'm not a spy !
This echoes throughout the clock .
I 've been trying to tell you that the whole time .
I really am just a tow truck .
Finn and Holley take this in .
Finn , he 's not joking .
I know .
You were right , Finn .
I 'm a fool .
And what 's happened to McQueen is ` cause I 'm such a big one .
This is all my fault .
GREM and ACER arrive on a lift , roll into view on a catwalk .
Good , you 're up !
And just in time !
Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen .
-LRB- HOPEFUL . -RRB-
He 's still alive ?
Acer whips a sheet away , revealing the WGP CAMERA , turns it toward the clock face .
Not for much longer .
He pushes the camera through an open small window , turns it toward the course .
Mater DROPS down again -- FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD .
Big Bentley 's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute .
But we 're a bit farther away from it than before .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
We came as soon as you called .
Sally , flanked by Red , Flo and Ramone , are in front of ------ McQueen and the rest of the team .
I called to talk to Mater .
It never occurred to me that he would n't be there .
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now .
And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military .
You just need to focus on the race .
I know , but Sal , with everything going on I 'm not sure I should --
A HORN O.S. Someone 's entering the pit .
Everyone parts , revealing MILES AXLEROD .
Sir Axlerod .
I 'm sorry to interrupt .
No , no , it 's all right .
I just wanted to come down here and personally thank you .
Because after Italy , I was finished .
And then you gave me one last shot .
Listen , I --
And I probably should n't be saying this at all but .
I hope you win today .
Show the world that they 've been wrong about Allinol .
McQueen takes this in .
He looks at Sally .
Mater would want you to race .
All right .
For Mater .
TIRES SQUEAL -- MCQUEEN , FRANCESCO and the other racers PEEL OUT -- We PAN UP to reveal the LEMONHEADS watching from a VIP box .
McQueen leads Francesco as they approach Big Bentley .
Here he comes !
Grem turns up the juice to the HIGHEST , DEATH-INDUCING LEVEL .
Holley and Finn watch , helpless .
Mater closes his eyes .
Grem ZAPS MCQUEEN .
McQueen SPEEDS PAST Big Bentley , unharmed .
Oblivious to what was supposed to have just happened .
Zundapp suddenly SQUAWKS over the radio .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
What happened !
?
I do n't know , Professor .
What did you do ?
-LRB- TO ACER . -RRB-
I did n't do nothin ' .
Shh !
I 'm talking to the Professor --
They 're all talking at once and for a moment we can not understand what is being said .
You broke it .
Quiet !
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
I understand , sir .
Yes .
Grem hangs up .
What 'd he say ?
We go to the backup plan .
Backup plan ?
We snuck a bomb in McQueen 's pit !
The next time he makes a stop , instead of saying `` ka-chow , '' he 's gon na go `` ka-boom '' !
They LAUGH .
Mater shudders , upset .
Do n't feel bad , tow truck .
You could n't have saved him .
Oh , wait .
You could have !
Grem and Acer laugh .
As they board the elevator :
Dadgum lemons .
Request acknowledged .
Suddenly , Mater 's GATLING GUNS rotate out again - a surprise to Mater .
But they SPIN IN PLACE , empty .
Grem and Acer just laugh more .
What , you did n't think we 'd take your bullets ?
Mater NOTICES SOMETHING .
CLOSE ON WHAT MATER SEES : A small piece of his ropes have been shaved away by the Gatling .
He carefully rotates his guns BACK IN , pretending like he 's seen nothing .
That 's right !
You got nothin ' .
-LRB- as the elevator descends . -RRB-
Who 's the lemon now , huh ?
They 're GONE .
Nice try , Mater .
Dadgum !
REQUEST ACK
The guns ROTATE OUT AGAIN , SPIN .
Mater watches as the spinning barrels SLICE INTO the ropes , do some damage .
Dadgum !
Dadgum !
Dadgum !
The COMPUTER responds with each `` dadgum . ''
The barrels continue to SPIN , CUTTING THROUGH the ropes .
DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM --
PING !
The ropes BREAK AWAY and Mater FALLS -- right toward the whirring machinery !
Mater !
Mater QUICKLY WHIPS his tow cable around , hooks a pipe and tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy THUD .
He does n't
I got ta get you all out of there !
There 's no time .
McQueen needs your help , Mater .
But I ca n't , I 'm just a tow truck .
It 's up to you .
Go to the pits and get everyone out .
You can do that .
What about you guys ?
We 'll be okay .
Go and get some more dents , Mater .
Mater SPEEDS out the front door , a bat out of hell --
On Finn and Holley , now closer to death .
So we 'll be `` okay '' ?
Really ?
He would n't have left if I 'd told him the truth .
-LRB- re : his death trap . -RRB-
Being killed by a clock .
Gives a whole new meaning to `` your time has come . ''
At this mention Holley seems to perk up , gets an idea .
Time .
That 's it !
She spies a GEARBOX below them , at least 20 feet down .
Holley FIRES HER ELECTROSHOCKERS ----- but they miss their target .
She recoils them back .
What are you doing ?
Trying to turn back time .
If I can just reverse the polarity .
She FIRES them again .
Direct hit !
Holley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE .
The CLOCK STOPS .
It reverses itself .
Finn and Holley 's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger .
Good job !
Quick thinking , Holley !
BIG BENTLEY , visible from street level , now moves BACKWARDS .
Fast .
CRANE DOWN TO ----- Mater , speeding toward the track , unaware .
What 's everybody on the wrong side of the road for ?!
Finn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction , toward ANOTHER GEAR !
And it 's going MUCH FASTER .
They 're seconds from a crushing death .
Oh no !
Drive !
They both DRIVE , fast as they can with FULL FORCE --
Burn rubber !
They drive HARDER , separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES !
Their tires spinning , they both LAUNCH off in opposite directions , LAND HARD on opposing platforms .
As Finn squeals around to Holley 's side of the clock :
We 've got to get to the course .
Calculate the fastest way to --
Holley pops WINGS out of her side .
Done .
-LRB- IMPRESSED . -RRB-
Miss Shiftwell .
They 're standard issue now .
You kids get all the good hardware .
They turn to leave when they STOP , see SOMETHING .
It 's an AIR FILTER on the ground .
Oh no .
That 's Mater 's .
I knew his escape was too easy .
Finn BURSTS out the front doors of Big Bentley , speeds off as HOLLEY SMASHES through the clock face , careens into view flying over the traffic --
Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb , tears through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN 'S .
Mater !
Everybody get out !
Get out now !
Y' all got ta get out the pits !
The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here .
Hey , what are you guys doing here ?
We 're here because of you , Mater .
Is everything okay ?
No !
Everything 's not okay !
There 's a bomb in here !
Y' all got ta get out !
Now !
- A bomb ?
- Huh ?
- Woah .
-LRB- OVER RADIO . -RRB-
Mater !
-LRB- INTO RADIO . -RRB-
Finn !
You 're okay !
Mater , listen to me .
The bomb is on you .
ON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY : We can see that a BOMB has been detected , anchored to Mater 's air filter .
They knew you 'd try to help McQueen .
When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter .
Mater SNORTS , blowing his air filter cover off .
Cross-eyed , Mater sees the explosive device attached to him .
He looks up : An ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head .
Uh-oh .
Mater !
There you are !
Mater turns .
McQueen enters Pit Row , 100 yards away and closing in FAST .
Stop right there !
Oh man , I 've been so worried about you !
The view of this scene through the window of a luxury box .
Reveal Zundapp in the window 's reflection .
He 's watching from inside .
He 's poised to push a DETONATOR BUTTON .
As Zundapp 's front tire approaches the detonator --
Do n't come any closer !
Are you okay ?
No , I 'm not okay .
Stay away from me !
Mater PEELS OUT BACKWARDS , out onto the track .
No , wait .
Wait !
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP - He hesitates , ca n't believe it .
TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Hold everything .
A tow truck has just raced onto the track .
And he 's driving backwards !
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT
Mater , wait !
He breezes right through his pit , goes after Mater .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Normally an emergency vehicle on the track means there 's been an accident .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
Wait , wait .
Lightning McQueen is chasing him !
Mater drives up the track .
McQueen gains , fast .
Because Mater 's going backwards , they 're face-to-face -LRB- but still with some distance between them -RRB- .
Mater , wait !
Stay back !
If you get close to me , you gon na get hurt real bad !
I know I made you feel that way before , but none of that matters because we 're best friends !
TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck !
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
I do n't know who that truck is , Brent .
But I 'll tell you what , he 's got ta be the world 's best backwards driver .
REVEAL ZUNDAPP is watching this footage from his luxury box .
The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire ROLLS onto the detonator .
But he holds back ever so slightly so as not to jump the gun .
ON THE TRACK - McQueen gains on Mater .
McQueen , you do n't get it .
I 'm the bomb !
Yes , Mater !
You are the bomb !
That 's what I 'm trying to say here .
You 've always been the bomb !
And you 'll always be the bomb .
Stay away !
No !
Never !
ON ZUNDAPP .
He watches as McQueen SPEEDS UP .
Almost there .
ON MCQUEEN .
He 's had enough screwing around .
Here he comes .
I 'm not .
letting you .
He 's going to catch him now .
get away again !
McQueen JUMPS FORWARD , in an attempt to grab Mater 's HOOK --
-LRB- TO HIMSELF . -RRB-
Got ta keep away from McQueen .
McQueen hooks Mater with his bumper JUST AS --
Request acknowledged .
TURBINE ROCKETS slide out of Mater .
Oh my gosh !
BAWHOOOOOOM !
Mater JOLTS forward with a rocket blast and disappears , taking McQueen with him .
ON ZUNDAPP .
He now freely PUSHES the detonator , but it says `` OUT OF RANGE . ''
Zundapp ca n't believe it .
He FLIPS OUT .
FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Francesco speeds along .
ZHWAAAAAP !
Mater and McQueen ZING PAST HIM with a RED BLUR .
What is happening ?
It 's a bad dream .
NOW EVEN FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Mater takes a turn , SMASHES THROUGH A FENCE and skids around a corner out of sight .
A white , smoky JET TRAIL is all that remains .
IN MCQUEEN 'S PIT - All of Radiator Springs watches the television monitors , dumbfounded .
-LRB- V.O . -RRB-
And Lightning McQueen just blasted away , hooked to the now rocketpropelled tow truck .
Overhead P.O.V. : Mater and McQueen swerve through the streets .
Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops into view just beyond the glass .
Freaked , Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass window , lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground , and speeds off --
The LEMONHEADS watch , baffled , as Zundapp drives away .
J. CURBY GREMLIN The Professor 's on the run .
Someone 's got ta get McQueen .
Get McQueen !
Grem and Acer are already out the door --
Finn speeds into view , in time to see Zundapp turn a corner out of sight .
Holley .
I 'll get Zundapp , you help Mater .
Holley , still in the air , turns --
Got it !
FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Holley THUNDERS past Francesco and out of sight .
What is happening ?!
Finn screams around a corner , sees ----- Professor Zundapp , speeding toward docks along the Thames where a COMBAT SHIP waits .
Hurry , Professor !
ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast , he accelerates .
Suddenly -- WHAP !
He 's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end .
Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl .
Do you really think I 'm going to let you float away , Professor ?
Finn reels him in .
Zundapp spins his wheels , caught .
Suddenly Zundapp miraculously , inconceivably , GAINS TRACTION !
Now it 's FINN 'S WHEELS that are spinning .
ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on .
He 's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force .
He pulls out a laser , TARGETS it at Finn 's windshield .
Mater , still towing McQueen , rockets around a corner , zips down another street --
McQueen , let go !
Never !
They pass a Gremlin with a headset .
ON GREM AND ACER - Down another side street .
They get this message , take off in the opposite direction .
FINN , tires squealing , loses more and more ground to the boat .
Zundapp , the `` rope '' in this tug-of-war , buckles under the tension .
Give it up , McMissile !
Finn releases a mess of bullets , grenades , and other weaponry into the air -- THE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole -- THUNK !
It all sticks to the magnet , right next to Finn 's bullets .
They 're BOMBS , GRENADES , ROCKETS and one little detonator with a flashing , beeping light .
Off the boat 's RXN -- ANOTHER PART OF LONDON , AT STREET LEVEL KA-BOOOOOOM !
A distant explosion -LRB- miles away -RRB- festoons into the air , visible over the rooftops .
Holley suddenly WINGS into view .
She sees -- Mater and McQueen , speeding up the street .
Mater , stop !
No way !
You could get hurt !
Then she looks over , catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER , bearing down on them from a side street .
They 're going to broadside Mater and McQueen .
Oh no .
ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They 're not aware of the impending impact .
Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY , hits the pavement , SKIDS into the path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM .
They FLIP OVER Holley , Finn and McQueen and sail ----- INTO A PUB ----- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar , knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground .
IN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER Grem and Acer are pulverized by the bar patrons .
Holley , McQueen and Mater are now stopped .
Mater , we 've got to get that bomb off you .
She 's already SCANNING the bomb , working away .
Bomb ?
Yeah , they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan .
Back-up plan ?
Mater , who put a bomb on you ?
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Ahhhhh !
Professor Zundapp suddenly ROLLS to a stop next to -LRB- a now totally freaked -RRB- McQueen , entangled in grappling hooks care OF ----- Finn , who has him leashed .
-LRB- TO MCQUEEN . -RRB-
You .
Why did n't my death ray kill you ?
Death ray ?
Turn off the bomb , Zundapp !
Are you all so dense ?
It 's voiceactivated .
Everything is voiceactivated these days .
Deactivate !
Deactivate !
Voice denied .
The BOMB suddenly TRANSFORMS into a TIME BOMB , now complete with a countdown mechanism from 4:59 .
4:58 .
Mater GASPS .
Oops .
Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it ?
Holley immediately shoves a GUN in Zundapp 's grill .
Say it !
Deactivate .
Voice denied .
THE BOMB 'S TIMER : It loses a full minute !
Goes from 4:48 to 3:48 to 3:47 .
Mater GASPS .
-LRB- GRINNING . -RRB-
I am not the one who activated it .
Would anyone else like to try ?
ZZZZZZATTT !
Holley shocks him unconscious .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
You read my mind .
He was getting on my nerves .
What do we do ?
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
It 's very simple .
VICTOR HUGO blocks the entrance to a side street .
He 's surrounded by Hugo relatives .
You blow up .
The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the Lemonheads and their families .
-LRB- TO MATER . -RRB-
I 'm gon na go out on a limb here .
These are the guys that want me dead , correct ?
It 's nothing personal .
-LRB- to the Lemons . -RRB-
Fellers , listen .
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- CONT 'D . -RRB-
I know what you 're going through .
Everybody 's been laughing at me my whole life too --
McQueen turns to Mater - he was n't expecting that .
The Lemons all eye each other , considering Mater 's words .
-- but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ai n't gon na make you feel better .
Yeah , but it 's worth a shot .
WHOOM !
He 's BROADSIDED by a blast of water from O.S. It 's Red !
He 's sitting outside an underground entrance , followed by Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang .
ALL OUT WAR ensues between the LEMONS , RADIATOR SPRINGS along with FINN and HOLLEY .
FINN attaches his four-way cable hooks to the thugs and springs high in the air , crushing the four of them together .
HOLLEY SPROUTS her wings , and knocks out two cars on her side .
Guido pulls some LEMON tires off with his air gun .
In seconds he has a stack of lugnuts next to him .
Pit stop .
The two Pacers ' tires all FALL OFF .
Flo hits VLADIMIR TRUNKOV with her high-beams , BLINDING HIM .
Sheriff BOOTS him .
Not today , boys !
Guido pushes away his tireless thug , YELLING AT HIM IN ITALIAN .
Mater KARATE CHOPS lemons , three and four at a time .
Ramone SPRAY PAINTS a lemon 's windshield .
Retreat !
A few Lemons turn back the way they came .
BLOCKING THEIR PATH are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo , led by SARGE .
Thanks for the help , Corporal .
Anything for one of pop 's mates .
And in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO ----- MATER .
WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off .
No dice .
Guido gestures wildly , spits Italian a mile a minute .
What 's he saying ?!
What 's wrong !
?
None of his wrenches fit the bolts !
This is a light bulb moment for Mater .
He eyes the bolts .
I get it .
I get it !
I know what needs to be done .
Then do it !
What ?
No , I ca n't do it .
Look , nobody takes me seriously .
I know that now .
This ai n't Radiator Springs .
Yes it is .
Mater looks at McQueen .
It is ?
You 're yourself in Radiator Springs .
Be yourself here .
And if people are n't taking you seriously , then they need to change .
Not you .
I know that , because I was wrong before .
Now you can do this .
You 're the bomb .
Thanks , buddy .
No no no , you 're the actual bomb .
Now let 's go !
Oh , right !
Hang on !
Mater HOOKS McQueen and they 're off .
They SHOOT PAST FINN , who 's in the middle of battling lemons .
Where 's he going ?
ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street .
Computer !
Yes , Agent Mater .
I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen !
Request acknowledged .
The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in .
They head right for a WALL .
Mater .
Now I need you to do the chute , the second kind not the first !
Deploying chute .
Mater 's chute POPS OPEN , catching air and sending Mater and McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR .
Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants .
He and McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON .
The QUEEN , her attendants , assorted dignitaries are here .
Who 's winning the race ?
Mater and McQueen drop from the sky .
They land and skid to a halt just before the Queen 's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS .
Back up !
Back away !
-LRB- STAR-STRUCK . -RRB-
It 's Lightning McQueen !
Get back !
No , no , it 's okay !
Tell them , Mater .
Explain .
Okay !
Somebody 's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who .
Oh wait .
Your Majesty .
Mater BOWS to the Queen .
In doing so , the TICKING TIME BOMB angles into view .
The clock 's at T-minus 1:53 .
- Bomb !
- It 's a bomb !
- Everybody down !
- Look out !
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Hold your fire !
He ca n't disarm it !
Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and Mater .
Mater , I do n't know what you 're doing but stand down now !
-LRB- aside , to McQueen . -RRB-
This ai n't nothing at all like Radiator Springs .
Mater , just cut to the chase !
Okay .
He turns to Miles Axlerod .
It 's him .
What ?
Me ?
You 've got to be crazy .
Everyone exchanges confused looks , including Finn and Holley .
I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts .
The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph .
Holley !
Show that picture .
O-kay .
Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE .
And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - `` If there ai n't no oil under ` em , there ai n't no oil in ` em . ''
What is he talking about ?
It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan .
You just blamed it on me .
Electric cars do n't use oil , you twit .
Then you 're faking it .
You did n't convert to no electric .
We pop that hood we gon na see that engine from that picture right there .
Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood .
This lorry 's crazy .
He 's going to kill us all !
Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage .
Stay away !
But Sir Axlerod created the race , Mater .
Why would he want to hurt anyone ?
To make Allinol look bad so everybody 'd go back to using oil .
I mean , he said it himself with that disguised voice .
`` Dee-sguised voice ? ''
What are you talking about ?
You 're nuts , you are !
The QUEEN 'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH .
As has the PRINCE .
This is going nowhere fast .
We really should go , Grandmother .
One moment .
I 'd like to see where this is going .
Mater , he created Allinol .
Yeah , but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else ?
Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod 's grill .
What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad ?
`` What if ? ''
You 're basing this on a `` What if '' ?!
Okay , that 's it .
And the QUEEN 'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam out of there FAST --
Wait !
Somebody save me !
The lorry 's crazy !
Now it 's just Miles Axlerod , Mater , McQueen , Finn and Holley .
Miles Axlerod 's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as he is cornered by Mater .
Keep away , you idiot !
00:00:08 .
Mater !
Mater !
00:03 .
00:02 .
Someone do something !
Everyone FLINCHES , DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen , Mater and Axlerod --
You 're insane , you are !
Deactivate !
The bomb FREEZES at 00:01 .
Bomb deactivated .
Have a nice day , Sir Axlerod .
General shock all around .
Miles Axlerod realizes what he 's done , looks terrified .
Police surround him .
Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod 's hood open with his hook , revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE , oil dripping from all sides .
It MATCHES the photo .
The engine from the photo .
It 's a perfect match !
How did the tow truck figure it out ?
-LRB- TO MATER . -RRB-
It 's official .
You 're coming to all my races from now on .
Now you 're talking !
Tire bump .
A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks .
Mater does the requisite `` silly faces '' in an attempt to break the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard .
It is n't working .
McQueen approaches .
Mater , let 's go .
You 're on .
The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main Ballroom .
As Mater and McQueen approach :
Your Majesty .
May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm .
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs .
Go get ` em , buddy .
McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs .
Mater rolls forward .
He bows , as if he 's practiced it all day .
I hereby dub thee `` Sir Tow Mater . ''
Applause from all around .
-LRB- LOOKS UP . -RRB-
`` Sir ? ''
Shoot , you can just call me Mater , Your Majesty .
I do n't wan na hear none of this `` Sir '' business .
By the way , have y' all met each other ?
Queen ?
McQueen .
McQueen , Queen .
McQueen ?
McMissile .
-LRB- MORE . -RRB-
-LRB- CONT 'D . -RRB-
McMissile , McQueen .
Queen ?
McMissile .
He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO --
The town sign now reads `` WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER . ''
Cars surround Mater and McQueen .
The rest of the Radiator Springs gang is here too , watches .
VAN and MINNY are front and center .
So there I was : rocket jets going full blast , McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere , guns drawed .
We was goners .
But then out of nowhere , this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us !
That 's a very entertaining story , young man .
Oh , Minny , please .
Come on , none of this happened .
Rocket jets ?
Flying spy cars ?
No , you 're quite right .
It does sound a bit far-fetched .
The crowd turns , sees HOLLEY , wings out , swooping in .
FINN is right below her , driving up the street .
Holley !
Finn !
Hello , Mater .
It 's so nice to see you again .
What 're you doing here ?
Our satellites picked up an urgent communique .
So you got my e-mail .
Oh , man .
Y' all is gon na have a great time .
Everybody !
This here 's Finn McMissile .
He 's a secret agent .
-LRB- WHISPERS . -RRB-
Do n't tell nobody .
And this is Holley Shiftwell .
She 's --
I 'm Mater 's girlfriend .
It 's so nice to meet you all .
Everyone is shocked .
Including Mater .
Guido 's jaw drops .
-LRB- TO MATER . -RRB-
Guido believe you now .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
Whoa , honey .
You got a nasty dent there .
Indeed , Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater from Grem and Acer .
-LRB- already crushing on her . -RRB-
Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London ?
Van !
What ?
I 'm just asking .
-LRB- TO HOLLEY . -RRB-
Do n't you worry , sweet pea .
My baby Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time .
Yeah , sure thing .
No problemo .
Just let me go get my tools .
Oh no no .
I 'm keeping that dent .
It 's way too valuable .
Mater takes this in .
A `` valuable '' dent ?
Oh , she 's as crazy as Mater .
Those two are perfect for each other .
You know , there 's one thing I still do n't get .
The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera , right ?
So why did n't I , you know .
Explode in a fiery inferno ?
Yeah .
We could n't figure that one out either .
Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline .
And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode .
Wait a second .
Fillmore , you said my fuel was safe .
McQueen turns to Fillmore .
Everyone does .
If you 're implying that I switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my allnatural , sustainable , organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod , you 're dead wrong , man .
-LRB- RE : SARGE . -RRB-
It was him .
Once Big Oil , always Big Oil .
Man .
Tree hugger .
A banner says `` Radiator Springs Grand Prix . ''
SHERIFF rolls up the street .
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin !
All spectators clear the starting line !
MCQUEEN heads up Main Street , other racers following .
Man , I ca n't wait to get rockin ' .
This is gon na be wicked .
Yeah , we should do this every year .
I just figured , we never found out who the world 's fastest car is .
Plus : no press , no trophy .
Just racing - the way I like it .
Francesco likes it like this too .
McQueen SEES Sally .
He and Francesco approach her .
Francesco .
I 'd like you to meet --
Signorina Sally .
It is official : Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world .
-LRB- SWOONING . -RRB-
Why , thank you --
Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today .
Francesco turns to leave .
As he 's moving away :
See you at the finish line , Mc --
Francesco STOPS .
What is that ?
McQueen has a new bumper sticker : `` Ka-ciao , Francesco . ''
It 's just something I had made up for the occasion .
Is good , McQueen .
Very funny .
It was funnier when I did it , but it 's very funny .
What are you going to do next ?
Are you going to take off your fenders ?
Try it .
You 'll like it .
Francesco leaves .
We stay with McQueen and Sally .
So he 's not so good-looking .
Yeah .
Nice try .
I 'm serious .
That 's why I love you , Sally .
-LRB- as he leaves . -RRB-
Wish me luck .
You do n't need it !
He drives off .
Flo approaches Sally .
Mmm-mmm .
That Francesco is finelooking .
And those open wheels .
I 'm gon na have to go get myself some coolant .
The racers at the starting grid .
ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT in the center of town .
It goes from RED to GREEN !
The RACERS SPEED OFF , tearing up main street and out of town , blazing past tourists --
As the racers , led by McQueen and Francesco , take the wide , sweeping turn around Willy 's Butte we CRANE UP to see MATER , FINN , HOLLEY , and the Radiator Springs gang watching .
Everyone CHEERS .
Go McQueen !
Whoo-hoo !
Holley gets an alert .
Finn , time to go .
Siddeley 's gassed , geared and ready to fly .
Finn starts to back up .
You 're leaving already ?
We 've got another mission , Mater .
Just stopped by here to `` pick something up . ''
They both eye Mater , expectantly .
Something tells me you 're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers .
Her Majesty asked for you personally , Mater .
But I told you all before .
I 'm not a spy .
We know .
Spy or not , you 're still the smartest , most honest chap we 've ever met .
Do n't forget massively charming .
Mater looks over at Holley .
He looks touched .
Well , thanks .
But as much fun as it was hanging with y' all , this .
He looks over to his friends who watch the race , CHEER MCQUEEN ON .
This is home .
That 's alright , we understand .
But I 'll be back .
You still owe me that first date .
If there 's ever anything I can do for you , just let me know .
Well , I sure appreciate that , thank you .
-LRB- THINKS . -RRB-
Actually .
there is one thing .
MATER , blazing forward fast .
Whoo-hoo !
He ROCKETS FORWARD , through the whole town .
In doing so he GRABS A BROKEN DOWN OTIS , hooking him --
Whoa !
-- and TOSSING him right into Ramone 's .
-LRB- O.S . -RRB-
Thanks , Mater !
ON THE `` RACE TRACK '' - Mater flies past ALL the racers , including Francesco --
Impossible !
-- until he approaches MCQUEEN .
Mater !
?
-LRB- KEEPING PACE . -RRB-
Check it out .
They let me keep the rockets !
I 'll see you at the finish line , buddy !
Not if I see you first !
McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers , lead them off the road and into the dirt for another lap .
The two friends are side by side when we FADE OUT .
THE END
