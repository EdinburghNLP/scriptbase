INT. BLACK SCREEN

		MORRISON'S VOICE
	The movie will begin in five moments 
	The mindless voice announced 
	All those unseated will await the 
	next show 
	We filed slowly, languidly into the 
	hall 
	The auditorium was fast and silent 
	As we seated and were darkened 
	The voice continued 
	"The program for this evening is not 
	new 
	You've seen this entertainment 
	Through and through 
	You've seen your birth, your life 
	and death 
	You might recall all the rest 
	Did you have a good world when you 
	died? 
	Enough to base a movie on?"

FADE IN:

INT. RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 - NIGHT

A dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker-like studio. 
MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano...

The ENGINEER waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored, 
fiddling...

		ENGINEER
	Hey Jim, It's your birthday man, 
	whaddaya say we try this another 
	night...

Camera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the 
sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair; 
moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with 
verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of Irish 
Bushmill's whiskey.

		VOICE
		(off)
	Kill the lights a little more, will 
	ya John?

They might drop a bit more... Camera crawling past the FINGERS 
weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack. An ashtray 
full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with 
phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey 
with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot -- 
an American Indian in full headdress.

		ENGINEER
		(off)
	Hey man, how come the Doors aren't 
	in on this?

Camera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON, -- 27, poet, buried 
in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted 
sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long 
greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and 
struggling for survival through his words... beneath the 
Bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently 
in our face

		JIM
	No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is 
	everybody in?... Is Everybody in?... 
	Is everybody in? The ceremony is 
	about to begin...

He shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his sudden 
giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio.

		JIM
	WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!!

Music riffs from "American Prayer". AUDIENCE SOUNDS ghostly 
on the track. The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the sudden 
shift in sound, cursing silent.

		JIM VOICE
	Let me tell you about the heartache 
	and the loss of God Wandering 
	wandering in hopeless night Indian's 
	scattered on dawn's highway bleeding 
	ghosts crowd the young childs fragile 
	eggshell mind...
		(wind sounds)

The GRIN on Jim's face magnesium flares out to:

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940'S)

The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it 
stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow-
orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with 
ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the 
MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock -- 
the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM.

DOORS SONG 
Riders on the storm (2) 
Into this house we're born 
Into this world we're thrown 
Like a dog without a bone 
An actor out on loan 
Riders on the storm

CREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE

		JIM VOICE
		(continues over imagery)
	...me and my mother and father and 
	grandmother and grandfather were 
	driving through the desert at dawn 
	and a truckload of Indian workers 
	had either hit another car or just -- 
	I don't know what happened... Indians 
	were scattered all over the highway 
	bleeding to death.

INT. CAR - DAY

MOM, DAD, the youngest BABY in the front seat -- pointing at 
the storm.

GRANDMA &amp; GRANDAD in the back with JIM, about 4 and his 
SISTER, 3 asleep.

Mom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man in 
civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a 
desert storm... but we barely hear

A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound, 
frightening dawn of creation...

Grandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open --

Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing

An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded 
INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible 
accident...

The first thing Jim sees...

An old INDIAN FACE staring at him...

The car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down... 
asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIAN 
WOMEN, CHILDREN

Mom's scared face...

		JIM VOICE
	...but it was the first time I tasted 
	fear. I musta been about four, like 
	a child is just like a flower, his 
	head is floating in the breeze.

Grandma trying to hide Jim's face but he looks back...

THE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH

The kid looking back through the rear window, terrified -- 
his first view of death. The bodies, the sense of doom 
overlaying the land -- a child's worst nightmare.

		MOM
	It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a 
	dream

SONG 
(continues) 
There's a killer on the road 
His brain is squirming like a toad 
Take a long holiday 
Let your children play 
If you give this man a ride 
Sweet family will die 
There's a killer on the road

The boy's eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at him... 
then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the 
asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing 
eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim

		MOM
	It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream

A strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient gourd, 
"shi-chi-chi, shi-chi-chi". Something flying through the 
air. A bull-roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the 
appearance of a shaman.

INTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding point 
of view -- the Indians, the overturned truck...

		JIM VOICE
	...The reaction I get now looking 
	back is the soul of the ghosts of 
	those dead Indians -- maybe one or 
	two of them were just running around 
	freaking out and just leaped into my 
	soul -- and they're still there.
		(wind, music)

SONG 
Girl you gotta love your man (2) 
Take him by the hand 
Make him understand

The car pulling away across the giant 1940's landscape

									DISSOLVING TO:

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1963)

SUBTITLE READS: ARIZONA DESERT, 1963. CREDITS CONTINUE TO 
ROLL.

Panning up the black chino pants to JIM MORRISON, now 20, 
steel seaman's suitcase in hand, thumbing a ride, the road 
sign behind him saying "Los angeles 370 miles"

SONG 
The world on you depends 
Our life will never end 
Girl you gotta love your man

A LARGE LIZARD in the dust cocks its head, blinks, as the 
boots walk by to the car pulling over.

INT. CAR

JIM in the backseat packed with HUSBAND, WIFE, CHILDREN, 
DOG, MOTHER-IN-LAW. Between boy and man, eyes ancient and 
new. He wears his favorite color: black -- torn black chinos, 
paint-spotted black t-shirt, a slouch his favorite pose but 
the eyes and smile can be warm and shy like a little boy, 
gentle surface, storm in the brain.

The HUSBAND, now looking at Jim a little nervously, pushes 
up the Perry Como on the radio... as it cuts to a sudden 
news flash:

		RADIO
	...from the Texas School Book 
	Depository. We repeat. President 
	John F. Kennedy was shot a few minutes 
	ago in Dallas!

SLOW MOTION: The Husband's face distorting, saying something 
on the track like: "What! God NO!" but it's subdued, low. 
Trying other stations.

Jim turns to look out his window, as if he already knew.

		RADIO
		(2nd VOICE)
	...taken to Parkland Memorial 
	Hospital. There's no word on the 
	President's condition. Mrs. Kennedy 
	is...

The WIFE'S and HUSBAND'S VOICES seem lost in the background.

		WIFE &amp; HUSBAND
	Oh God, Oh God. Not the President 
	for Christ's sake. Oh God -- WHO'S 
	NEXT?

On Jim -- staring out the window. "Who's next!"

SONG 
Riders on the storm (4)

On the DESERT.

										DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - LOS ANGELES - DAY (1965)

SUBTITLE READS: VENICE, CALIFORNIA 1965

CREDITS continue to their conclusion as we segue into the 
BLUENESS of VENICE, CALIFORNIA, 1965 -- the dawn of a new 
age. All was possible.

Individual SHOTS of the BOARDWALK throbbing with a feast of 
HIPPIES, head shops, ARTISTS drawing psychedelic murals, POT 
SMOKERS, MUSCLE BUILDERS, tambourines accompanying the 
transister radios on the Beach Boys and "I Got You Babe", 
dogs chasing frisbees, BIKINI BODIES on the beach, LSD sold 
over the counter... set to the upbeat chords of HELLO I LOVE 
YOU

DOORS SONG 
Hello I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello I love you 
Let me jump in your game 
She's walking down the street 
Blind to every eye she meets 
Do you think you'll be the guy 
To make the queen of the angels sigh?

JIM, in torn black chinos, no shirt, walking real slow past 
it all, carrying a notebook of his own and a paperback of 
Baudelaire, his eyes settling on...

A YOUNG BEAUTY and her yellow labrador -- a fashionable thin, 
long, red-haired "20th century fox" in jeans moving through 
the crowd...

He thinks about it -- a fraction of eternity -- and he's 
off... after her.

EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

She moves along its banks, as if the universe moved to her 
rhythm, turning once to look back. Jim caught in her eyes. 
They're alone. Now he's the one seized by doubt. He slows, 
pretends to take another interest.

DOORS SONG 
She holds her head so high 
Like a statue in the sky 
Her arms are wicked 
And her legs are long 
When she moves 
My brain screams out this song

EXT. VENICE CANAL - ANOTHER CANAL - DAY

As she turns into another street, he resumes following her. 
She gets to a house, goes in. There's a group of people 
partying. He stops, watches.

DOORS SONG 
Sidewalk crouches at her feet 
Like a dog that begs for something sweet 
Do you hope to make her see you, fool? 
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

EXT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT EVENING

The two story house has a quaint run-down charm. Friends 
have dropped by, people smoking joints, beers.

She's on the upstairs balcony -- talking with a YOUNG MAN 
(professor type) in his 30's, who passes her a joint.

JIM lurks in the shadows of the trees; he's been standing 
outside watching... The MUSIC shifts to the quieter LOVE 
STREET.

DOORS SONG 
She lives on Love Street 
Lingers long on Love Street 
She has a house and garden 
I would like to see what happens

The YOUNG MAN gestures, and goes back inside the house. She's 
alone now on the balcony, sitting on a kitchen table...

It's now or never. Jim scales the tree alongside the house 
with the agility of a gymnast.

DOORS SONG 
She has robes and she has monkeys 
Lazy diamond studded flunkies 
She has wisdom and knows what to do 
She has me and she has you

The girl's grinding up pot in an old shoebox with a spoon 
and kitchen strainer. She looks up and sees his crotch three 
feet from her face, balanced there effortlessly on the railing 
like a highwire act, opens her mouth in surprise.

Jim drops softly to the balcony, a smile of disarming 
gentleness.

		JIM
	Hi...

		GIRL
	Wow! Hi...
		(looking at the tree)
	You have a problem with doors?

		JIM
	Waste of time...

His head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder, he drawls, 
southern gentleman, polite, slow, thoughtful as if he had 
all the time in the world, as if the guy would never come 
back.

		JIM
	I followed you... from the beach...

		GIRL
		(impressed)
	Wow! You followed me? Why?

		JIM
	...cause... you're the one...

He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips.

		GIRL
		(mesmerized, awkward)
	Wow... neat...
		(looks back)
	...maybe you should meet my old man?

		JIM
	Later. You got a name?

He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big 
round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his 
intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time.

The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees 
him.

As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree -- 
looks back once.

		JIM
	Mine's Jim.

A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot.

		GIRL
	Pam...

The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles.

		JIM
	Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim...

He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a 
vision.

		YOUNG MAN
	Who the hell was that?

		PAMELA
		(everything's cool)
	That's Jim. My new friend.

INT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965)

On the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a 
stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in 
black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of 
goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds 
of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track, 
an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the 
track as well.

		JIM'S VOICE
	Nietzche said "all great things must 
	first wear monstrous and terrifying 
	masks in order to inscribe themselves 
	on the hearts of humanity". Listen 
	children -- to the sound of the 
	Nuremberg night.

STUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving 
to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at 
the screen.

A CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the 
lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks.

		JIM VOICE
		(on screen)
	Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala. 
	A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. 
	Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. 
	Voices. Touched? An animal. Your 
	hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water 
	and wine

		STUDENTS
		(ad lib)
	SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon!

RAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, 
thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans 
over to Jim.

		RAY
	Hey man it's great, don't listen to 
	em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry 
	man, everything Godard stands for.

The lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker 
off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of 
the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater.

A youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of 
upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize.

		INSTRUCTOR
	This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. 
	Morrison. And I might say indulgent. 
	Naziism and masturbation, when used 
	for shock value, are not art. But to 
	be constructive, let's start with 
	your intention. What was it?

		STUDENT 1
	It was a bore!! That's what!
		(laughter)

TRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim, 
shoot their hands up.

		TRICK
	Hey it was better'n a Warhol picture.

		GIRL 1
	No it wasn't. It was worse!

		TRICK
	A guy sleeping for seven hours...

		STUDENT 2
	...is less pretentious! There was no 
	political consciousness. Naziism 
	is...

		JACK
	Hey hold on man! You guys are the 
	facists!

		BONES
	It takes genitalism to absurdity 
	man, just cause the squares here 
	can't dig it cause the film school's 
	still so square...

		VOICES
	Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo! 
	Beatniks go home! Take another 
	mushroom...

A cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's 
quiet eyes.

		INSTRUCTOR
	HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison -- 
	what are your feelings?

		JIM
	I quit.
		(walks out)

EXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA" 
blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely 
college crowd circa '65.

		TRICK
		(to Jim)
	Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar?

		BONES
	You can't quit, you gotta voice. 
	People can't dig cause they don't 
	understand yet.

		JACK
	If you're an individual, if you're 
	too good, they wanna cut your dick 
	off. Look what happened to Orson 
	Wells.

		TRICK
	You quit now, they'll yank your 
	deferment in no time and they'll get 
	you for Vietnam man. Three more months 
	you graduate.

		BONES
	Be cool, you never learned fuckin 
	patience Morrison, you want everything 
	at once.

		NICK
	They didn't get it. So make your 
	films and fuck what they think.

		JIM
	You know what I think?

He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls.

		BONES
	Yeah whadday you think?

		JIM
	You really want to know what I think?

The cronies wait, anticipating something inescapably evil to 
escape his lips.

		BONES
	Yeah yeah, whatddaya think?

		JIM
	I think we gotta get really ripped!

INT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

Tall bespectacled RAY MANZAREK is banging out GLORIA on the 
piano in bad Jerry Lee Lewis style.

		RAY
	I tell you bout my baby 'bout five 
	foot four from head to toe She came 
	to my room Just 'bout midnight She 
	makes me feel so good She makes me 
	feel alright

Camera moving to reveal JOHN DENSMORE wiry, solid on the 
drums... moving on to ROBBIE KRIEGER, wispy, ethereal looking, 
the youngest, flamenco-type moves on his early electric 
guitar. Also a HARMONICA PLAYER and a BASE. They all seem 
slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback 
or Ray's warbling, but the crowd couldn't care less -- a 
German beerhall, they want noise and sex.

JIM and his GANG, beers in hand, mouth back the words, beers 
everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling, everyone on their 
feet, nuts with spring fever. Jim eyeing the GIRL next to 
him.

		JIM
	You know what I'd like to do to you?

		GIRL
		(waiting, intrigued)
	No what?

		JIM
	You really want to know what I'd 
	like to do to you?

		GIRL
	What!

The FOOTBALL TEAM TYPES edge over nearby, one of them picking 
out Jim with a glare.

		JIM
		(whispering)
	Wanna hear the scream of the 
	butterfly...

She looks puzzled by the suggestion.

		FOOTBALL PLAYER
	Hey Morrison!

		JIM
		(eluding the man)
	Can we have a couple of beers. You're 
	not even an asshole man -- you're a 
	semihole.

He evades the football man's grasp, elusive physicality. He 
hops over tables, heading for the stage. Other KIDS are up 
on the stage dancing, but Jim goes right up alongside RAY, 
shaking his hips like Elvis. Ray giving him the mike. Improv 
time.

		JIM
		(singing)
	She came to my room 
	She came on my floor 
	She came on my bed 
	She came on my face 
	Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs 
	around my head baby baby and her 
	name was Gloria

They love it. The place going wild. The girl with the football 
player wanting him.

INT. RAY'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT

JIM is insane on beers in the back seat, reaching over the 
wheel to try to drive the car for RAY who is flailing at 
him. Jim pulling Ray's hair...

		JIM
		(barely comprehensible)
	HA HA HA HA HA! COME ON, LET'S DRIVE 
	TO MEXICO MAN. TIJUANA. LET'S GET 
	LOST!

Jammed into the sedan are TRICK, BONES, ROBBIE, JOHN...

		RAY &amp; ALL
	COOL IT JIM, COME ON COOL IT.

		JIM
	FREEDOM!!! DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL 
	SLAVES!

As he winds down the window and starts crawling out of the 
car. Heavy traffic. Ray weaving to avoid another vehicle. 
Honking horn.

		JOHN
	HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GOING OUT!

		TRICK
	HE'S GONNA JUMP!

		RAY
	GET HIM BACK IN!

His waist is out the window, John and all grabbing for his 
heels.

EXT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT

SPECIAL EFFECT: JIM's head six inches from pavement moving 
at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a 
maniac. Beeping horns all over the place.

		JIM
	DEATH OLD FRIEND!!

In the car, madness, raging chaos, the four boys pulling him 
in.

EXT./INT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT NIGHT

Night. Shadows. A tree. A figure moving.

JIM 
(SONG) 
Awake! 
Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet one 
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day 
The day's divinity the first thing you see

Jim slides her upstairs' door open, crawls in next to her 
bed. She's asleep with her boyfriend. He touches her toe. 
She awakes, startled.

		JIM
	Come on, come out for a walk, it's a 
	pretty night.

		PAM
	You're crazy!

EXT. VENICE CANALS - NIGHT

JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways. A clear starry 
California night.

JIM 
(SONG) 
A vast radiant beach 
And a cool jewelled moon 
Couples naked, race down by its quiet side 
And we laugh like soft mad children

There's a crash. They turn bristling.

A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp, pulling 
its head from an overstuffed garbage can, looking back at 
them.

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Fires on the boardwalk. Hippies, Bums, Older People. JIM and 
PAM move through talking, skipping, touching like children.

JIM 
(SONG) 
...smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy 
The music and voices are all around us 
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones 
The time has come again

EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT

The two of them race down by its side, slowing to a walk. 
His [...] loved orphan voice.

		JIM
	Can I stay with you tonight? We could 
	talk 'till dawn. I just don't want 
	to be alone.

		PAM
		(hesitant)
	Okay... just talk though. No funny 
	stuff.

		JIM
	Okay. I promise.

		PAM
	I've been real upset. I lost my car 
	on the freeway yesterday. I left it 
	somewhere and I can't remember where 
	and when I went back it was gone. My 
	sister...

		JIM
	I bet you never expected life could 
	be this hard.
		(strokes her hair 
		affectionately)
	And you're still so young.

She breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her.

		JIM
	I wonder where we'll be ten years 
	from now?

		PAM
	I really don't want to know

		JIM
	Come on.

JIM 
(SONG) 
Choose now, they croon 
Beneath the moon 
Beside an ancient lake 
Enter again the sweet forest 
Enter the hot dream 
Come with us 
Everything is broken up and dances

EXT. VENICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Their silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old 
structure overlooking the boardwalk.

EXT. VENICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his 
sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking 
moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television 
antennas. Fires burn from the beach.

In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we 
see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic 
William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere -- 
panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud, 
mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen 
ideas.

		PAM
		(reading, looking)
	These are like beautiful! I never 
	read much poetry in school. I hated 
	it. What's a "shaman"?
		(mispronounces)

		JIM
	He's the medicine man who starts in 
	a peyote trance. And he gets everyone 
	in the tribe going and they share in 
	his vision and it heals them. It's 
	the same in all cultures -- Greeks, 
	Jesus. Some Indians say the first 
	shaman invented sex. He's the one 
	who makes you crazy.

		PAM
	Are you a "shaman"?

		JIM
	Uh
		(pause)
	no. I just write about it. What turns 
	you on?

		PAM
	I don't know. Experience. Freedom. 
	Love... Now. Peyote's like love. 
	When it's given it's blessed. When 
	it's sold it's damned. I like peyote. 
	I like acid, it's easier to get. I 
	like the spiritual voyage. The first 
	time I did acid I saw God. I did. I 
	had a friend who was Christ. And he 
	was Judas too. I suddenly knew the 
	secret of everything -- that we're 
	all one, the universe is one. And 
	that everything is beautiful.

		JIM
	Is it? I don't know. I think you're 
	alive by confronting death -- by 
	experiencing pain.

		PAM
	I think you're alive by recognizing 
	beauty -- seeing truth because when 
	you discover truth you discover what 
	love is... we're all saying the same 
	thing. It's "love me and I'll love 
	you."

		JIM
		(looks at her, ironic)
	It's only thru death that you know 
	life. Jesus, medicine men heal people 
	by sacrificing their own life.

		PAM
	Do you love Death?

		JIM
	I think life hurts a lot more than 
	death. When you die the pain is over.

Pam shivers, a strange thought.

		PAM
	Why do I look at you... and see my 
	death?
		(pause, shrugs)
	No, that's ridiculous.

		JIM
	I bet your dad's a school teacher.

		PAM
	How did you know!

		JIM
	I don't know.

		PAM
	What was your father?

		JIM
	Military

		PAM
	I bet you moved around a lot.

		JIM
	Yeah, about 8 times.

		PAM
	How many sisters and brothers?

		JIM
	Two.

		PAM
	One... she's the pretty one... I 
	love your neck.
		(she gets in his lap)

He runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently.

		JIM
	"...but one, the most beautiful one 
	of all dances in a ring of fire and 
	throws off the challenge with a shrug"

		PAM
	That's beautiful. Who did you write 
	it for?

		JIM
	I wrote it for you.

The panties coming off. Rousseau dangling from the Venice 
moon. He moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward 
than we might expect.

		PAM
	...take your time, Jim... there's no 
	hurry, I'm all you have to do 
	tonight...

DOORS SONG 
Well the clock says it's time to close now 
I guess I'd better go now... 
As we depart the rooftop. 
Your fingers weak with minarets 
Speaking secret alphabets 
I light another cigarette 
Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget

										DISSOLVE TO:

Possibly we hear the soft backbeat of MOONLIGHT DRIVE without 
lyrics.

RAY MANZAREK is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as 
well, in his post-graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie 
shirt. But the meditation is not going well. He's shaking 
his head at himself, frowning.

		RAY
	Om om... No bliss! No bliss!

Jim has approached closer, amused, looking down.

		JIM
	Hey Ray, try acid man, it's 
	guaranteed.

Ray opening his eyes -- his POV -- Jim, slouched, jacket 
over his shoulder, sun behind him.

		RAY
		(surprised)
	Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I 
	thought I was going through hell's 
	digestive system. Something painted 
	by Hieronymus Bosch.

		JIM
	I never had a bummer on acid.

		RAY
	I like naturally high man.

		JIM
	Whatever works. Making movies at MGM 
	yet?

		RAY
	Well I saw the head of production 
	and I said Godard doesn't use scripts, 
	he improvises with his camera and he 
	said, "great who's Godard?"

		JIM
		(laughs)
	We gotta take the planet back, 
	reinvent the Gods, make new myths.

		RAY
	Right on. I thought you went to New 
	York?

		JIM
	Never got there. Went out to the 
	desert and uh... got lost y'know. 
	Days. I been living on Trick's 
	rooftop. Got stuck on this chick...

		RAY
	Whatcha been doing?

		JIM
	Writing. Poems. Songs.

		RAY
	Songs? Lemme hear one.

		JIM
	I can't sing.

		RAY
	So neither can Dylan. "Johnny's in 
	the basement mixing up the medicine, 
	I'm on the pavement thinking about 
	the government". But he's got the 
	words man. That's what they want.

		JIM
		(suddenly sings)
	Let's swim to the moon un hunh 
	Let's climb thru the tide 
	Penetrate the evening 
	That the city sleeps to hide

Jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. As the grains 
spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed.

Ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. All of a sudden 
we're in RAY'S POV -- a mystical moment. Jim singing, no 
sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.

		JIM
	Let's swim out tonight love 
	It's our turn to try 
	Parked beside the ocean 
	On our moonlight drive

Jim stops, shrugs. Ray looks at him a long beat. Intense 
eyes, the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot 
be stopped.

		RAY
	Wow!... Y'know man those are hot 
	lyrics -- really hot!

		JIM
		(pleased)
	...could you write the music for 
	that down, if we went over to your 
	place, could you write that on your 
	organ?

		RAY
	Are you kidding! I could fly. You 
	wrote that? You got others?

		JIM
	A bunch. It's like I'm taking notes 
	at a rock concert going on inside my 
	head. I actually hear the music -- 
	the spirit of the wine y'know, 
	intoxication.

		RAY
		(slaps him on the 
		knee)
	Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker -- 
	haunted! What the hell happened to 
	you in the desert? Let's get a rock 
	and roll band together man and make 
	a million bucks.

		JIM
	...be great wouldn't it?

		RAY
		(walking JIM)
	It's the perfect time man! Two of 
	the guys outta my band are really 
	into this. I meditate with them. You 
	know them... Robbie and John. We 
	could have it in the can in three 
	weeks.

		JIM
	Hey why not, I could write the songs 
	with you guys.

		RAY
	The Stones did it outta the London 
	School of Economics for Chrissake. 
	Things are about to explode man. You 
	can feel it in the air.
		(points out over the 
		ocean)
	Vietnam's right out there. Sides are 
	being chosen. People wanna fight or 
	fuck, love or kill, everything's 
	gonna flame. The planet's screaming 
	for change, Morrison. Make the myths 
	man!!

Jim laughs, loves Ray's ardor as they move along the ocean 
side.

		JIM
	There oughta be great orgies man. 
	Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece, 
	he made all the women mad, leaving 
	their homes and dancing off in the 
	mountains. Great golden copulations 
	in the streets of LA.
		(looks at a passing 
		girl)
	Hey, do you know her?

		RAY
	What do we call ourselves. "Dionysus"?

		JIM
	I got a name.

		RAY
	What?

		JIM
	The Doors.

		RAY
	The Doors?
		(facial distaste)
	That's the most ridiculous...
		(then)
	...you mean the doors in your mind? 
	Like the Huxley book.

		JIM
	"The Doors of Perception"? Acid...

		RAY
	Yeah sure mescaline experiments -- 
	reducing the sugar flow to the brain. 
	Great book.

		JIM
	It's from William Blake actually, 
	the line -- "when the doors of 
	perception are cleansed -- things 
	will appear as they truly are..."

		RAY
		(finishes)
	-- infinite". It's great, Jim.

		JIM
	So where do we start? How do we start? 
	Where are the girls?

		RAY
	Rehearsing. You're moving off the 
	rooftop and in with me and Dorothy.

As they walk off, the two of them along the edge of the 
Pacific. A dog jumping for a frisbee. The music of MOONLIGHT 
DRIVE now riffs over the real song now.

DOORS SONG 
Let's swim to the moon 
Let's climb thru the tide 
Penetrate the evening 
That the city sleeps to hide...

									DISSOLVING TO:

INT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE BEACH - DAY

The first heavy strains of BREAK ON THROUGH driving over the 
DISSOLVE. It sounds bad technically, but it's hot. Random 
raw screams and shouting. PAM is crosslegged on the floor, 
clapping to the music, number one fan.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
		(live)
	The day destroys the night 
	Night divides the day 
	Tried to run 
	Tried to hide 
	Break on thru to the other side

JIM straining to make it work, jumping around violent, still 
not in control. Yet searching. JOHN cutting out.

		JOHN
	That's really square. Let's hip it 
	up. Jump on your cues.

		RAY
	Tighten it up. Stay with the beat 
	Jim. You're dragging.

		JIM
	Let's try it again, come on. I'm 
	just getting into it.

		PAM
		(on floor)
	I think it's hot!!

		ROBBIE
		(strumming)
	I still think the lyrics are weird 
	man.

		JOHN
		(frustrated)
	I still think it sounds like the 
	bottom of a fishbowl man.

		JIM
		(to Robbie, aggravated)
	Then you write one man! We need more 
	songs anyway. We all gotta go back 
	and write.

They're drained, tired, in a large rehersal/living room 30 
feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the 
beach at Marina. The room is filled with golden, gorgeous 
setting sunlight.

PAMELA goes to the kitchen with DOROTHY, Ray's Japanese 
fiancee.

		ROBBIE
	I been working on something goes 
	like this... A minor.
		(chords his guitar)
	"You know that it would be untrue 
	You know that I would be a liar 
	If I was to say to you 
	Girl, we couldn't get much higher" 
	F sharp... chorus 
	"Come on baby, light my fire 
	Try to set the night on fire..."

Robbie's voice is tinny but something immediate's in the 
air, all the radar out.

		RAY
	Okay man there's some good changes 
	in there.

		JIM
	Got any more lyrics?

		ROBBIE
		(gives Jim a page of 
		lyrics)
	Some. I call it "Light My Fire". I 
	figger if I'm gonna compete with 
	your stuff it's gotta be about earth, 
	fire or snakes.

		JIM
	Don't underestimate Death.

		JOHN
	Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds 
	man, we're not folk rock man. How 
	'bout trying it with a Latin beat.

		ROBBIE
	I thought we could do the usual verse 
	chorus verse chorus and

		JOHN
	We don't need a bridge.

		ROBBIE
	Yeah, we could maybe improvise a 
	couple piano and guitar solos over 
	it
		(kicks in second verse)
	"The time to hesitate is through"
		(doesn't have the 
		second line)
	Du du duh dud dada . . .

		JIM
		(spontaneous)
	"No time to wallow in the mire 
	Try now we can only lose 
	And our love become a funeral pyre 
	Come on baby light my fire"

John drumming it, different, more Latin.

		JIM
	Pretty good! Pretty neat!!

		RAY
		(to John)
	Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka, 
	then bula burump bula
		(to Robbie)
	...you're right, it could take a 
	coupla long solos, that's wild man, 
	like Butterfield did on "East-West" -- 
	really hip.

		ROBBIE
	Y'ever heard Coltrane's "Favorite 
	Things"?

		JOHN
		(hitting the drums)
	Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put 
	it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and 
	snare.

		RAY
		(clicking, excited)
	Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz! 
	That then is jazz! But it needs a 
	hook. Something. Give me some space. 
	I need some space. Leave the room 
	guys. Come on! Go!

The three excluded Doors head out to the beach like obedient 
schoolboys while Ray fools with his organ.

EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY

As they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as 
they feel the excitement of a new song.

		JOHN
		(irritated at Ray)
	Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin' 
	people around! I thought we were 
	equals!

		JIM
	Aren't we?
		(to Robbie)
	That was great Robbie. Whaddaya 
	thinking about when you play?

		ROBBIE
	Don't know. Mostly the fish in my 
	fish tank.

		JIM
		(laughs)
	Hey whadya say we take some of that 
	Tijuana acid and see what kinda 
	trouble we can get into tonight?

		ROBBIE
	The chicks always go for you man. I 
	get the dogs.

		JIM
	Then we'll start a religion or plan 
	a murder or go to Tijuana.

		JOHN
	Whatsamatter with you man, what about 
	Pam, you got the morals of a coyote.

		JIM
	Why you wanna sleep with her John, 
	just to bug me?

		JOHN
	Hell NO!

		JIM
	...means "hell yes". She likes you 
	man, she really does and y'all should. 
	What's a rock and roll band for man, 
	if you can't party all night and do 
	bad things?

		RAY
		(yelling from the 
		house)
	I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE. 
	HURRY.

		JOHN
	Sieg Heil!

As they head back.

INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY

TIGHT on RAY like a schoolmaster cueing them.

		RAY
	Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count 
	it off John

		JOHN
		(clicking)
	1... 2... 1 - 2 - 3
		(crack)

It goes. The famous organ intro to LIGHT MY FIRE blends over 
the room like magic, carrying JIM, ROBBIE, JOHN, DOROTHY, 
PAMELA along over:

EXT. SUNSET STRIP (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT (1966)

A row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic. 
Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD, 
TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE 
TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... . 
Headlights and neon intercut with:

DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS, 
running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting 
kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up 
their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE 
carries over the montage.

DOORS SONG 
You know that it would be untrue etc.

		JIM VOICE
		(last session)
	The music was new black polished 
	chrome and came over the summer like 
	liquid night.

EXT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

"THE DOORS -- BAND FROM VENICE" on the marquee... moving 
down to a motley crew of TEENAGE GIRLS, underage, trying to 
get past the BOUNCER. The sounds of BREAK ON THROUGH carry 
past when the doors open and close admitting a SAILOR.

		GIRL GROUPIE
		(approaching, to 2nd 
		girl)
	Is that horny motherfucker in the 
	black pants here tonight?

		BOUNCER
	IDs! IDs! Can't get in without an 
	I.D..

		GIRL 2
	Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I'm on 
	the list.

		BOUNCER
	I forgot my list.

INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

BREAK ON THROUGH blasting out at us from a sleazehole -- 
half full -- BIKERS, SAILORS, HOOKERS, a baseball game on 
the TV. A dance floor the size of a bed, the DOORS on a tiny 
platform above the bar, London newspapers on the wall.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
		(live)
	We chased our pleasures here 
	Dug our treasures there 
	Can you still recall the time we 
	cried 
	BREAK on through to the other side 
	(3)

Some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base of 
the stage, muscling past PAM, but most people ignore them, 
drinking, arguing, dancing to their own fuckbeats. Possibly 
this has something to do with the fact that JIM sings with 
his back to all of them.

JOHN looking over furious at RAY who mutters under the music.

		RAY
	Turn around Jim! Come on let 'em in.

		JIM
	I found an island in your arms 
	A country in your eyes 
	Arms that chained us, eyes that lied
		(CHORUS)

Jim jumps around violently to the front, getting the attention 
of all. Rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand, 
leaning against it, not yet comfortable with the extrovert 
side of himself, eyes closed, but starting to enjoy it. He 
sings to Pam.

INT. BACKSTAGE - THE FOG - THAT NIGHT

JERRY, the ex-vice cop manager who runs the joint, can't 
understand the appeal, talking to JIM and ROBBIE who are 
packing and hauling their equipment out. DOROTHY is there.

		PAM
		(innocently)
	So Jerry... do we get paid for this?

		JERRY
		(ignoring her)
	What shit, "day destroys the night", 
	"crawl back in your brain", "go 
	insane". What do people wanna pay 
	money to hear that shit.

		JIM
		(explains it, gentle)
	The greater the suffering, the more 
	terrible the events, the greater the 
	pleasure Jerry. They want it, it's 
	catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks.

		JERRY
		(amused)
	We're in Los Angeles punk, how would 
	you know, they like your pants, 
	they're not listenin' to you, what 
	the hell they see in you I...

		JIM
		(laughs)
	But they understand Jerry. All our 
	real desires are unconscious and 
	unseen. . .

		JERRY
		(scratching his head)
	...you're the weirdest fuckin' guy I 
	ever...

		JIM
	You love us?

		JERRY
	I love ya. You got two more shows to 
	do.

Camera gliding across the small crowded smokey room to RAY 
and JOHN in conversation with a slick Beverly Hills MANAGER 
type.

		MANAGER
	...I got some real tight record 
	company connections, just leave it 
	to me man, I'll take you guys all 
	the fuckin' way, you blew my mind 
	out there.

		RAY
	Yeah right, but what about the music?

		MANAGER
	Hey the music? I love it man, that's 
	why we're talking right? Some of 
	it's a little on the dark side though. 
	Ya know ya oughta get some tunes 
	like Herman's Hermits stuff -- "Mrs. 
	Brown you got a lovely daughter". 
	That shit goes right to the radio 
	man.

		RAY
	Uh huh. Well, how 'bout gettin' us 
	some real equipment?

		MANAGER
	Listen, I sign you guys to a five 
	year management contract and you got 
	it all. Equipment. Demo. A truck 
	WITH roadies. Three, maybe four 
	percent record deal. Wherever ya 
	want to go babe, trust me, I'll get 
	you there. Whatd'ya say?

		RAY
		(exchanging looks 
		with John)
	We'll have a band meeting. The four 
	of us do everything unanimously or 
	we don't do it.

		MANAGER
	The musketeers. I'm touched. But 
	lemme tell you something -- loyalty 
	don't pay the bills. Think about it. 
	Call me tomorrow.

He gives Ray a card, leaving, crossing to Jim and PAM talking.

		JOHN
		(to Ray)
	What a sleaze! Man, Jim's gotta start 
	facing the crowd if he's gonna be 
	the front man.

		RAY
	He's just getting his confidence.

		JOHN
	He never does what we rehearsed. 
	What's the point of...

		RAY
	How does it feel?

		JOHN
	Great, but...

Pam on payphone calling her friends to come.

		PAM
	...make sure you get Barb and Sue 
	Anne to come. And tell them to ask 
	for Jim!

The MANAGER on his way out leaning into Jim's face, slyly.

		MANAGER
	Jim, how old are you?

		JIM
	Ah, twenty one...

		MANAGER
	Jesus, you're a gold mine, I'll make 
	it quick and to the point and if you 
	repeat it I'll deny it -- drop these 
	guys, I'll put you with some real 
	musicians, your voice, your looks, 
	that's what'll sell records, we'll 
	make a million bucks. A year. Goodbye. 
	Call me. I'm right. He gives Jim a 
	card and goes. Pam disgusted with 
	the type, Jim laughs, likes the guy.

		JIM
	I like a man wears his soul on his 
	face.

		RAY
		(coming over)
	"Whiskey's" next, I can feel it in 
	my bones.

		ROBBIE
	I still think the lyrics are weird.

INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

MONTAGE EFFECT -- Jim sings "A Little Game" on the Fog stage. 
Super over WHISKEY sign.

EXT. SUNSET STRIP -- THAT NIGHT

CU moving down -- the "LOVE" is on the marquee at the famous 
WHISKY A GO GO as we move down to see JIM, PAM, and the DOORS. 
Jim jumps through the TEEMING TRAFFIC (horns, anger) right 
in front of a COP CAR, crossing to a long line of teenage 
FANS dying to get into the club.

		JIM
		(to Ray, innocently)
	Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted 
	to fuck me, I could feel it for the 
	first time!

		RAY
	Right on stud. But you better watch 
	out for the guys.

		JIM
		(to the band)
	Guys, I'm serious about the desert, 
	we still gotta deepen man, we gotta 
	take some peyote -- all of us 
	together, we got one more stage to 
	go...

		ROBBIE
	I don't know man, fucks up my playing. 
	I been playing music for 10 years 
	man and this is the first time in my 
	whole damned life I ever played it.

		JIM
	Are you satisfied?

		JOHN
	Will you get off my case! I'm never 
	doing acid again. Too many bad trips 
	man.

		JIM
	It's not acid John, it's peyote. 
	It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to 
	be more... more... more...

		JOHN
	I'm into TM man. I promised my guru...

		PAM
	I want to! I want to! I'm ready. 
	Let's go to the desert... do the 
	peyote, the good peyote.

		JIM
		(to girl in line)
	Who's on now?

		GIRL 1
		(withering look, very 
		hip)
	"Love".

		JIM
	Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool.

		GIRL 1
	They're the best... better'n the 
	Beatles.

		JIM
	You mean the Marx Brothers of music, 
	we could blow 'em away.

The GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk.

		GIRL 2
	And who are you?

		JIM
	The Doors... We're up the street at 
	the Fog.

Laughter from the GIRLS.

		GIRL 1
		(contempt)
	The Doors. I heard of you. That's 
	the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to 
	the Fog if you paid me.

		JIM
	Oh yeah what would you do for money?

		PAM
	Let's go Jim, come on.

Meanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2.

		JOHN
	So you don't have a phone number? 
	What do you mean you don't have a 
	phone number?

		GIRL 2
	I don't have a phone number. So give 
	me your number then.

		JOHN
	I don't have a phone.

Robbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL 
who's laughing.

		GIRL 1
		(intrigued, to Jim)
	Well, would you leave my name at the 
	door?

		JIM
	Well I don't know. What's your name?

		GIRL 1
	Caprice.

		JIM
	Caprice? That's the dumbest name I 
	ever heard.

A look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away, 
gives the girl a look.

		JIM
	Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do 
	Anything! Raise your hands if you 
	understand! Alive, any of you alive -- 
	let's take a poll -- how many of you 
	know you're really alive!!

The crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells.

		JIM
	No one? Raise your hands c'mon man... 
	let's go.

On the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile.

We IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE 
IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote.

JIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears -- 
a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the 
car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum 
beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping 
up dustdevils.

They're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere 
on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent 
rocks and cacti...

A football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the 
four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the 
peyote.

PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort 
her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune.

		JIM
	Everybody having a good time?

They hug. She throws up again.

		JIM
	...awright, pretty good, it gets 
	better.

Jim holds his head. Feels the ride.

		JIM
	WOA!! It's fast.

JUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows. 
Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird. 
"Hawk! Hawk!" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.

Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense 
torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces, 
their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their 
teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.

		JIM
	When the serpent appears, his head 
	is ten feet long and five feet wide. 
	He has one red eye and one green 
	eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles 
	long. As he moves -- on his scales 
	is written all the history of the 
	world, all people, all actions, all 
	of us our little pictures on the 
	scales, God it's big! -- and it's 
	eating as it moves all the time, 
	devouring, digesting consciousness, 
	power, a monster of energy!

John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray. Jim seems possessed.

		JIM
	We must kiss the snake on the tongue, 
	if it senses our fear, it will eat 
	us instantly. But if we kiss it 
	without fear, the snake will take us 
	through the garden and out the gate. 
	To our freedom -we must ride this 
	snake. To the end of time.

Pause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group.

		JOHN
	I think I'm fucked up. I'm not 
	thinking right.

		JIM
	You're fucked up John. Go with it, 
	confusion is the sound of creation.

		JOHN
	You should see your eyes right now, 
	you're death. Look at your eyes -- 
	you're crazy man, you look crazy. 
	You scare me.

		JIM
	No no no John John. God is crazy 
	too. God is part insane as well as 
	sane. Not in control all the time. 
	Dionysus was the God of the wine. He 
	made ecstasy but he also made madness. 
	Madness is all right. That's what 
	you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's 
	that joint?

		ROBBIE
		(crying)
	I get scared thinking of all the 
	choices inside. I could go. I could 
	stay. I can live anywhere. I could 
	die now if I wanted. It's limitless 
	choice... and no one cares.

		JIM
	Die Robbie.

		JOHN
	What the fuck!

		PAM
		(wandering in)
	I don't know what I am. I'm on the 
	cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn. 
	Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn 
	domestic and safe, so I don't know 
	which one to be.

Jim looking at her, smiles.

		JIM
	I love you.

		DOROTHY
		(into the same lens)
	Oh my God, the light, it's so 
	beautiful Ray. Can you see it... 
	it's all one... honey?

Ray has his head buried in his hands.

		RAY
	I'm in pain man. I want something 
	from the peyote. I feel the universe 
	functioning perfectly but I'm still 
	perfectly locked inside myself. 
	Instead of Oneness, I feel total 
	Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain... 
	Jim, all I feel is pain.

		JIM
	Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. 
	Pain is meant to wake us up. People 
	try to hide their pain but they're 
	wrong.

		JOHN
	I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything 
	I can, and I know it will never be 
	enough.

		JIM
		(whispers)
	Pam wants you.
		(normal)
	You're a good Catholic John, you 
	want it so you can feel guilty about 
	it... Fuck death away John.

		ROBBIE
	I feel Fear... so bad I just numb 
	out all my feelings. I'm afraid of 
	my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I 
	wish I could play my guitar.

		JIM
	Maybe you should kill your father 
	Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill 
	him!

		ROBBIE
	I'm so fucking scared.

		JIM
	But you're Alive! It's beautiful! 
	Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know 
	all our feelings before we can come 
	out the other side free men. Don't 
	feel ashamed of yourselves, don't 
	let society destroy your reality. 
	Our freedom's the only thing worth 
	dying for, it's the only thing worth 
	living for!

He takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them, 
reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the 
gates at evening.

		JOHN
		(cold sweats)
	I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared 
	Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is 
	coming on.

		JIM
	Then use us John, use our strength, 
	it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, 
	everything we have comes from the 
	same source, the great Creator of 
	Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the 
	snake. . . I promise you I will be 
	with you till the end of time.

Pulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk 
to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep-
throated "shoooh... shoooh"... now humming a song from the 
desert.

		JIM
	My wild love went riding... mmmmmm. 
	She rode all the day. She ride to 
	the devil. And ask for him to pay... 
	shooo shoooo

The OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling 
like a collective breath.

		JIM
		(ad lib)
	...she went to the desert she went 
	to the sea Joseph we did see...

Suddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie, 
John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the 
desperation of her eyes.

		JIM
		(to himself)
	...I'm lying to you. I am scared.

He goes, his boots in the sand.

		JOHN
	Jim, where are you going.

		JIM
		(looking back)
	I'll be back. I gotta go alone.

Pamela calling from another dune, far away.

		PAM
	Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't 
	go away.

His POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in 
pain. Cannot help her.

A BIRD of prey in the sky.

Jim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun 
is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in 
the distance. "Jim, where are you going?" A mother's voice, 
a father's voice.

DOORS SONG 
Can you picture what will be 
So limitless and free 
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate 
land 
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are 
insane: waiting for the summer rain

FLASHBACKS

INT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT

JIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back...

At the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the 
older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian... 
his eyes.

INT. MORRISON HOME - DAY

Somewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing 
his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S 
feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents 
come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch 
he is drawing.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

An OLD WOMAN is beckoning to him from an opening in the face 
of the mountain... then she's gone.

JIM bounds towards the crevice.

INT. ROCK PALACE - DAY

He is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering, 
leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is 
visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls 
ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the 
cave. Silence.

Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN 
PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong 
figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the 
hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities 
proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of 
Creation.

Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- 
staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...

DOORS SONG 
There's danger on the edge of town 
Ride the King's highway 
Weird scenes inside the gold mine 
Ride the King's highway west, baby

The sound of a rattle -- "shichishichi" -- he realizes he's 
being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large 
LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of 
a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue 
and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the 
sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the 
appearance of the shaman.

Jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient 
mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him.

The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are 
looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, 
some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no 
lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent 
dialect or huararchi.

		INDIAN GHOST VOICE
	...you are a prince among white men, 
	yet you are a warrior among us. You 
	are ready now. Go out "walk with the 
	pain of the world, travel to the end 
	of the wind" -- and change it for 
	all men as you were born to do.

The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- 
leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he 
knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you 
have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

JIM exits the cave.

								MATCH CUT TO:

INT. WHISKY A GO GO - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE on JIM'S EYES as he continues with THE END.

DOORS SONG 
Ride the snake 
Ride the snake, to the lake 
The ancient lake 
The snake is long, seven miles 
Ride the snake 
He's old, and his skin is cold

Camera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different 
tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing 
outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his 
face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in 
what he has to say.

Cliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the 
stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. 
Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the 
musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his 
audience.

Nobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO 
GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang 
motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have 
stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going 
to happen.

PAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of 
this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, 
doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him -- 
JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL 
ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	The west is best (2) 
	Get here and we'll do the rest 
	The blue bus is calling us (2) 
	Driver where you taking us?

The band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding 
across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, 
wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he 
feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar.

JOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous 
and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures 
Jim's ears with his drums.

And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big 
flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, 
yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the 
messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is 
something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to 
play Jim.

And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" -- 
ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the 
world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to 
lead.

		JIM
	The killer awoke before dawn 
	He put his boots on 
	He took a face from the ancient 
	gallery 
	And he walked on down the hall

Ray looks over up from his board, catches Robby with a 'what's 
this?' look... They go with it, improvising...

Jim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms; 
it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what 
he's going to say next.

		JIM
	He went to the room where his sister 
	lived 
	And he paid a visit to his brother 
	And then he went on down the hall...

Pamela sensing something is coming... the AUDIENCE... Jerry... 
the go-go dancers...

		JIM
	And he came to a door, And he looked 
	inside "Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want 
	to kill you".

FLASH -- A FATHER'S FACE, any face, older, any man...

		JIM
	Mother... I want to...

FLASH -- A MOTHER'S FACE, any face, older, a woman

		JIM
	AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH 
	YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!! FUCK YOU ALL 
	NIGHT!

The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from 
the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the 
walls...

As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned...

As the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly 
SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted 
and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a 
puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed 
a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, 
a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter 
who has killed his first man.

RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie 
and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying 
to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream.

The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry 
exploding off the balcony toward the stage...

Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go-
go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the 
groupies love it.

Jim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around 
the mike.

		JIM
	Come on baby take a chance with us 
	(X3) 
	And meet me in the back of the blue 
	bus 
	Doona blue rog onna blue bus 
	Doona blue yeah! 
	Come on yeah!

INT. BACKSTAGE WHISKY HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

JIM is being muscled out the door by JERRY, livid.

		JERRY
	NOBODY'S GONNA FUCK THEIR MOTHER ON 
	MY STAGE! YOU'RE OUTTA HERE. You 
	don't ever come back to play, you 
	don't ever come back to drink -- 
	You're DEAD ON THE STRIP!

		JIM
		(ranting back at him)
	Kill the father, fuck the mother, 
	kill the father, fuck the mother -- 
	that's what I'm into! That's what 
	I'm into!

Jerry pinning Jim to the wall,

		JERRY
	You -- MORRISON! You're fucking filthy 
	twisted perverse punk, get back to 
	your fucking sewer!!

		JIM
		(calmly smiling)
	You have the face of a pig man.

Lost in the melee, RAY and JOHN springing Jim back from likely 
death

		RAY
	JERRY JERRY... He was talking about 
	Oedipus! GREEK TRAGEDY!! It's ART!!

		JERRY
	FUCK ART!! GET THE FUCK ART OUT!!!

Pushing, shoving, scrambling. Past a long-haired JOURNALIST 
yelling into a payphone.

		JOURNALIST
	NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE DOORS -- 
	NEVER!! GET A PHOTOGRAPHER DOWN HERE. 
	"ROLLING STONE'S GOTTA SEE THIS!!

As they rumble by him, all yelling at once. Into the street.

EXT. ALLEY &amp; STAIRCASE OUTSIDE WHISKY - THAT NIGHT

The DOORS go sailing out, followed by one of their drums, 
JOHN and ROBBIE restraining Jim from going back in.

		JIM
	TAKE A LONG LOOK OLD MAN. WE ARE THE 
	FUTURE. WE ARE THINGS TO COME.

		JERRY
	FUCK YOU... YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!

Wanting to come after Jim but restrained now by the RECORD 
MOGULS, HOLZMAN and ROTHCHILD.

		PAUL
	Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it... 
	he's a kid, it's a song about dying, 
	changing...

JAC HOLZMAN pushing past to Ray. Pamela separating Jim 
visually from Jerry.

		JOHN
		(to RAY and ROBBIE)
	We'll never work again man. The Mafia 
	controls all these clubs.

		HOLZMAN
		(to Ray and Robbie)
	Quite a night! Hi, I'm Jac Holzman. 
	I own Elektra Records.

		RAY
		(knows the name)
	Oh sure, hi.

Holzman pauses, a dramatic presence, six foot two, impeccably 
dressed, he knows the weight of his words.

		HOLZMAN
	Listen... I think if you could just 
	put what you did in there on record, 
	we could really have something... 
	and we could make a lot of money...

It hangs there. Impossible words.

		RAY
	Yeah?

John and Robbie sharing looks.

		HOLZMAN
		(pointing to ROTHCHILD 
		coming up)
	Yeah... and Rothchild here was born 
	to be your producer.

		ROBBIE
		(recognizing Paul)
	Hey, the guy that did Butterfield!

		PAUL
	Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock. 
	Give me a fucking break. You guys 
	are amazing! Let's go make a record.

		JIM
		(to Ray, pointing 
		back at Jerry)
	Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us?

		HOLZMAN
		(amused)
	Why don't you go inside and ask him 
	Jim?

Strains of LIGHT MY FIRE cross the cut.

INT. SUNSET SOUND RECORDING STUDIO - DAY (1966)

Four-track TAPE SYSTEM is rolling.

DOORS SONG 
You know that it would be untrue 
You know that I would be a liar 
If I was to say to you 
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Camera moving fast thru the control room, past the ENGINEER 
(BRUCE BOTNICK), taciturn, 20's, the PRODUCER (PAUL ROTHCHILD) 
in pig heaven, and the owner JAC HOLZMAN in his blue suit 
watching.

		PAUL
	Hey Bruce, you feel it?

		BRUCE
	I'm having big fun.

		PAUL
		(to Jac)
	I got goosebumps Jac. This is history 
	going down here. An album of killer 
	music in six days... six days... 
	unreal!

Camera moving fast past a smiling PAM watching, out to the 
DOORS on the floor, jamming... on to JIM in the vocal booth, 
headphone to his ears.

		JIM
	Come on baby, LIGHT MY FIIIRRRREEEE!!!

The song, now fully -- orchestrated, rolling on over the 
following MONTAGE:

		JIM
		(after song)
	Pretty good! Pretty neat!

EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - SAN FRANCISCO (DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE) - 
DAY (1967)

LIGHT MY FIRE continues.

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of the "Human Be-In", the "Summer of 
Love" -- swarming FLOWER CHILDREN, WAR PROTESTORS.

A staged 16mm. grainy shot of JIM and PAMELA, RAY and DOROTHY, 
JOHN, ROBBIE and their TWO NEW GIRLFRIENDS wandering thru 
the CROWD sharing the spirit. Pam and Jim fool around -- 
laughing -- tickling each other for the home movie camera 
shot by Ray... Pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him 
running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips 
him. He chases her across the lawn.

INT. FILLMORE WEST STAGE - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (1967)

The CROWD is "beautiful" -- candles, incense sticks, flowers, 
vibes of peace and love. The instrumental of "Light My Fire" 
is playing, but only three DOORS are on stage till Jim comes 
swinging across on a rope like tarzan all the way across the 
stage -- then drops down, rebounds lithely and hits the mike.

		JIM
		(singing)
	The time to hesitate is through 
	No time to wallow in the mire.

JIM swandives into the stoned crowd with the mike at the 
instrumental section, a colored spotlight flecking him, GIRLS 
kiss him. The guys want to be him, the girls want him -- and 
he knows it, teasing and tantalizing them...

		JIM
	Try now we can only lose 
	And our love become a funeral pyre 
	Come on baby, light my fire 
	Try to set the night on 
	FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!!!

BODYGUARDS running in to pull him out as he's tossed, like a 
limp god, over the heads of the crowd, rolling like a buoy 
on a rocking sea, from hand to hand, Dionysus, devoured limb 
from limb by the "little girls".

PAMELA watching from the side curtain.

ALABAMA SONG (WHISKY BAR) now kicks in with its comic, 
Brechtian strain as we:

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY

Screaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane, 
scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the 
lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a 
home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE 
and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS...

DOORS SONG 
Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar 
Oh don't ask why 
Oh don't ask why

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE (SEEN FROM PLANE) - DAY

The City as seen by:

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

JIM'S face pressed to the window, PAMELA next to him hugging 
each other.

		JIM
		(real close, hugging 
		her)
	I don't mind dying in a plane crash, 
	a smile on my face.

		PAMELA
		(cutting his food)
	As compared to what?

		JIM
	I just don't want to go out slow -- 
	brain tumor, botulism. I want to 
	feel what it's like, cause death is 
	only going to happen to you once.

		PAMELA
	I don't want to die ever, what a 
	weird thing to say.

DOORS SONG 
For if we don't find the next whisky bar 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you 
I tell you 
I tell you we must die

EXT. CBS - NEW YORK - NIGHT (SUMMER, 1967)

A LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee. 
The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS.

DOORS SONG 
Oh moon of Alabama 
We now must say goodbye 
We've lost our good ol mama 
We must have whiskey oh you know why

INT. LIMO - NIGHT

JIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA. 
The look on his face is ironic.

His POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the 
windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces 
deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks 
below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back, 
linking arms to clear a path for the Doors.

DOORS SONG 
Show me the way to the next little girl 
Oh don't ask why 
Oh don't ask why

The GIRLS crying hysterically as Jim lazily, leopardly, moves 
across the CROWD, almost like Oswald waiting for the Ruby 
bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark 
glasses concealing...

		GIRLS
		(faint)
	Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove 
	youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase, 
	Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take 
	a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please 
	look at me Jim!!

Their voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon 
with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing 
her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with 
Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO 
COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with 
everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with 
the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a 
picture, seems to like it.

DOORS SONG 
For if we don't find the next little girl 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you 
I tell you 
I tell you we must die

INT. CBS BACKSTAGE - THAT EVENING

The nervous PRODUCER, HERB, leading "MR. SULLIVAN" thru the 
corridor to the Doors' DRESSING ROOM past several "ACTS" 
getting ready to go on... animals, tumblers, a soprano 
wailing...

		PRODUCER
	Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're 
	called "the Doors". They got the 
	number one single in the country -- 
	"Light Your Fire".

		SULLIVAN
	"Light Your Fire"? Is that sooo?

		PRODUCER
	They look pretty grungy but we're...

INT. DOORS DRESSING ROOM - EVENING

Bedlam. MAKE-UP ARTISTS pancaking the faces of the DOORS -- 
the nightmare coming true. RAY in a white suit with too many 
pinstripes. ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long 
sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye 
splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough 
by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally 
self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV 
appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature 
black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles -- 
watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing 
Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy.

		JOHN
		(indignant)
	You're gonna cut it!

		HAIRDRESSER
		(doing John)
	No, I'm going to worship it. What 
	kind of shampoo are you using?

		JOHN
	The kind you get in hotels.

		HAIRDRESSER
	Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don't 
	want split ends, you're a celebrity 
	now.
		(moving to Ray)
	You have very serious-serious hair, 
	it needs to rebel. I'll give it a 
	tinge of something freaky.

		RAY
	I'd rather stay the same color.

		HAIRDRESSER
	Scaredy cat.

		ROBBIE
	What about me?

		HAIRDRESSER
		(a look)
	Honey, we don't have enough time.

TELEVISION INSERT -- images of DETROIT burning, summer of 
67.

		TV NEWSMAN
	...here in Detroit, 42 people dead, 
	more than 2000 injured... 1400 
	buildings burned, 5000 people have 
	just lost their homes as Detroit 
	joins more than 100 cities torn by 
	riots this hot summer!

On JIM, as they pancake him, reflective.

		JIM
	No wonder "Light My Fire's" number 
	one.

		HAIRDRESSER
		(to JIM)
	What about you handsome?

		JIM
		(friendly)
	The biggest mistakes in my life have 
	been haircuts.

		PAM
	Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes 
	it the way it is...

		HAIRDRESSER
		(backing off)
	All right, be mean...

Commotion from the doorway as the PRODUCER leads the lock-
jawed MR. SULLIVAN in with everyone bowing and scraping to 
the Pope.

		PRODUCER
	Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan

Mr. Sullivan waves from the doorway.

		SULLIVAN
	Hi boys, heard your song "Light That 
	Fire"
		(Herb corrects)
	...think you're great... good luck 
	out there.

		DOORS
		(ad lib)
	Oh thanks Mr. Sullivan.

		PRODUCER
		(moving alongside Ray)
	Well the guys at Network have told 
	us they have a small problem with 
	the lyrics "girl we couldn't get 
	much higher". You can't say "higher" 
	on network so they asked if... you 
	could say, "girl we can't get much 
	better"... can you dig that?

A look from the guys. Jim sullen. Tension in the air. Mr. 
Sullivan waiting.

		JIM
	How 'bout, "girl you couldn't bite 
	my wire".

Pause. The producer puzzled a beat. It doesn't go down.

		PRODUCER
	I don't think Standards and Practices 
	would...

Sullivan exiting, waving at no one in particular like Nixon 
would.

		SULLIVAN
	Look, you boys don't forget to smile 
	now. Don't be so sullen out there...

		JIM
	Uh well, we're kind of a sullen group, 
	Ed.

SIDDONS reassuring the Producer.

		SIDDONS
	We'll work it out Herb, promise. 
	Give me five.

		PRODUCER
		(not totally convinced, 
		exiting)
	Groovy! Uh you boys should know Mr. 
	Sullivan is considering you boys for 
	four more shows. You dig?

Pause.

		JOHN
	Well?

		JIM
	What -- are we the Beatles now John?

		RAY
		(laughs)
	It's only a word man. The Stones 
	changed...

		JIM
	Hey Ray, why don't you change your 
	name to Sid or Irving Manzarek or 
	something... it's only a word y'know.

		ROBBIE
	It's my words. I don't care, let's 
	just jam.

Ray's seething tension. Younger brother starting to get out 
of hand.

INT. STUDIO STAGE - THAT NIGHT

SULLIVAN stiffly introducing them.

		SULLIVAN
	Now here on our stage direct from 
	Los Angeles, California, ladies and 
	gentlemen, The Doors!

The lights come up on the DOORS in their ultimate nightmare -- 
each Door appearing consecutively in a lightspot as Jim sings 
the ubiquitous "Light My Fire", trapped in this Elvis Presley -- 
Vegas act, he looks like he couldn't care less. DOORS hang 
suspended everywhere on the set -- their name spelled out in 
big block standup letters.

Jim has a hard-on in his pants, barely concealed by his tight 
leathers.

		PRODUCER
		(in control booth)
	What's that?... oh Jesus!... get off 
	it!! Where's he going?

Jim misses his marks deliberately, the camera having a hard 
time following him.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	You know that it would be untrue 
	You know that I would be a liar 
	If I was to say to you 
	Girl, we couldn't get much higher 
	Come on baby light my fire

INT. CONTROL BOOTH (SIMULTANEOUS) - THAT NIGHT

The PRODUCERS freaking out.

		PRODUCER
		(hyperventilating)
	He said it! He said it! On National 
	TV You can't do that! You can't do 
	that!!! You blew it you little shit! 
	You'll never play Ed Sullivan again.

Jim on the monitors, singing through to his freedom, falls 
on the floor flat, the camera missing him completely.

		JIM
	Come on baby, light my fire 
	Try to set the night on FIIIIRRRRRE!

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NEW YORK - NIGHT

OVERHEAD ANGLE -- JIM lies there in a sweat. PAMELA pulls 
off him, naked, frustrated, trying to rouse him.

		PAM
		(tender)
	What can I do, what do you want me 
	to do?... Jim?

		JIM
	I don't know... I guess I should see 
	a doctor or something... maybe I 
	should go to someone of the straight 
	Jungian philosophy.

		PAM
	It happens to other guys too...

Jim, quietly pissed, reaches for the whiskey bottle at the 
side of the bed.

		JIM
	It's so scary up there. To be adored. 
	Isn't that irony? Teenage death girls 
	want my dick -- a mere clown -- not 
	my words. I'll never wake up in a 
	good mood again... Lament for my 
	cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in 
	the feathered night, gives life, 
	soar and crucify, I seek to know 
	you...

		PAM
	It's not so complicated Jim, it's 
	just sex, y'know.

		JIM
	You should marry an insurance 
	salesman.

		PAM
	It's the hours man, the pressure, 
	everything's like your last 
	performance, you're setting yourself 
	up.

		JIM
	We weren't built to last.

		PAM
	Aren't you doing this for you, because 
	you're a poet, not a rock star. Ed 
	Sullivan's not a place for you.

		JIM
	You really know what I am Pam? You 
	know what poetry is? Where is the 
	feast they promised us? Where is the 
	wine -- the new wine -- dying on the 
	vine?

		PAM
	What are you saying!

		JIM
	Y'see -- I lied to you. I really 
	love Fame.

		PAM
		(Here we go)
	Why are you doing this to me?

		JIM
		(drinks)
	'Cause you're in the room.

She tries to take the bottle away. He resists. They struggle. 
It becomes a fight.

		PAM
	And this is gonna help! It's probably 
	the cause. 'Least put some soul in 
	your success asshole!

		JIM
	Maybe you're the cause!

		PAM
	Right.

		JIM
	I mean I don't have this problem 
	with anybody else.

		PAM
		(getting the bottle)
	Give it to me!!!

		JIM
		(getting it back)
	No!!!!! Mommy!!!

		PAM
		(gives up, tries to 
		exit)
	Fuck you man I'm outta here.

He grabs her. They lurch, smashing the lamp. WILD CHILD song 
kicking in.

		JIM
		(excited now)
	Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah, 
	go fuck the other guys. How many 
	white guys have you fucked Pam? 10, 
	20? Black guys what? You like Chinese 
	dicks? Mongolian penis? 30?

		PAM
		(fighting)
	...how many dogs have you fucked! 
	You don't say No to anybody! Drugs, 
	dogs, uglies, you'd fuck a doorknob 
	with butter on it!

		JIM
	How could I do that

		PAM
		(shouting top of her 
		lungs)
	You're the first one who couldn't 
	make it with me anyway! You're the 
	only limp dick in the lot!!!

Camera running at them from the end of the room. JIM laughs 
manically as they roll off the bed into a wall. Kicking, 
hitting hard.

DOORS SONG 
Wild Child full of grace 
Savior of the human race 
Your cool face 
Natural child, terrible child 
Not your mother or your father's child 
Your own child, screaming wild

		JIM
	HA HA HA!! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!

		PAM
	NO! WILL YOU DIE FOR ME!!

		JIM
	I'D DIE FOR ANYBODY.

		PAM
	WHAT ABOUT ME! WHAT ABOUT ME!

		JIM
	CUNT CUNT CUNT.

		PAM
	LIAR LIAR LIAR. YOU PROMISED. YOU 
	PROMISED.

		JIM
	I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY.

A VOICE across the wall joining in, banging.

		VOICE
	SHADDUP WILLYA. I'M TRYING TO 
	SLEEP!!!!

		JIM
	THEN MOVE TO MIAMI YOU SLAVE!!!

More nagging. By this time the fight has expired of its own 
volition.

		JIM
		(quietly)
	You were saying?

They giggle, start to laugh. Then they cuddle on the floor, 
in the corner, in this semi-lit New York hotel room.

		JIM
		(low)
	...will you die for me, Pam, a clown, 
	a despicable clown?... a mere 
	despicable clown?

		PAM
	Yes yes yes.

		JIM
	...I need a home. A place to hide.

		PAM
	...with me. Yes... yes...

		JIM
		(mumbling)
	...how could we make a home?... where 
	there's sanctuary?

		PAM
	...yes, yes, yes.

He's hard now. She's guiding him inside her.

		JIM
	...we're in Africa, we're just 
	animals... I wanna stay inside you 
	all night baby... let's fuck death 
	away, now fuck death away...

		PAM
	...yes...

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - HOTEL SUITE NEW YORK - DAY

Camera moving in past the buffet, champagne, flowers in the 
hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK... to the DOORS in 
armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN 
JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS... JIM behind dark shades 
drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches, decked out in snakeskin.

		JOURNALIST 1
		(stiff, Times type)
	What are your songs about Mr. 
	Morrison?

TIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers. A vaguely 
dreamy quality.

		JIM
	Uh love death travel... revolt. We 
	all write the songs, we're interested 
	in anything about disorder, chaos, 
	especially activity which seems to 
	have no meaning... I think when you 
	make peace with authority, you become 
	authority.

		JOURNALIST 1
	Can you define that a little more?

		JIM
	Yeah you can call us erotic 
	politicians I guess.

								DISSOLVING OVER:

		JOURNALIST 2
	Do you really consider yourself a 
	shaman Mr. Morrison?

								DISSOLVING OVER:

		JIM
	...a scapegoat maybe -- I take on 
	the audiences' fantasies, obeying 
	their impulses. When the impulses 
	are destructive, I'm destructive. 
	It's kinda like sucking the puss out 
	of a rattlesnake, something like 
	that.

		JOURNALIST 1
		(smiling)
	...like a medicine man or witch 
	doctor?

		RAY
		(cuts in)
	Jim said to me once, the history of 
	rock and roll's like Greek drama or 
	caveman stories. The audience comes 
	to see ancient rituals in ancient 
	caves. Their souls in jeopardy. 
	They're not watching any longer, 
	they're participating -- and 
	everything's in play, your life, 
	your death...

		JOURNALIST 1
		(glib)
	Is that why they scream so much?

Gentle laughter. The JOURNALISTS don't get it... panning 
their looks. The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP, dreamy hazy, Warhol-
like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom 
cloud.

									DISSOLVING TO:

		JOURNALIST 3
		(more down to earth)
	Mr. Morrison, how do you feel about 
	being called the "ultimate barbie 
	doll".

On Jim -- a beat. A sickly smile spreads.

		JIM
	I guess when you say something like 
	that, it's a shortcut to thinking.

		JOURNALIST 3
	Then do you "think" about the dreadful 
	reviews your new poetry book has 
	gotten?

Holding up a copy of "The Lords and New Creatures".

		JIM
		(softly)
	I guess they didn't understand.

		JOURNALIST 3
		(having scored)
	And it's true you financed it's 
	publication?

Jim motions him over, whispers something at SIDDONS who goes 
to fetch a pair of scissors.

		RAY
		(angry)
	Have you bothered to read the poetry 
	ma'm? You keep denying that anything 
	good can come from L.A., I mean isn't 
	that kind of a provincial attitude? 
	That Bob Dylan's the only poet cause 
	he's from the East Coast, but you 
	won't even look past Jim's goddamn 
	looks at the words man!

		JIM
		(embarrassed)
	Hey c'mon Ray, hate should be allowed.

		JOURNALIST 1
	...but what really are your songs 
	about Mr. Morrison? You preach, 
	"saving the planet", "making a new 
	age" but how does drinking, taking 
	drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic 
	stance at the world influence young 
	people in a positive way?

		JIM
	I like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" -- 
	you're a word man, but how does your 
	newspaper influence young people to 
	think about Vietnam? Who's sending 
	the soldiers over there to die? The 
	establishment -- right? Your newspaper -- 
	right? That seems to me a lot more 
	dangerous than the stuff we do.

								DISSOLVING OVER:

		JOURNALIST 3
	Do you believe in drugs Mr. Morrison?

SIDDONS comes back in, hands Jim a pair of scissors.

		JIM
		(graciously disdainful)
	Did you know Nietzsche said, "all 
	good consciousness, all evidence of 
	truth comes only from the senses"? 
	Hey you wanna arm wrestle? Come on, 
	you look pretty tough today. C'mon, 
	I'll take you all on.

		JOURNALIST 3
		(ignoring his smile)
	And alcohol? Is that considered part 
	of the shaman's wisdom?

		JIM
	Part of the clown's wisdom -- it's 
	kinda the American way. You know we 
	spend more on alcohol and tobacco 
	than on education.

DOUBLE IMAGES on the DISSOLVES.

		JOURNALIST 3
	Are you by any chance in a trance 
	now Mr. Morrison?

		JIM
	Do you hurt?

		JOURNALIST 3
	What?

		JIM
	What hurts you the most?

He cuts his hair with the scissors. A commotion.

		JOURNALIST 3
	What are you doing?

								DISSOLVING OVER:

		JIM
	Uh... got tired of the barbie doll 
	look. It hurt.

		JOURNALIST 3
	Are you serious?

		JIM
		(cutting hair blindly)
	About? Y'know when people are joking, 
	I find they are dead serious and 
	when they're dead serious, I find 
	them funny.

They're amazed. The point is made however -- visibly. The 
anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained -- the 
cynosure of all eyes as always. Eyes shooting back at 
JOURNALIST 3... JOURNALIST 4 cuts in from the back of the 
room altering the mood.

		JOURNALIST 4
	What do your parents think about 
	what you are doing?

		JIM
		(pause)
	Actually, I don't really remember 
	being born. It musta happened during 
	one of my blackouts.

Laughter. JOURNALIST 4 with dark hair and demeanor, gypsy-
like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing, large 
glasses, is probably a rock magazine writer but seems to 
like Jim and his work.

		JOURNALIST 4
	But they must've expressed some 
	feeling?

		JIM
		(pause)
	Well, to be honest they're not living 
	anymore so I don't like to talk about 
	that.

Flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment.

		JOURNALIST 4
	Could you at least tell us how they 
	died?

Jim puts the scissors down, going to a low mysterious voice.

		JIM
	Oh, it was a... horrible car crash... 
	in the desert in the fifties, 
	Arizona... ran right into a truckload 
	of Indians... Navajos, they were 
	lying out on the road, all bleeding, 
	and I was with my Grandma and Grandad, 
	we were banged up and all... and I 
	was looking at my Dad and he was 
	lying there... but his throat was 
	severed and there was air coming 
	out.

He puts the room in a hush. He has mesmerized them and they're 
not sure whether to believe it or not.

		JOURNALIST 4
	I'm sorry.

		JOURNALIST 2
	I have the feeling I'm being put on.

Jim rises, staggers slightly as he makes his way to the bar 
on the way out of the room, smiles right at her, ignoring 
everybody else in the room.

		JIM
	Y'all believe what you want to 
	believe, you will anyway... but it 
	does kinda show you what excites 
	people?
		(looking directly at 
		her)
	Fear, pity, horror -- all those good 
	things that count. It's sorta I guess 
	like being on the edge of an orgasm, 
	y'know... that mystery just before 
	you come. When? If? Should I? Will 
	you die for me, eat me, this way, 
	the end...

He goes. The room in silence, embarrassed, nervous titters 
looking at Journalist 4 who flushes deeply as we cut to:

INT. PATRICIA'S SOHO LOFT - THAT DAY (RAIN)

Rain, rain, rain... pelting the large windows as we glide to 
JIM fucking JOURNALIST 4 (PATRICIA KENNEALY) madly in the 
twisted sheets...

He gives up, exhausted. The SONG CRYSTAL SHIP backbeats the 
scene...

He wanders around her place. Her place is crammed with books 
and intellectualabilia, skulls, candles, globes of the world, 
plants. She puts her glasses back on.

		PATRICIA
	You want to do some more cocaine? 
	It'll loosen you up.

		JIM
	Great! A new thing.

As she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of 
champagne and a basketful of items all catered by Jim. He's 
at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript.

		JIM
	Wow how old is this?

INSERT -- the DRAWINGS in the book pertain to Witchcraft.

		PATRICIA
		(snorting)
	14th Century. I practice the Craft.

		JIM
	The Craft?

		PATRICIA
	I'm a witch
		(smiles)
	A white one.

		JIM
		(impressed)
	Wow! You Patricia? Who would've 
	guessed?

Ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and 
demeanor. She looks back at him, challenging.

		PATRICIA
	The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains 
	and pre-Christian shamans when your 
	Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a 
	minor Scottish clan founded by a 
	bastard son of the king of Norway.

JIM reappraising her. Her eye contact is very direct.

		PATRICIA
	It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches 
	are the protectors of the seasons, 
	the harvests, goddesses of the grain. 
	And when crossed, destroyers.

Jim waits. Something in the feeling of the room has shifted. 
The sound of her razor chopping coke. He snorts -- the first 
time.

		PATRICIA
	You ever try drinking blood?

		JIM
	What?

		PATRICIA
	It works you know. You drink blood 
	the right time of the moon... they 
	used to dance in the forests naked. 
	I think that's what offended the 
	Puritans and led to the Burnings. 
	They were a sexual threat to their 
	male order like the Bacchae -- five 
	days a year for Dionysus, they used 
	to wander the hills in ancient Greece, 
	the first witches, clans of wild 
	women fucking, looting, eating animals 
	raw, the wine in their blood running 
	hot -- looking for Dionysus... to 
	tear him to pieces -- isn't that 
	wild?

Jim is down on his knees crawling around her. She is crawling 
back.

		JIM
		(hooked)
	Where do you get the blood?

Patricia laughs.

										SUPERIMPOSITION TO:

PATRICIA drawing blood from her arm -- wipes it on his mouth. 
Some of it spills out, tamping the white powder with red 
stains. Jim watching enthralled, coked out. She hands him 
the jewelled Moroccan dagger.

		PATRICIA
	Blood is the rose of mysterious union, 
	symbol of potency... now you.

		JIM
	No... I don't like... cutting myself.

		PATRICIA
		(stern)
	Don't be such a child! If I do it, 
	you have to do it.

He extends his arm. The look between them. He closes his 
eyes like a little boy. She makes the cut.

DOORS SONG 
Before you slip into unconsciousness 
I'd like to have another kiss 
Another flashing chance at bliss 
Another kiss, another kiss

						SUPERIMPOSITIONS:

Candles, incense burn. As Jim and Patricia dance in the loft 
naked to music, drinking champagne.

JUMP CUT: He is chasing her with one of her goat horns between 
his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale.

						SUPERIMPOSITIONS TO:

They're fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft, bathed 
in blood and white powder all over the place, rain pelting 
the windows, thunder, Orff's "Carmina Burana" cutting in 
over the Doors' song.

		PATRICIA
		(sexy)
	Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me 
	good.

In slightly ape-like SLOW MOTION, he's wildly thrusting at 
her like a stallion, then reaches down, yanks out her 
diaphragm -- holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it across 
the room into the fireplace.

		JIM
		(lips out of sync)
	I'm gonna burn you down.

		PATRICIA
	Come on...

Incants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS.

Jim is wild, reaching for the Moroccan dagger, holding it to 
her face as he continues to pump.

		PATRICIA
	Cut me! Cut me go on!

		JIM
		(knife to her cheek)
	Nobody'd ever look at you again -- 
	'cept me. I'd scar you forever.

		PATRICIA
	Yeah YEAH!

		JIM
	AWRIGHT! AWRIGHT!

		PATRICIA
	FUCK ME! FUCK ME!! GO ON FUCK ME!!!

DOORS SONG 
The crystal ship is being filled 
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills 
A million ways to spend your time 
When we get back I'll drop a line

The camera shooting up to the ceiling in a tilting dutch 
angle as the world comes unglued. Jim yelling with release.

										DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - NEW YORK - ANOTHER DAY

GLORIA STAVERS, beautiful 30ish ex-Vogue model shooting Jim 
for her layout. It's not going well. He's resisting, the 
attitude negative to be photographed, compounded by the acid 
it seems he's on.

		GLORIA
	Take off your shirt.

		JIM
		(cow noise)
	Mooooooo!!!

		GLORIA
		(taking his shirt off)
	You remind me of a Russian peasant. 
	I see you standing in a wheat field. 
	The pride, the arrogance. You love 
	to look at yourself don't you. You 
	love yourself.
		(he's moving, getting 
		into it)
	...good... big cat stalking...

JUMP CUTS -- photos going off... JIM starting to pout 
narcistically, Jagger-like, for camera -- a bare-chested 
pose, long lion's mane of hair streaming down to his 
shoulders. She's shooting rapidly talking him thru the trip. 
Her sentences falling on separate cuts of Jim. As we hear 
the backbeat of PEOPLE ARE STRANGE.

		GLORIA
	...the camera is like a roulette 
	wheel Jim. It becomes whoever you 
	want it to be -- a woman you want to 
	seduce, a man you want to kill, a 
	mother you want to upset, a wife you 
	want to lie to or love, whatever you 
	want it to be, it is...

		JIM
		(pausey, paranoid)
	Where are the Doors.

He resists, he goes with it, push pull, prowling her loft on 
the acid, a bottle of cognac in one hand -- changing from 
shot to shot like a chameleon, free, wild, vicious, obscene.

		GLORIA
	Forget the Doors. It's you they want, 
	Jim. You're the Doors.

		JIM
		(scared suddenly)
	We do everything together.

		GLORIA
	You control the audience, like dogs, 
	manipulate them Jim, one picture can 
	control a million people, be anything 
	you want -- growl at them, be ugly, 
	be frightened, be selfish. Be man, 
	woman, whild, animal. Live, die, 
	return again. Anything you want. 
	Everything is permitted.

A weird dance ensuing between them -- teasing, enticing. He 
runs away, writhes along her wall, being photographed inch 
by moving inch. He crawls to her. She gets down with him on 
the floor, straddling him, photographing. Then he straddles 
her as she shoots him from her back. They kiss, flirting. He 
growls like an animal... dives into her closet... tearing 
open the doors, flinging away hanging clothes, he finds her 
white fur coat and puts it on... JUMP CUT -- him as he moves 
to her full-length MIRROR, contorting himself. She slides up 
behind him.

		GLORIA
	Go on look at yourself, fall in love 
	with yourself. You're your own 
	audience now Jim. They want you. 
	Worship and love and adore you...

A pause. She wants him. No longer so cool.

		GLORIA
	...Jim Morrison, the god of Rock and 
	Cock...

		JIM
	I am the snake and you are the lute

		GLORIA
	Exactly...

Our camera dwells on Jim in the mirror, closer, closer -- 
the image and the reality, which is which anymore -- where 
does it end?

The Great Jim Morrison, The Shaman, then Pamela, Patricia, 
Gloria, a series of women who face after face fill the ancient 
gallery, interchangeable masks as PEOPLE ARE STRANGE climaxes 
and JIM's face SPINS OUT OPTICALLY TO:

DOORS SONG 
People are strange when you're a stranger 
Faces look ugly when you're alone 
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted 
Streets are uneven when you're down

LIMBO - MAGAZINE COVERS

JIM'S FACE on a series of MAGAZINES twirling -- "SIXTEEN", 
"GLAMOUR", ROCK MAGAZINES, etc. flowering out into:

INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT (WINTER)

Style vampires drink and grope and drug and dance under the 
staccato blips of strobe lights. Artists and intellectuals, 
groupies and debutantes, everyone on display, as contrived 
and replicated as one of the Warhol prints of Elvis or Marilyn 
and Mao on the walls...

FISHEYE POVS -- hearkening back to the acid trip -- as JIM 
wanders through the dream, drinking, smoking, swallowing 
pills. PEOPLE look at him, talk to him (AD LIBS) but drugs 
distort everything and their voices are foreign, incoherent 
and they disappear. "PEOPLE ARE STRANGE" continuing:

DOORS SONG 
When you're strange 
Faces come out of the rain 
When you're strange 
No one remembers your name 
When you're strange 
When you're strange 
When you're strange

INT. ROOM - LIMBO

Jim peering into a room somewhere -- one of Warhol's FILMS 
is playing on a wall -- a man sleeping, eating...

A GLIMPSE OF VIETNAM WAR FOOTAGE on a TV monitor -- B-52s 
dropping bombs.

A fat little PR MAN grabbing Jim's arm, leaning in, distorted.

		PR MAN
		(cool)
	You must meet Andy Warhol, Jim. He's 
	more than an artist. Andy is art. 
	Bright people in America wonder -- 
	does Andy imitate life, or does life 
	imitate Andy. The meeting of two 
	kings. Yes, Come.

PAMELA is suddenly there, laughing, nuttily introducing a 
handsome strapping TOM BAKER, a charismatic actor, and a 
COUNT, suave, urbane, on heroin. Her voice lost in the jabber -- 
their names sound as if they're in a bottom of a tank. PAMELA 
seems so impressed with the high life of New York.

		PAMELA
	Oh Jim this is Tom... Baker, he's an 
	actor, he was in Andy's movie and 
	this is Count Ruspoli. He lives in 
	Paris, but he's Italian. He's from a 
	very famous family over there. They're 
	seven hundred years old.

		COUNT
		(Italian accent)
	Hi Jim, you are great... I see you 
	at Ondine's with Bobby and Jimmy. 
	It...

PR guy stays there, introduces himself to the count.

		PAM
		(pawing at Jim)
	Don't you like the way he talks. 
	Isn't he cool?

		JIM
		(annoyed with Pam)
	Yeah... hey what's your trip?

		TOM
		(cutting in)
	Saw your gig at 'The Scene'. Hot... 
	very hot... You strung out? Here. 
	Try this.
		(pill, popper, joint, 
		a drink, all at once)

		JIM
	Love your movies man. What a great 
	penis...

Tom is obviously a major druggie. A popper -- joint trade-
off going off.

RAY's face leaning in distorted.

		RAY
	Come on, we're splitting man. 
	Dorothy's waiting at the door. We'll 
	get a bite at Max's and...

		JIM
	You can't leave. Where's your will 
	to be weird man?

JOHN DENSMORE appearing with a wasted looking ROBBIE who is 
giggling, high, and with a NEW GIRLFRIEND in tow.

		JOHN
	Get outta here man. This is fucking 
	weird man.

The PR MAN is still next to Jim, jumping up and down excitedly 
waving across the room at nothing in particular. As the 
PHOTOGRAPHERS try to get Jim and the Doors in a photo 
opportunity.

		PR MAN
	Right this way Jim. Andy's in the 
	bedroom.

		JIM
		(to RAY)
	Don't go, y'see Norman Mailer, I 
	hear he's here?

		RAY
	Yeah can we meet him, he's great... 
	just like he is.
		(enamored)
	You wanna meet him?

		JIM
		(paranoid)
	I don't know... did he know who you 
	were?

		RAY
	Yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's 
	your hero!

		JIM
	Nah... later...

A wasted, emaciated Edie Sedgewick type floats into Jim's 
fractured POV -- introducing a MAN with a crew cut and silk 
suit.

		EDIE
		(echoey voice)
	Hey Jim, this is Jake Johnson, you 
	remember Jake Johnson -- the 
	astronaut, he's just got back from 
	outer space.

		JAKE JOHNSON
	I like the Doors, I like the Doors, 
	I like the Doors.

		JIM
	I like outer space.

Tom Baker brings a tall, incredible looking BLONDE in black 
leather towards him.

		TOM
	Hey where's my joint?
		(a roach goes back)
	There's this chick sings with the 
	Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She 
	says she can drink you under the 
	table.

They stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares 
that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent.

		NICO
	I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some 
	of us are going downtown to a new 
	club. You want to come?

A voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim.

		TOM
		(distantly heard)
	...elevate your taste in trolls man.

		JIM
		(to Nico who reaches 
		for her vodka)
	Vodka? Race you.

		NICO
	Your death...

		JIM
		(to Ray and Robbie)
	Wanna go?... Come on let's go.

		ROBBIE
	She looks too freaky to me.

		NICO
	Wait just a minute.

As she floats away.

		JIM
	Come on there's pussy Robbie.

		ROBBIE
		(excited)
	Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants 
	to be alone.

Lynne is there, pretty, nods to Jim.

		RAY
	Come on Jim, let's go.

		JIM
		(childlike)
	Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol?

		JOHN
	Tell you the truth, I can live without 
	him. He's a freak. Let's get outta 
	here. We got a show tomorrow.

		JIM
	Come on man! I thought we were gonna 
	be a band, the four of us -- and 
	party all night, rock and roll!

		RAY
		(laughs)
	I could never keep up with you Jim. 
	I couldn't make the music.

Jim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French 
Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent, 
nothing meant but a moment...

		JIM
		(desperate mockery, 
		grabs Ray)
	Don't go. Don't leave! You can't 
	leave. I don't know what will happen. 
	It might be Death.

		RAY
	Come on Jim, this isn't our scene, 
	these people are vampires. We gotta 
	stick together man, the four of us. 
	Let's make the myths man.

A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's 
shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As 
if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the 
same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there, 
across the room, waving.

The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner. 
Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off. 
Jim forgets he saw the Indian.

		PR MAN
	Right here Jim, right here. Andy's 
	waiting. You know what you have in 
	common is uniqueness.

Past more faces. The Music has subtly shifted to STRANGE 
DAYS somewhere along the way.

DOORS SONG 
Strange days have found us 
Strange days have tracked us down 
They're going to destroy 
Our casual joys 
We shall go on playing or find a new town

Past a cache of QUEENS in white leather ogling Jim, one of 
them coming over boldly, chatting him up (AD LIB dimly heard), 
them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. Jim rearing back, 
laughing but wary. Past the RICH LADIES dripping with jewels 
and faces peeled from Brazilian sleep tanks and Swiss knives.

Past a YOUNG MAN dressed in Jim Morrison leather pants with 
his hair and eye make-up, a warped image of Jim, smiling 
back at him.

		JIM
		(looking for Nico)
	Nico!

INT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

A quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading 
JIM, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn 
across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus 
clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN 
ARISTOCRATS looking so cool.

		WARHOL
	Well, it was such a big opening, we 
	just had to go to Philadelphia, 
	y'know, you were supposed to, mmm...

		PR GUY
		(butting in)
	Andy! Andy!

ANDY turning at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo 
doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like 
a teddy bear.

Slightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim -- 
a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW 
MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his 
story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER.

		ANDY
	...but so many people showed up, the 
	paintings were getting crushed, so 
	they took them all down... um, it 
	really looked great y'know... maybe 
	uhhh...
		(long pause)

		PR MAN
		(cutting in)
	...the walls. The blank walls. Andy 
	was the art. Should do a show. Just 
	walls. Today it's really about people, 
	not what they do. It's the astronaut 
	that matters, not the voyage, the 
	actor, not the movie -- how do I 
	say, it's the trip, not arriving.

Andy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy.

		PR MAN
		(babbling on)
	...you know what Andy says, some day 
	everybody's gonna be famous for 15 
	seconds, but it won't mean anything.

		BAKER
	That's too short. I need a coupla 
	hours.

They laugh. Andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam.

		ANDY
	We'd just love to have you in our 
	movies Jim, you're so beautiful, 
	you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... 
	this is for you Jim.

Andy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's 
carrying.

		ANDY
	Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, 
	I could talk to God with this. But I 
	don't really have anything to say. 
	So... mmmm now you can talk to God. 
	Oh hi!

Vanishes, waving to somebody else. Jim holding the phone.

DOORS SONG 
Strange days have found us 
And through their strange hours 
We linger alone

Nico reappears waving at him to come quickly.

		NICO
	Morrison!

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT (WINTER)

SNOW on the streets... a group of DRUGGIES staggering in the 
snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing 
puffs of cold air...

Jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on 
it.

IRIS SHOTS continue -- PAMELA laughing battily with TOM BAKER 
who's putting the make on her... The COUNT is on heroin.

JIM passing a vodka bottle back and forth with NICO hitting 
a stash of ups. They fall in the snow, mad Russian winter.

DOORS SONG 
Bodies confused 
Memories misused 
As we run from the day 
To a strange night of stone 
(SONG REPEATS OVER)

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR (REGENCY) - THAT NIGHT

BLACK &amp; WHITE IRIS SHOTS continue -- imagistic, 
disassociative.

A LONG CORRIDOR -- COUPLE staggering down the red carpets, 
champagne bottles in hand. The COUNT gets lost.

PAM laughing -- suddenly alone, notices, goes looking for 
Jim... floating down this endless corridor with white doors 
and red carpet.

INT. ELEVATOR

NICO stripping... a superb body... riding the floors...

Jim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... Nico with 
that crazed German laugh... PAMELA pushing the elevator 
buttons wildly...

The elevator opening on her. From Pamela's POV -- Nico down 
on her knees, her blonde head buried in Jim's leather pants... 
Jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes 
barely registering Pam... who screams loud and long, hiding 
his eyes... not wanting to know... The images faster and 
more fragmented: Pam beating at Jim wildly. He's laughing. 
Nico's laughing. The Aristocrats in the hallway are laughing. 
The world is laughing with its madness.

DOORS SONG 
Strange days have found us 
Strange days have tracked us down

INT. NEW HAVEN CONCERT HALL - NIGHT (1967)

An eager rowdy CROWD chants DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! to a 
stage without the Doors. TECHIES are moving amplifiers, 
running sound checks, stalling time, the MANAGER SIDDONS 
gauging the crowd, nervous. RICH GIRLS and LOCAL HONCHOS 
have backstage passes. COPS crawling over the stage, the 
PROMOTER of the concert trying to get the crowds attention.

		TECHIE
		(at mike)
	Testing one-two-three. Testing.

		PROMOTER
		(on mike)
	Look, the Fire Marshall's not gonna 
	let the show go on. Either you go 
	back to your seats, you go to the 
	aisle, you don't do that -- no show!

		CROWD
		(pushing towards stage, 
		no aisles)
	DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!
		(turning to)
	MORRISON! MORRISON! MORRISON!

INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

The SOUNDS of the CROWD pound thru the hallway. CAMERA 
following JIM reading a magazine article, accompanied by 
PATRICIA KENNEALY -- past the TECHIES, turning to look -- 
they go into empty SHOWER ROOM.

INT. SHOWER ROOM - SAME NIGHT

The Crowd NOISE still carries, echoing. JIM leads PATRICIA 
to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. Tapping 
the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads.

		JIM
	"Lord Byron"? Really. You think? You 
	like the poems?

		PATRICIA
	Like? I loved them! "Mad bad and 
	dangerous to know." That's what they 
	said about him. Your poems should be 
	taken as seriously.

		JIM
	These are the kindest words I've 
	ever heard in my life. No one has 
	ever understood. Thank you.
		(then)
	Maybe I should always fuck my critics.

		PATRICIA
	Y'know I don't even like rockers. 
	They're sleazy. I made up my fuck 
	list the other night -- out of 30 
	guys there were maybe three of them, 
	y'know. I'm not a groupie.

		JIM
		(hotter, grabs her)
	Let's do it, here, now... with the 
	sound of the crowd. Like Nuremberg, 
	wild German fucking.

		PATRICIA
	You like that hunh? Beg!

		JIM
	I'm begging! I'm begging you!

		PATRICIA
	You wanna fuck me, Morrison, don't 
	ever lie to me again. Ever!

		JIM
	About what!

		PATRICIA
	Your father. Why do you tell me 
	bullshit like your father's dead?

		JIM
		(pissed)
	What's your problem with fathers! 
	They're dead, both of them, I told 
	you.

		PATRICIA
	If he's so dead, then who answered 
	the phone when I called the house?

Jim -- a look, struck.

		PATRICIA
		(knowing look)
	You didn't really think you'd get 
	away with that, Morrison. An Admiral 
	in the United States Navy. Who's at 
	the Gulf of Tonkin when Vietnam 
	starts. Your Dad's a Deputy Chief of 
	Operations.

		JIM
	What'd he say? That was really stupid. 
	Why didn't you just ask me.

		PATRICIA
	Well naturally he wasn't too happy 
	when I called. Your Mom wanted to 
	talk but he shut her off.

		JIM
	You're a fuckin' cunt. You could 
	ruin his career if...

		PATRICIA
	What, I'm a "fuckin' cunt" because I 
	called the house? Like it's hard to 
	trace your school records. University 
	of Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
	Arlington, Virginia, Washington, 
	D.C. Brother, sister, it's seven 
	miles long baby -- it's all in the 
	"The End", it's so easy.

Fingering his pants, her hand slips inside. Teasing, 
dominating him. Her dark side radiant.

		PATRICIA
	Don't ever try to hide anything from 
	me again. Okay? Go on... tell me. 
	Did he make you cut your hair? Did 
	he hit you, was he a bully? Did he 
	love you? How much?

Jim describes a small space between thumb and forefinger.

		PATRICIA
	And your mother?

Jim makes a little larger space.

		JIM
		(pause)
	I don't want to talk about it. Hate 
	is a very underestimated emotion.

His look is right at her. Silence. Patricia knows he won't 
talk. Through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigger 
and bigger -- "MORRISON MORRISON MORRISON!" She's excited, 
wanting to make love here, now. He's cooled out, however.

		PATRICIA
	It doesn't matter anymore does it. 
	Listen to them. It's you they want 
	now. Not the Doors, not your mother 
	or your father's child... They want 
	you Jim.

Jim shakes his head, weary. Suddenly he's scared inside.

		JIM
	You're wrong. What they want I can't 
	give... my death -- ripped to pieces -- 
	do you feel their power?
		(the noise pounding)

		PATRICIA
	You have no choice, Jim. I see you 
	up there like Icarus. I see you flying 
	closer and closer to the sun. And 
	your wings are melting...

		JIM
	I want to live, Patricia. I don't 
	wanna die.

Jim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. Laden with a power to 
which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she 
pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him. 
Shaking his head.

		JIM
	Patricia... Patricia...

A beefy COP stands there looking at them,

		COP
	Whatcha doing there?

		JIM
	Uh... nuthin'

		COP
		(approaching, 
		suspicious)
	Okay, outta there both of you. No 
	one's allowed backstage. Let's go.

		PATRICIA
	You idiot, don't you know who...

		JIM
	Hey, I'm with the band man. It's 
	cool. Take it easy.

THE COP has no patience, grabs JIM by the arm and pulls. JIM 
shoves him off. THE COP pushes back. A shoving match.

		COP
	Let's go. NOW! You're both under 
	arrest.

		JIM
		(pointing to his 
		crotch, angry)
	Hey, eat it man!

The cop whips out a black can from his belt, sprays Jim.

		JIM
	Mace! Shit!
		(in pain)

Patricia screaming at the COP grabs JIM, propelling him 
violently out the stall of the bathroom.

INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

		PATRICIA
	Help! They got Jim!!!

		JIM
	Why'd you blind me man? You blinded 
	me!

SIDDONS and RAY running up with ROADIES and OTHERS.

		SIDDONS
	What the hell happened!
		(to Jim)
	Don't touch Jim. Get some water. 
	Don't touch your eyes.

		JIM
		(in pain)
	I BEEN BLINDED MAN. I BEEN MACED.

		COP
		(realizing)
	Hey all he said was...

		SIDDONS
	He was WHAT! He's Jim Morrison for 
	chrissake. Jim, Jim -- you okay -- 
	let's get you under the water here. 
	Don't touch, you'll be okay.

COP 2 comes up.

		COP 1
	I'm going to have to issue a warrant 
	for his arrest.

		SIDDONS
	Are you NUTS!
		(blocking them)

JIM guided back into the shower stall by his entourage, eyes 
blind as Oedipus, starts to laugh. A black Irish laugh.

Ray looking on PATRICIA in the hallway. A beat, senses what 
happened.

		RAY
	Why don't you leave him alone lady, 
	he doesn't need more shit in his 
	life.

		PATRICIA
	What do you know what Jim needs?

A precise military Drum Beat hits as we launch into "The 
Unknown Soldier".

DOORS SONG 
...Hup two -- three -- four... 
COMPANY HALT!

INT. NEW HAVEN STAGE - THAT NIGHT

THE DOORS on stage, JIM - eyes masked, facing death at a 
mock execution, in full black leather armor.

DOORS SONG 
Present arms!...

The famous drum roll, tension building. Sudden sound of 
guitar. Jim crumples to the ground. Blood shooting from his 
mouth.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Make a grave for the unknown soldier 
	Nestled in your hollow shoulder 
	The unknown soldier 
	Practice as the news is read 
	Television children dead 
	Bullet strikes the helmet's head 
	It's all over 
	The war is over!

The audience is enrapt. Jim suddenly jumps up, looses the 
blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs 
into Willie Dixon's BACK DOOR MAN.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	OH YEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! 
	AYYYYYYAAAAAMMMMAAA BACK DOOR MAN.

The FANS go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as 
he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. INSTAMATICS 
flashing rapidly as the KIDS press forward at Jim fondling 
the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Well the men don't know 
	But the little girls unnerstan'...

Joints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked. 
A TEENAGE BOY &amp; GIRL make a break thru the cordon of COPS at 
the front of the stage, heading for Jim. The Cops chase them 
down mid-stage, and wrestle them back to the edge -- throwing 
them back into the audience.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	When all the good people are trying 
	to sleep 
	I'm out there making my midnight 
	creep 
	Yeah, cause I'm a backdoor man 
	The men don't know 
	But the little girls unnerstan'...

Danger fills the air, electric. Jim strutting, Indian like, 
up to one of the Cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it 
to the Crowd, which roars with approval. A couple Cops looking 
at Jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how. 
They shuffle and look offstage for direction. Their apparent 
impotence brings redoubled jeering from the Kids.

RAY, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a 
look with JOHN as they head into the instrumental break in 
the song. There's something different about Jim -- more 
demonic, more driven -- a spirit has taken him over.

RAY'S POV -- JIM catching his look, but no recognition in 
those eyes. They're dark pools, like Warhol's eyes. He turns 
away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping 
improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter.

		JIM
	I wanna tell you 'bout something 
	that happened just a few minutes ago 
	right here in New Haven. This is New 
	Haven isn't it? New Haven, 
	Connecticut, United States of America?

The CROWD yells in acknowledgement, one stoned TEENAGER naked 
from the waist up and ripped on beer, yelling out.

		HECKLER
	HEY MORRISON, is the West really the 
	best or are you just stoned on 
	weeeeeedddddd??????

		VOICE'S
		(annoying)
	"Light My Fire". Sing "Light My Fire". 
	Yeah. Give us Light My Fire!...
		(giggles)
	We want Mick Jagger! Take your clothes 
	off Jim. Show it to us! We want the 
	Lizard King!

Jim ignores it, sits on the stage, lights a cigarette. Long 
pause, tension building. Their catcalls for "Light My Fire" 
die out as Jim faces them down. They wait... not knowing 
what happens next.

		JIM
		(finally)
	Well I was with this girl backstage, 
	y'know. We got to talking and we 
	wanted some privacy, so we went into 
	this shower stall. We weren't doin' 
	anything y'know jes' standing there 
	and talking.

The AUDIENCE laughing, the band continuing to play, John 
adding emphasis to Jim's words with various shots and rolls. 
Camera moving over the crowd picking out the KIDS, sensing 
the anarchy dormant in their faces.

		JIM
	...and then this little man came in 
	there, this little man in a little 
	blue suit and a little blue cap...

More COPS turning to face Jim from front stage, getting the 
point now. RAY sees it coming...

		JIM
		(redneck voice)
	And he said -- "Whatcha doin' there?" 
	I said, "nuthin'" and he said, "Well 
	you better get outta there or..." 
	"Or what" I asked him...

The AUDIENCE has now grown deadly silent. Nearly every cop 
is facing JIM as he uses his dumb Southerner voice. RAY's 
eyes warning JIM.

		JIM
	And he started pushing me and I pushed 
	back and he didn't like that so he 
	reached back there and got out his 
	little can of mace. And sprayed it 
	right in my eyes. And blinded me. 
	Why? Cause I was alone in a room 
	with a lady doing what he would like 
	to be doing if he could ever get it 
	up without a gun.

The LIGHTS coming on suddenly, the AUDIENCE seething. Shouts 
of "Fuck em! Right on!"

		JIM
	In the United States of America. 
	Land of the free. Home of the Brave 
	man -- in God We Trust right? TURN 
	OFF THE LIGHTS.

CROWD roars. A POLICE LIEUTENANT in his 50's, grey hair, 
beefy, marches out onto the stage, standing next to Jim, 
arms akimbo. A SECOND COP joins him.

Ray rolling the music out into a silence as Jim sticks the 
mike in the officer's face, defiantly.

		JIM
	Say your thing man!

More cops come out, snatch the microphone, as Jim flashes 
the audience a "touchy aren't they?" shrug.

		LIEUTENANT
	Young man you've gone too far. The 
	show's over. You're under arrest.

TWO more COPS moving on Jim, pinning both his arms and 
dragging him off stage.

		JOHN
		(scared)
	They're gonna beat the shit out of 
	him man!

RAY moving to intercede with SIDDONS and ROADIES.

		JIM
		(resisting)
	HEY... HEY! HEY!

Ray and Siddons are pushed aside by other cops. The crowd is 
going nuts. Chairs are thrown. Kids rushing onto the stage 
where the Cops beat them back.

ANNE is writing it all down on her notepad. A certain 
satisfaction and joy at the unfolding of this event.

INT. BACKSTAGE STAIRCASE - SAME NIGHT

JIM is dragged roughly down a flight of stairs.

		JIM
	GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME SLAVE!

EXT. ARENA PARKING LOT - SAME NIGHT

JIM is wrestled across the lot, pinned to the car and 
handcuffed, punched and thrown into the car, yelling. 
Journalists try to intercede, one is also arrested.

		JIM
	YOU'RE SLAVES. YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF 
	SLAVES. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME 
	MAN, THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU!!!

INT. HOLDING ROOM - POLICE STATION - THAT NIGHT

JIM is spreadeagled against the wall, a dignified, defiant 
look on his face.

		COP 1
		(coming in)
	Hey whatcha got here? A boy or a 
	girl?

		COP 2
		(coming closer to Jim)
	What do you care. You're gonna fuck 
	him anyway... Okay rock star, let's 
	see the backdoor you keep bawling 
	about.
		(stretching his ass 
		cheeks)
	Where's the roach powder?

		COP 1
	Ain't he the prettiest long-haired 
	boy y'ever saw?

		COP 2
		(reaching for a can)
	Turn around rock star.

As Jim defiantly does so, Cop 2 looses a big cloud of roach 
powder into his long hair.

		COP 2
		(backing off)
	Stand clear, who the hell knows what's 
	living in there?

All during this, snickering laughter from the onlooking half-
dozen POLICE OFFICERS gathered to watch. Jim waits, then 
with great claim, in a quiet voice:

		JIM
	You finished? You sure you're 
	finished? Haven't you forgotten 
	something -- the consolation prize 
	they gave ya for taking your cock 
	and balls? The guns. Why don't you 
	use em you withered dicks! You shit-
	eating red-neck chickenshit bastards, 
	I hope this makes your worthless 
	lives...

As he's smacked by COP 2, sending him sprawling into the 
wall...

		JIM
		(on the floor, quiet)
	You better kill me cause I'm gonna 
	come back and fuck everyone of your 
	daughters...

EXT. POLICE STATION - THAT NIGHT

A SNOWBALL smashes against the glass. COPS coming out with 
sticks.

A RIOT brewing. A HUNDRED TEENAGERS sallying back and forth 
on the sidewalk, taunting the cops. A dozen of them have 
already been arrested.

		KIDS
	LET JIM GO!!! MORRISON! MORRISON! WE 
	WANT MORRISON!

		COPS
	GET OUTTA HERE! GO HOME. GO ON NOW!

COPS chase the KIDS with sticks. But just as it looks like 
it's going to get out of hand, JIM appears at the doors of 
the station, stepping out between RAY and the DOORS and 
SIDDONS. He signals his freedom, arms in the air.

		CROWD
	MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON!

Jim waves, does a small pained victory jig in front of the 
thwarted Gestapo, ribcage and spleen hurting.

		CROWD
	JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM...

		RAY
		(aside to Robbie)
	He could go all the way man! In five 
	years he could be in the White House. 
	Another JFK.

Robbie's look tells us he thinks Ray is as much caught up in 
his dreams as Jim.

											CUT TO:

FLASHBULBS hits us full frame as:

INT. MUG SHOT - LIMBO

A reminder of the reality as the thud of a clanking gate 
shuts. MORRISON's profile, disheveled hair -- he glares 
angrily.

FLASH!

FRONTAL SHOT, slated Police Dept -- New Haven Conn -- 23750 -- 
12-10-67. A sullen handsome portrait.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - (LAST SESSION) - LOS ANGELES NIGHT 
(1970)

JIM drinks... an ugly cough. Silence. In this puffy wrack 
and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight 
of the boy amazed and amused by it all. We hear the ghostly 
CROWD still cheering.

		JIM
	I drink so I can talk to assholes. 
	This includes me. Let's just say I 
	was testing the bounds of reality -- 
	that's-all -- I was curious... I 
	kinda always preferred to be hated. 
	Like Erich Von Stroheim in the 
	movies... the man you loved to hate... 
	it's meant to be ironic, courage 
	wants to laugh. Y'know it's 
	essentially a stupid situation. I go 
	out on a stage and I howl for people. 
	In me they see what they want to see -- 
	some say the Lizard King, whatever 
	that means, or some black-clad leather 
	demon whatever that means... but 
	really I think of myself as a 
	sensitive, intelligent human being 
	but with the soul of a clown which 
	always forces me to blow it at the 
	most crucial moment...
		(pause)
	a fake hero... a joke the gods played 
	on me... it's okay, I accept the 
	joke... and smile. Death old friend, 
	death and my cock, I can forgive my 
	injuries in the name of wisdom, 
	luxury, romance. Words got me the 
	wound and will get me well. All join 
	now in lament of my cock, a tongue 
	of knowledge in the feathered night. 
	Boys get crazy in the head and suffer. 
	I sacrifice my cock on the alter of 
	silence.

The ENGINEER looking at him puzzled. Has Jim lost it? MIKE, 
his friend, is there in the Engineer's booth, with the Door's 
SECRETARY, Leticia, and an elegant MYSTERY WOMAN. They're 
smoking dope, partying.

		MIKE
	Hey Jim, how 'bout hitting a strip-
	joint? It's getting late and we can...

		JIM
	Nah, later...

The violent backbeat of THE WASP now picking up.

		JIM
	Now listen to this I'll tell you 
	about Texas Radio and the big beat 
	soft driven slow and mad like some 
	new language reaching your head with 
	the cold sudden fury of a divine 
	messenger let me tell you about 
	heartache and the loss of God 
	wandering, wandering in hopeless 
	night out here on the perimeter there 
	are no stars out here we is stoned, 
	immaculate... but I tell you this: 
	No eternal reward will forgive us 
	now for wasting the dawn.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAWN (1968)

JIM walks the dawn streets. Classic image -- jeans, boots, 
jacket, the sun starting to rise on the smog and translucent 
pink light along Santa Monica Boulevard outside the cheap 
Alta Cienega Motel where he lives... PEACE FROG shoots us 
through.

DOORS SONG 
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven 
Blood stains the roofs and palm trees of Venice 
Blood in my love in the terrible summer 
The bloody red sun of phantastic L.A.

Over the SONG, a MONTAGE of the 60's passing to its darker 
side.

INT. BARNEY'S BEANERY - LOS ANGELES - MONDAY

JIM -- drinking in Barney's Bar.

HEADLINE READS:

"KANSAS COPS SLAM DOORS; CONCERT CANCELLED," 2nd HEADLINE: 
"DOORS 3RD ALBUM OUT, SALES UP, MAGIC DOWN."

DOORS SONG 
Blood is the rose of mysterious union! 
There's blood in the streets &amp; it's up to my knees 
She came 
Blood in the streets of Chicago 
She came 
Blood on the rise and it's following me 
Just about the break of day (etc) 
The river runs red down the legs of the city 
She came 
The women are crying red rivers of weeping

The MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if to 
silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his face. 
Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passes 
out, head hitting the bar.

Jim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh shaft 
of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, bleary 
eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch. 
With him are TOM BAKER, "TOM", the actor from the Warhol 
scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG, 
one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos 
everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are about 
twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptied 
and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of 
bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown paper 
bag.

		MIKE
	Morning. Pour me breakfast Delores...

Delores pouring the bloody mary. As Mike scoffs at Jim passed 
out.

		MIKE
	Whatsa matter with Jimbo? Can't handle 
	it huh
		(studying the beer 
		bottles for leftovers)

		TOM
	Pussy whipped, man...

DOG reaching in, dragging Jim's face up by the hair. Sticks 
Mike's greasy eggs and bacon in front of Jim.

		DOG
	Hey Jim, come on babe, eat this. . . 
	one last place to go. Ray's getting 
	it on.

Jim is suddenly alert -- an instant and surprising 
transformation, without hangover, eager eyed.

		JIM
		(sparkling)
	Alive she cried! Right Dog, another 
	cubic centimeter of chance
		(slaps Dog, notices 
		the eggs, queasy)
	Ugh, I can't eat this stuff, it'll 
	really make me sick. Gimme a Dos 
	Equis will ya Delores? And a Ramos 
	gin fizz with it.

		TOM
	Fuck man did you fade or what, we 
	were on a "death run" up to the 9000 
	building after the gig, you bet me a 
	grand you'd walk the ledge.

		JIM
		(instantly)
	Let's go... Right now!

		TOM
	Then mumbling about "gotta go home, 
	sanctuary," pussy whipped. We were 
	gonna film it! A thousand bucks!
		(to Delores)
	Give him a double.

		JIM
	A triple, Tom, shem and shaun...

		TOM
	...imagine me and Morrison in a fuckin 
	movie together, can you imagine two 
	powerful two-fisted Irish fucking 
	drinking guys in a movie, in a 
	documentary movie!!

		MIKE
	I'll direct the shit out of it, man. 
	Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do 
	it.

		JIM
		(drinking the fizz 
		down)
	...all of us direct it! In black and 
	white. Call it "Zero." A real road 
	movie! Two of these
		(points to drink)
	you feel a lot better.

As he pisses on the floor next to the bar stool.

		DOG
	Whatcha doing! Oh fuck.

		DELORES
	Fuck you Morrison. You're outta here 
	you fuckhead, get out!

		DOG
		(lifting Jim out of 
		there)
	Come on Jimbo, one more place to go. 
	Ray's getting married man, this 
	morning, remember! You're the best 
	man.

		TOM
	Fuck Ray -- fuckin Pollock all he 
	cares about's money. Fuckin sell 
	out. You sold out too man. The last 
	album's shit, and lemme tell ya 
	something, people know it.

		MIKE
		(defending Jim)
	Come on Baker, lighten up.

		JIM
	That's all right. I like it
		(that dopey smile)

		DOG
		(to Jim)
	Come on man, toe the line. Boots to 
	the pavement. Let's walk.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - SAME MORNING

JIM, loose, wanders right into the traffic, waving to anybody, 
trying to hitch a ride. DOG and the OTHERS going after him. 
Jim seen slipping a tablet from his pocket into his mouth.

		JIM
		(to no one in 
		particular)
	I LOVE L.A. -- the best neon. City 
	of Night! City of Light... why are 
	you going to work? You're not slaves, 
	you're free, cars, you're free...

TOM catching up to him.

		TOM
	Awright shaddup Morrison, just cause 
	you don't gotta work.
		(going into his pocket)
	Give me some of your money, asshole, 
	and I'll yell anything you fucking 
	want.

		MIKE
		(coming up)
	What was that speckled motherfucker 
	you just took? Give me some!

		JIM
		(yielding, to Tom)
	You gotta fail to succeed Tom, gotta 
	surrender to the waiting tides.

Moving through traffic. Horns honking, incessant insanity.

EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES - SAME MORNING

RAY and DOROTHY take their vows in front of a HIPPIE PRIEST.

ROBBIE and JOHN and their WIVES-TO-BE, and OTHERS from the 
BAND look on.

PAMELA is all decked out in her best, wedding clothes, red 
satins from Morocco, five-inch clog heels, flowers in her 
hair. Looking around pissed as:

		HIPPIE PRIEST
		(ad lib)
	Awright, the vibrations are right 
	now, I feel peace and love here today, 
	I feel a grooviness coming on, do 
	you Ray Manzarek take your lady 
	love... (etc.) fill the white wings 
	of death, scatter your ashes 
	forever...

JIM slinks up through the trees, alone, quiet, changing faces 
to face them as SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE plays sinuously.

DOORS SONG 
Summer's almost gone 
Where will we be 
When the summer's gone?

		RAY
		(aside)
	Where the fuck you been man?

		JIM
	Man, I been here all the time... 
	over there watching. I'm really happy 
	for you Ray you found life...

He smiles innocently. Ray, a beat, turns away. Pam coming 
over, squeezes his hand, sweetly, no fights today, she's his 
lady.

INT. COUNTRY STORE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY

JIM, in dark glasses, strongly feeling the effects of the 
acid, stares at a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes, unable to 
relate.

Down the aisle PAMELA, in her wedding clothes, is pushing a 
shopping cart, filled with the feast she's preparing. The 
Store is a haven for HIPPIES from Laurel Canyon, barefoot 
RUNAWAYS, BIKERS...

		PAM
	Jim, I need some safflower oil. Do 
	you think you can find me a bottle?

		JIM
	Safflower oil, sure.

		PAM
	And get some Gravy Train for Sage.

		JIM
		(obediently)
	Yes.

		PAM
	I'll meet you up front.

Jim looking, zombie-like for the food. PEOPLE of course stare 
at him, knowing who he is.

									TIMECUT TO:

At the CHECK-OUT COUNTER, the food being tallied up, JIM 
spots his face plastered on the cover of something like the 
"L.A. FREE PRESS" -- "ROCK'S BAD BOYS GO SOFT -- WHAT'S 
HAPPENED TO THE REVOLUTION?"

		PAM
	Jim you got any cash?

Seeking in his pocket -- nothing but a credit card and a 
rumpled old dollar bill... The faces of the Hippies looking 
at him. With one of the magic markers on the counter, he 
draws in his beard on his cover shot.

DOORS SONG 
Morning found us clearly unaware 
Noon burned gold into our hair 
At night we swam the laughing sea 
When summer's gone where will we be

EXT. JIM &amp; PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - DAY

PAM and JIM and the labrador SAGE trudge up a hill carrying 
the groceries to their modest little house tucked into a 
hill of dangling eucaplyptus trees. We sense a community of 
artists, hippies, Volkswagens.

		PAM
	It's only another $95,000 but I could 
	get the best clothes. From India, 
	Morocco Jim, clothes you can't find 
	anywhere, we could get the richest 
	people to come, Miles Davis, Cher, 
	the Stones, it's gonna be the best 
	boutique on La Cienega Jim... why 
	are we walking, how come we don't 
	have a car?

		JIM
	...cause you lost it. It's fun to 
	walk, isn't it.

		PAM
	...that was months ago. We got another 
	car.

		JIM
	Which car?

		PAM
	The red one with the black interior. 
	Remember it was a shift and I didn't 
	like it. What happened to it?

		JIM
	Oh yeah... I wrecked it.

		PAM
	Oh Jim! Damn! Where's the Gravy Train? 
	Whatsamatter? What are you on? You 
	promised you wouldn't drink today.

		JIM
	No Ma I ain't drinking.

		PAM
	You're not gonna drink any more are 
	you Jim.

		JIM
	No Ma I ain't.

		PAM
	And you're gonna change those stinky 
	leathers you been wearing for three 
	weeks.

		JIM
	I don't know 'bout that.

		PAM
	What the hell are you on?

		JIM
	Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's 
	not heavy.
		(whispers)
	Pam, read my mind.

		PAM
	Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I 
	made the duck! People are coming! 
	Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky 
	enough and I... you said you'd wait 
	till after, you're going to peak 
	before me.

		JIM
	Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on, 
	we'll trip and then eat our feast.

		PAM
	Yeah sure.

Putting down the bags at their porch, pausing. He moves to 
her, kisses her, conciliatory and gentle.

		JIM
	Come on baby, y'know it's a good 
	thing for Ray and Dorothy I think 
	women are such noble creatures -- 
	they carry on your name with dignity 
	after you die.
		(spawning like minnows)

		PAM
	What are you saying? You wanna marry 
	me Jim?

		JIM
		(elusively)
	I think women basically have a comic 
	approach to life -- I mean how can 
	they not when they look up in the 
	dark and see a dangling penis, seeking 
	entry. It looks like a face y'know -- 
	little beard "Hi mom"
		(Pam giggling now)
	I wanna get inside you. Look around.
		(humming)
	"Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah, 
	funky chicken do da da "love my girl" --

She's cracking up now. As he takes the acid out, holds it in 
front of her like a sacrament.

		JIM
	Let's go wild child, let's get out 
	there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe 
	and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, 
	rock and roll
		(a poem)
	...all the poetry has wolves in it, 
	but one Pam -- the most beautiful 
	one of all -- dances in a ring of 
	fire and throws off the challenge 
	with a shrug

As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows.

		PAM
		(romantic)
	I like it when you sing to me

		JIM
	'cause I'm the poet and you're my 
	muse

Strains of YOU'RE LOST, LITTLE GIRL drift in, setting a more 
ominous tone.

INT. JIM AND PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY

The FOOD is laid out, the DUCK cooking... but no one is there 
as we move across this tastefully decorated house to PAMELA 
in the living room, rattled, obsessively going through Jim's 
papers. PEOPLE are knocking at the door. Guests looking 
through the windows, tapping. A giant poster of Marilyn Monroe 
frames Pamela.

		PAM
	What am I going to do about these 
	papers! Jim, Jim -- you really need 
	someone to organize this stuff. Your 
	handwriting's just like a little 
	kid.

Jim is somewhere else -- pulling out the DUCK which is totally 
charred black. He laughs.

		PAM
	My God look at this. I wonder if 
	William Blake was ever this 
	disorganized.

RAY and DOROTHY walking in. ROBBIE and JOHN general commotion. 
Dorothy immediately seeing the duck, runs to it...

		DOROTHY
	Oh the duck!

		JIM
		(coming over)
	Get some drinks, man. Over there
		(getting Pam's 
		attention)
	Pam!

		PAM
	I'm gonna be your editor now, 
	seriously I'm going to organize all 
	your stuff. I'm gonna take out all 
	the fuck words.

DOORS SONG 
You're lost little girl 
You're lost little girl 
You're lost, tell me 
Who are you?

PEOPLE are introducing themselves, coming in from all over, 
like in a shoebox. Hippies. Doors people... now TOM BAKER 
with MIKE and DOG... Now an aggressive Chuck Berry type BLACK 
SINGER with John's GIRLFRIEND. Then a TIMOTHY LEARY look-
alike appears. CHATTER blending everywhere as we build to a 
vast confusion at Jim and Pam's party.

		JIM
	Let's go wild child, let's get out 
	there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe 
	and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, 
	rock and roll
		(a poem)
	"Clothed in sunlight Restless in 
	wanting Dying of fever Changed shapes 
	of an empire Vast promissory notes 
	of joy How it has changed you How 
	slowly estranged you Solely arranged 
	you Beg you for mercy"

As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows.

		JIM
		(cupping her chin)
	Pam... Honey, you're trying too hard.

		PAM
	I'm not -- I'm not.

		JIM
		(soft, reassuring)
	Yes you are.

		PAM
	There's some great poetry here Jim, 
	some wonderful ideas.

		JIM
	Yeah but nobody wants to read poetry 
	anymore, nobody cares, it's not like 
	important y'know. Just put it away. 
	Not right now.

		PAM
		(lost)
	But what am I supposed to do? How do 
	I fit in? Who am I supposed to be 
	around all these people?

The FRENCH COUNT coming in now, from the Warhol party in New 
York. They're looking at her, embarrassing as everyone 
overhears.

		COUNT
	Darling Pamela, I brought you a little 
	something.

		JIM
		(ignoring it)
	You're my girl, that's who...

		PAMELA
		(laughs insanely)
	I'm not your girl, don't give me 
	that shit. I know you fuck everything 
	that touches you.

Only in life would ANNE O'RIORDAN walk in at this precise 
moment, a smile on her face. Ray's eyes roll.

		ANNE
	Hi Jim...
		(waiting for the 
		introduction to Pam)

		JIM
		(to Pamela)
	All right so I do. I live my life 
	the way I want. I don't want anyone 
	expecting anything from me -- 
	including you! You don't like it 
	then get the fuck out!
		(to Anne)
	Oh hi Anne. You know Pam? She's a 
	little pissed off right now but...

		RAY
	Okay Jim let's eat that duck.

		DOROTHY
		(calming Pamela)
	Come on Pam, let's put out the 
	plates...

		PAMELA
		(stunned, pushing 
		thru to Anne)
	Anne O'Riordan. Are you Anne 
	O'Riordan?

		ANNE
	You must be Pamela

		PAMELA
		(eyeing her up and 
		down through her 
		tears)
	You actually put your dick in this 
	woman Jim?

		JIM
	Well I... sometimes yeah

		PAMELA
		(condescending to 
		Anne)
	I understand... I really do but don't 
	ever think that Jim's gonna love you 
	or take care of you. You're one of a 
	hundred you know

Anne uncomfortable, Jim getting pissed.

		JIM
	Hey -- don't you know when to stop!

		PAM
	Look who's talking

		ANNE
	I'd like to think Jim can make up 
	his own mind who he loves and who he 
	doesn't.

		PAMELA
	Don't kid yourself sweetheart, Jim's 
	crazy but he's not that crazy. He 
	loves me.

		ROBBIE
	Jesus, it's not gonna be one of these 
	dinners is it Jim? How 'bout some 
	turkey?

		BAKER
	Love it!! Far out.

		DOROTHY
	Yes, let's go into the kitchen. The 
	duck's ready.

John's GIRLFRIEND is trying to introduce the BLACK SINGER to 
Jim.

		GIRLFRIEND
		(anxious)
	Jim, you should meet Chuck Vincent. 
	He came specially to meet you.

		JIM
		(deeply surprised)
	Oh yeah -- Chuck. You're my idol 
	man... since I was 12. The best man...

CHUCK VINCENT is suddenly there in Jim's face, bulging 
eyeballs.

		CHUCK VINCENT
	So you the white boy makin' all that 
	money.

		JIM
	I still can't hold a candle to you.

		CHUCK VINCENT
	Hey everybody Chuck Vincent's here. 
	Yo sho can't boy, I ain't heard much 
	of yor stuff. What I done heard don't 
	show me much.

		ROBBIE
		(insulted)
	So fuck you man...

		JIM
		(laughs)
	Chuck Vincent man! No. He's right... 
	Chuck Vincent's here, everybody, 
	Chuck Vincent.

		CHUCK
	Ain't no honkey ever gonna sing the 
	blues, you ain't been there. Where 
	dat turkey at?

The charred TURKEY is being carved up. A moment of peace, 
then: Pamela walks up to Jim with a bowl of sweet potatoes 
in her arms, an announcement.

		PAM
	I just have one thing to say to you -- 
	YOU'VE RUINED ANOTHER THANKSGIVING 
	JIM MORRISON!!

		JIM
	It's not Thanksgiving honey.

As she throws the sweet potatoes right at him, spraying 
everybody. Jim laughing nuttily, the Count wiping the potatoes 
off. Pam rushing now for the turkey to throw, Jim chasing 
her.

		PAM
		(freaking out now)
	YOU BASTARD! YOU RUINED MY DUCK, YOU 
	KILLED MY DUCK!!! BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD 
	RAZORS RAZORS EVERYWHERE!

Throwing the turkey at Jim, smearing everything, everybody.

		COUNT
	Pamela, bella, please behave hunh... 
	Va fanculo Jimmy, what the hell did 
	you give her

She doesn't want the Count's solace, throws him off.

		PAM
	GET OUT!!!

PATRICIA leaving now, covered with turkey sauce.

		PATRICIA
	See you later.

		JIM
		(to the Count)
	She's working it out, man, it's okay
		(going to console her)
	Pamela, Pamela... come on baby, it's 
	all right, shhh.

HUNGARIAN GYPSY FOLK MUSIC playing madly from the tape deck. 
John fiddling with it, nervously.

		PAM
	BLOOOOOOODDDDDDD! DEEATHHHH! STOP 
	THE BLEEDING JESUS. I'M DYING HELP 
	MEEEEEE!

		JIM
	PUSH! PUSH! IT'S A BOY!

They struggle, she goes for the carving knife, Dorothy and 
Ray trying to restrain her. OTHER GUESTS keep talking as if 
things are quite normal. Pam breaks through Dorothy -- coming 
after Jim

		PAM
	RAAAAZOOOORS!!! RAAAAZZZZZORS AND 
	DUCKKKS! THIS SHAMAN SHIT IS BULLSHIT! 
	FUCK YOU AND YOUR DARK RIDE!!

He grabs her wrist just in time, equally insane now -- a 
comic glow in his face. Jekyll and Hyde.

		JIM
	Oh murder? MURDER??? YOU WANNA DO 
	SOME MURDER

		RAY
	JIM! COME ON. GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!

		TOM, DOG &amp; MIKE
		(jumping in)
	MURDER!!! YEAH!... Where's my camera!

A ball of people wrestling across the kitchen floor, upsetting 
the table and the remainder of the dishes, a carving knife 
at stake in the air... Jim finally wrestling the knife away 
and holding it over Pam.

		JIM
	YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT MURDER IS. YOU 
	WANNA FEEL DEATH... HERE!
		(forces the knife 
		back into her hand)
	MURDER ME! FEEL WHAT IT'S LIKE! GO 
	AHEAD. GIMME SOME DEATH!!!
		(kneels at her feet)

She explodes inward, a bloodcurdling SHRIEK. The knife 
clattering from her hand.

		PAM
	YOU YOU YOU!!!! YOU KILLED MY DUCK! 
	YOU KILLED MY DUCK!!

Jim laughing insanely. Jumping up and down on the duck. RAY 
grabbing him, angry.

		JIM
	I'M STILL KILLING YOUR DUCK!!! FUCK!!! 
	MURDER DEATH!!! THE DUCK IS DEAD.

		RAY
	JIM!! WILL YOU STOP THIS SHIT WILL 
	YOU STOP!! WILL YOU GET SANE!!

		JIM
		(explodes out of his 
		grasp)
	DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!! EVER!! 
	EVER!!

A silence. Robbie... John... their women... they start 
exiting.

		TOM &amp; MIKE
		(to RAY)
	Yeah FUCK OFF MAN!

Ray about to lose his temper with Tom, checks it.

		CHUCK VINCENT
		(to John's girlfriend)
	This party's gettin' low rent. Let's 
	go babe.

Exiting with the other Doors... Dog picking the duck up from 
the floor.

		DOG
	Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.

Pamela is sobbing, in a quiet bewildered voice, repeating to 
herself.

		PAM
	What the hell's happened to us Jim? 
	What the hell is happening to us. 
	There's some great poetry...

On Jim... saddened.

DOORS SONG 
You're lost little girl (2) 
You're lost, tell me 
Who are you?

INT. TUNNEL - OUTDOOR THEATRE - NIGHT

The backbeat of NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH as a DOCUMENTARY FILM 
CREW, moves past us directed by MIKE and DOG and TOM shoot 
past us, sun guns, nagras ("Rolling! Speed!") then...

A mad rush of HANDS and SCREAMS as SHAPES whip by under 
swinging light-bulbs -- big BLACK BODYGUARDS, six or seven 
of them, bulling their way thru the grasping faces, as 
MORRISON appears... camera swinging wildly with him to reveal:

EXT. ARENA - (ANY CITY) - NIGHT

THOUSANDS OF FANS roaring "DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!"

		VOICE
		(loudspeaker)
	Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles 
	California -- The DOORS!

		SIDDONS
		(in crush)
	Jim! Your Mom's here with your 
	brother. What do you want me to do 
	with 'em?

		JIM
		(shakes his head)
	HIDE ME!!!

										HARD CUT TO:

Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. 
As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and 
does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style, 
one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. 
The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting 
giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and 
short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards 
in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim 
to communicate with his audience.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	There's been a slaughter here 
	Don't stop to speak or look around 
	Your gloves and fan are on the ground 
	We're getting out of town we're going 
	on the run 
	And you're the one I want to come 
	Not to touch the earth 
	Not to see the sun 
	Nothing left to do 
	But run, run, run 
	Let's run, let's run...

SIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie.

		SIDDONS
	Vice Squad says one more "fuck or 
	shit" they're gonna close us down 
	man.

		MIKE
	Stick my dick in their ear!

Jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening 
for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state, 
weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE 
of hallucinatory insanity.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	House upon the hill 
	Moon is lying still...

EXT. JIM &amp; PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

A POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights 
are on. Sage at the door sniffing.

INT. JIM &amp; PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Shadows of the trees witnessing the 
	wild breeze 
	Come on baby run with me 
	Run with me, let's run...

JIM'S POV entering the bedroom -- PAMELA naked in bed with 
the COUNT, is snorting heroin. Shadows of the trees and leaves 
blowing against the walls. Their voices, dim, distant.

		JIM
		(ironic)
	Oh hi... I didn't realize you were 
	entertaining.

		PAM
		(stoned)
	Hi.

She sits up on the bed, wobbly. The COUNT, more sophisticated 
in these things, lights a cigarette from the bedside table, 
revealing heroin paraphernalia.

		COUNT
	Scusi Jimmy, I hope you're cool about 
	this...

		JIM
		(very cool)
	Don't forget your smack on the way 
	out.

EXT. ARENA - CONCERT

Jim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops.

		JIM
		(yelling)
	The mansion is warm at the top of 
	the hill 
	Rich are the rooms and the comforts 
	there 
	Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs 
	You won't know a thing till you get 
	inside

							BACK TO:

INT. JIM &amp; PAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The COUNT is gone. JIM, icy cold, grabs PAM by the wrist.

		JIM
	I told you about that shit. Or are 
	we talking about death choices here?

		PAM
	I'm just doing my thing, just like 
	you said, it's my thing, why can't I 
	have a thing. Ow! You're hurting me!

		JIM
		(rising anger)
	Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT? 
	Let me introduce you to my good friend 
	hurt.

He is on her, throws her from the bed. She runs and hides in 
the closet, slamming the door behind her.

		PAM
		(screaming)
	NO FUCK YOU! THIS IS MY...

		JIM
		(crazed)
	Ah sanctuary!... a soft place to 
	hide.

		PAM
		(inside)
	...from you, you pig!

As he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet 
door and the floor.

		JIM
	I'll give you a place to hide forever!

We INTERCUT with PAM inside the closet yelling for mercy 
inside.

		PAM
	JIM!

He puts a candle to the drenched door/floor.

		JIM
	This is the best part of the trip, 
	honey...

Inside, PAM feels the first flames licking up, smoke wafting 
in.

JIM leaves the house.

Pam kicking wildly at the doors, trying to smash her way out 
as the FIRE crescendoes. She finally shatters the frail 
molding and bursts out.

EXT. JIM &amp; PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

PAM runs out into Laurel Canyon like a terrified doe running 
from a forest fire. SONG beat NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH 
continues.

EXT. STREET - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Jim and Mike driving drunk, fucking TWO BLACK CHICKS. Mike 
in the back seat. Jim drives the car up onto the grass of a 
Police Station and plows right into it.

EXT. BOULEVARD - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Knowing who's inside, sufficient be it to see the blue Shelby 
Mustang plow into a telephone pole on Santa Monica Blvd.

		JIM &amp; THE DOORS
	Dead President's corpse in the 
	driver's car 
	The engine runs on glue and tar 
	C'mon along, we're not going very 
	far 
	To the East to meet the Czar...

INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A HIGH PRIESTESS, assisted by a HIGH PRIEST, conducts a Wicca 
wedding amidst a setting of candles, mixing a few drops of 
JIM and ANNE's blood into a consecrated cup of wine, from 
which they drink. They all wear long black robes, the only 
light from the candles, standing inside a circle in front of 
a table with altar, incense, chalice.

		HIGH PRIESTESS
		(dimly heard)
	...we worship the ancient forces of 
	Nature, the Triple Goddess, the Great 
	Mother and the Lord, the Horned One... 
	when the vow is taken

INT. LIMO - DAY

MOTORCYCLE ESCORTS COPS zoom past the limo windows on the LA 
STREETS.

INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - RESUME NIGHT

The PRIESTESS presses the two cut wrists together, binding 
them with a red cord.

		HIGH PRIESTESS
	...it is a blending of souls on a 
	karmi and cosmic plane that affects 
	your future incarnations on this 
	planet. Death does not part -- only 
	lack of love -- and the vow is forever 
	in the Goddess' sight.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
		(building faster and 
		faster)
	Run with me, run with me 
	Run with me, let's run 
	Some outlaws live by the side of a 
	lake 
	The minister's daughter's in love 
	with a snake

Jim faints.

EXT. DOORS OUTDOOR CONCERT - NIGHT

JIM, mind totally gone into his trance, spreading his arms 
like wings, hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman 
around his microphone, whirling, yelling out great rewards 
for the tribe. Plentiful antelope, healthy corn.

The kids are going wild -- writhing like maenads in his 
intoxicating embrace. Embers from an enormous BONFIRE drift 
past the stadium lights into the night. But the KIDS, 
increasingly frustrated by a barrage of COPS, cannot see 
their leader and now push against the cops with the very 
result the authorities seek to repress.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Who lives in a well by the side of 
	the road 
	Wake up girl! We're almost home 
	We shall see the gates by morning 
	We shall be inside by evening 
	Sun, sun, sun 
	Burn, burn, burn 
	Moon, moon, moon!

RAY, gone into his own trance, happening to look up from his 
keyboard. His eyes widen.

His POV -- an INDIAN SHAMAN hovers over the microphone. 
Cloaked in hides, his face obscured by a horned headdress 
with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders, 
rattles in each fist, the BONFIRE glowing...

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	I will GET YOU 
	Soon -- soooooooon... SOOOOOOONNNN...

The COPS can't hold. TEENAGE SHOCK TROOPS hitting the stage, 
clambering up. The stage becoming a riot. Cops wading in 
with sticks. ROADIES and BODYGUARDS yanking the MUSICIANS 
from their places...

		JIM
		(indifferent, to 
		himself)
	I am the Lizard King I can do anything

As DOG hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug, smiling stoned, 
immaculate.

INT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL - DAY

Start slow CLOSE UP on JIM, he's crying, his head on a pillow, 
silent, haunted... pull out to see the room, no explanations. 
A TV GAME SHOW is on, JUDY, 17, and her FRIEND, 16, watching 
naked, skinny..., piles of murder magazines and books, 
clothes, and personal items trashed around the thread bare 
room he calls home. She looks over at him.

		JUDY
	Man wow -- watsa matter Jim? It was 
	beautiful... wasn't it? Kim? Wasn't 
	it great?

		KIM
		(2nd girl, studying 
		murder magazine)
	It was all right

Jim continues to cry.

		JIM
		(gently)
	Hey it's no big deal. I like to cry 
	when I come. It's close to death... 
	maybe you'd better go home now before 
	your mama gets home.

		JUDY
	She is home Jim
		(whispers to Kim who 
		goes into bathroom, 
		giggling)

		JIM
	What?

		JUDY
	It's a secret.

		JIM
		(innocently)
	You know you've always been good to 
	me in bed Judy. And it was nice of 
	you to bring your friend. I want to 
	keep seeing both of you but it can't 
	be all the time y'know. It would be 
	a night every few weeks or so. That's 
	just the way I am, I'm not dependable. 
	I can't be a boyfriend. Would you do 
	that? I mean could you handle it? 
	That way? I don't want you to get 
	hurt.

		JUDY
		(putting on a tacky 
		dress)
	I already been hurt enuf' by you 
	Jim, I don't have much to lose do I?

		JIM
	...do you love me?

		JUDY
	...yes

		JIM
	...Well, just think about it awhile. 
	Call me when you get your new 
	number...
		(Girl 2 comes back 
		in, dressed)
	Hey that's a really nice outfit you're 
	wearing, you really have good taste 
	in clothes. How long have you two 
	been friends?

He's so concerned, so solicitous that both girls crack up 
laughing.

		JIM
		(grins)
	What?

A knock at the door.

		JIM
	Come back later!
		(another knock)
	Who is it!

		VOICE
		(slurred)
	It's a secret.

		JIM
		(recognizes it)
	Whyn't you come back later. I don't 
	have any clothes on.

EXT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY

PAM's mascara is running from her eyes, begging to get in. 
The BLACK MAID cleaning the adjacent room overheard, 
unsurprised.

		PAM
	Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please. 
	I gotta talk.

		JIM
	Now Pam sweetheart, I'm busy.

Pamela listening at the door. She's on the second story of a 
cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of 
La Cienega.

		PAM
	Jim, I know there's someone in there, 
	I can't believe you're doing this 
	again. You're disgusting.

								INTERCUTS TO:

INT. MOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

		JIM
	Well you see Pam there's this crazy 
	girl in here, she's just lying on 
	the bed with her legs open and I 
	don't know what to do.

		PAM
	FUCK YOU!!! I want to see her.

		JIM
		(off)
	It's your cousin Lizzie, you don't 
	want to see her. Go home.

		PAM
	We're all sisters, let me see her. 
	Jim,... I got this wonderful leg of 
	lamb in the oven for supper... and 
	the house is immaculate. Sage is 
	waiting. He wants you to play with 
	him... are you coming...

		JIM
	Almost.

		PAM
	Jim goddamit answer me!!
		(no answer, she yells)
	JIM! I FUCKED HIM TO HURT YOU! HE 
	DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME!!

PEOPLE in the parking lot looking up. A silence is her only 
response. She waits, turns away from the closed door as TOUCH 
ME BABE cuts in:

DOORS SONG 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon c'mon now 
Touch me babe 
Can't you see that I am not afraid

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - THAT NIGHT

In the VOCAL BOOTH, JIM is chugging on a brown paper bag 
with whiskey in it, crooning with heart but the voice is 
warped, weak.

		JIM
	What was that promise you made 
	Why don't you tell me what she said 
	What was that promise that she made 
	I'm gonna love you 
	Till the heaven stops the rain 
	I'm gonna love you 
	Till the stars fall from the sky 
	For you and I...

VARIOUS PEOPLE are hanging around the studio listening -- a 
couple of HIPPIE CHICKS, A BURN VICTIM w/ bandages, a CHARLES 
MANSON TYPE, a Siberian HUSKY, the TIM LEARY type. Paper 
bags, burgers, bottles, California rose, apple juice, hard-
boiled eggs.

In the ENGINEERING BOOTH. ROTHCHILD, the producer, is 
displeased.

		PAUL
		(to Botnick the 
		engineer)
	...fuckin' neanderthal primadonna is 
	too drunk to see.
		(cuts the music, to 
		Jim)
	Cut it... that was beautiful 
	sweetheat, we had a technical problem, 
	we'll take it again from the top 
	babe whenever you're ready.

On the floor, the DOORS are depressed. DENSMORE looking at 
MORRISON, aimlessly, nervously. KRIEGER looking tired and 
beaten, takes a discreet hit on a joint. Ray scans an art 
book, patient.

		DENSMORE
	What's his fucking problem?

		JIM
		(equally false)
	Paul babe.

		PAUL
	Right here baby.

		JIM
	Why don't you suck a fart out of my 
	asshole you slave driving facist 
	motherfucker!

As he stalks out of the booth. Raging, near-incomprehensible.

A small portable TV set is playing the "Dean Martin Show" 
low on one end of the recording console. Around the room the 
detritus of the time -- Mailer's "Armies of the Night", The 
Stone's "Beggar's Banquet", Janis' "Cheap Thrills", Traffic, 
The Band.

		PAUL
		(exasperated)
	I hear the booze, I hear the smokes 
	Jim, I don't hear the voice and babe 
	I didn't hear the song!

		JIM
	So what are we going to tonight Paul! 
	67 takes! It's stale!

		RAY
		(coming in with JOHN)
	Alright, let's try something else.

		JIM
	I wanna sing blues. This stuffs 
	getting too self-conscious.

		ROBBIE
		(offended)
	Cause it's my song man?

		JIM
		(simultaneous, 
		incomprehensible)
	Let's sing "Rock is Dead"! You're 
	all a buncha slaves... "Oh come all 
	ye faithful."

		PAUL
		(hot)
	Shut up Jim! I don't understand! I 
	don't. What are ya doing! I love you 
	like a brother, I do, but why are 
	you fucking this up. It's a perfect 
	radio song for chrissake! No one 
	wants to hear the blues anymore! 
	Think like a singer, you're the only 
	baritone crooner we got left... 
	Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you're as 
	good as they are, but WHY ARE YOU 
	FUCKING THIS UP! WHY!

Pause. Jim's face darkening. Something he sees on the 
television. He stops, frozen, sickly. Several BIMBETTES are 
dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of LIGHT MY 
FIRE pop out.

		JIM
	Catchy, you sold it to a commercial?

Ray, Siddons, Robbie, John, shuffling for a moment.

		JIM
	For that? How much did you get for 
	it?

		RAY
	Now, Jim...

		JIM
	HOW MUCH?

		SIDDONS
	It was $50,000. You weren't talking 
	to us that week and we figgered you...

		JIM
	You figured? What the fuck is this 
	Ray?

		RAY
	It's not like a big deal Jim, the 
	song's already been commercialized, 
	the money was great. Robbie wrote 
	the lyrics and he didn't mind, neither 
	did I, neither did John... we gotta 
	get to TV.

		JIM
	What?... are you saying? Are we the 
	Doors? One for all and all for one? 
	Do you know what you're saying to 
	those millions of kids! "Just kidding, 
	not real". That's what you're saying.

		JOHN
	Oh come on man, you think just cause 
	you're the lead man in the band you 
	can run the whole show.

		JIM
		(building intensity)
	You think I was kidding Ray?
		(turning to John)
	Hey John, those are interesting shoes, 
	you like those shoes?

PAMELA, looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk 
into the studio.

		JOHN
		(aggressive)
	Yeah I do.

		JIM
	Good. Then do you want 50 of those 
	shoes?

		JOHN
	No.

		JIM
	Then what do you need more money 
	for?

Pause. Turning to Ray.

		JIM
	I'm dying Ray. I wasn't kidding. 
	Maybe you were. But I'll tell you 
	something, it's not about these 
	desires you have man, or money, or 
	these records, it's about breaking 
	through wasn't it? You just lost 
	something man.
		(to all)
	We all lost something boys. We lost 
	something.

		RAY
	I don't think so Jim. There's a bigger 
	picture here.

		JIM
	There sure is. In your fucking face!

A small smile flickers Jim's face as he picks up the small 
TV and like a quarterback, hurls it, spinning end over end 
from his corner of the Control Room towards Ray and Rothchild 
and the Doors. They dive for the floor as it smashes to bits 
into the wall behind the tape machines.

		JIM
		(quietly)
	Just kidding...
		(turning to Pam)
	Hi Pam. Just watchin' some TV.

He seems pleased to distract his anger into her. She doesn't 
seem to notice anything unusual going on. The Doors silent, 
feeling Jim's rage.

		PAM
		(pathetic)
	I wanted you to find us Jim. It meant 
	nothing.

		JIM
	I know. I know.

		PAM
	You don't have to torture me Jim. 
	Let me make it up to you, please...

The others all look away embarrassed. This is certainly a 
moment the ordinary partner might turn away from Pamela, her 
tears running, but her pathacy, her inability to deal with 
pain is precisely what moves Jim the most -- a side of himself 
in her -- an ultimate weakness she has, he shares. As he 
goes to her, puts his arms gently around her.

		JIM
	It's alright honey, it's gonna be 
	alright. You're my girl and that's 
	the way it's always gonna stay.

		PAM
		(snuggles him, zoned)
	Really...?

		JIM
		(ironic, to the others)
	So, let's keep that money machine 
	rolling. Come on guys...

Rothchild looking to Botnick and to Ray. But the real look, 
the unforgiving one, is from Jim to Ray who feels it. 
Rothchild douses the lights in the studio.

		PAUL
	Right on Jimbo.

										TIME CUT TO:

Overdubb of DOORS SONG SOFT PARADE - Jim's VOICE booming 
thru the studio.

		JIM
		(reciting)
	When I was back there in seminary 
	school 
	There was a person there 
	Who put forth the proposition 
	That you can petition the Lord with 
	prayer 
	Petition the Lord with prayer 
	Petition the Lord with prayer
	PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER

ROTHCHILD looking from his booth across at Jim. His POV -- 
only JIM is visible.

		PAUL
	Where the hell did she go?

In the control booth RAY and ROBBIE share a look. The lights 
have been dimmed in Jim's booth, and he's weaving back and 
forth a bottle of Ripple in his hand as they kick in with 
the music. Camera closing now on Jim in the tender section, 
on the money.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Can you give me sanctuary 
	I must find a place to hide 
	A place for me to hide...

In the darkened booth, PAM is on her knees his pants worked 
down around his ankles, caressing him, sucking him off.

		PAM
		(sotto voice)
	...sing to me, Jim, sing to me.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Can you find me soft asylum 
	I can't make it any more 
	The man is at the door

The DOORS sense it. ROTHCHILD knows it, hushed. Magic's 
suddenly in the air once more as we jump stanzas to:

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Catacombs, nursury bones 
	Winter women 
	Streets and shoes, avenues 
	Leather riders selling shoes
		(The monk bought lunch)
	Successful hills are here to stay 
	Everything must be this way 
	Gentle street where people play 
	Welcome to the soft parade

But Jim's voice has now gone off key, floating carefree, 
drifting -- drifting away.

ROTHCHILD chuckles, philosophically.

The Doors in control booth start leaving. Robbie goes back 
out to get his personal items.

But the OVERDUB still plays over the booth as Jim doesn't 
realize. We take liberties cutting around on the song.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	All our lives we sweat and save 
	Building for a shallow grave
		(then)
	The soft parade has now begun 
	Listen to the engines hum 
	People out to have some fun 
	A cobra on my left 
	Leopard on my right

The Doors and ROTHCHILD all exiting, leaving BOTNICK the 
engineer to clean up some technical things... and of course 
the two occupants of the darkened booth.

		JIM SONG
		(fiercely)
	Calling on the dogs (5) 
	When all else fails 
	You can whip the horses' eyes 
	And make them sleep 
	And cry.

The music stops. Silence.

Inside the booth, two shadows breathe deep, huddled on the 
floor in each other's arms. A whisper out of the dark.

		PAM
	I love you.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LAST SESSION (1970) - NIGHT

JIM his head cocked, lost in the memory.

		JIM
		(reciting)
	Why does my mind circle around you? 
	Why do planets wonder what it would 
	be like to be you? 
	All your soft wild promises were 
	words, birds, 
	Endlessly in flight 
	Being drunk is the best disguise 
	As the body is ravaged 
	The spirit grows stronger

Pause. He coughs horribly, the phlegm sucking out his chest 
with a horrid, asthmatic sound which he douses with another 
cigarette and another shot of whiskey. The Bushmills now two 
thirds empty. He looks over at the MYSTERY WOMAN now beside 
him at the microphone. MIKE and the SECRETARY watch.

The bored ENGINEER across the darkened midnight room yawns.

		ENGINEER
	Let's send out for some pizza Jim.

		JIM
	Nah, how 'bout some tacos when we're 
	through?
		(downs another shot, 
		continues)
	The world on fire 
	Taxi from Africa 
	The grand hotel he was drunk a big 
	party last night back, going back in 
	all directions sleeping these insane 
	hours I'll never wake up in a good 
	mood again 
	I'm sick of these stinky boots 
	Do you know we are being led to 
	slaughters by placid admirals? 
	And that fat slow generals are getting 
	obscene on young blood? 
	Do you know we are ruled by TV?
		(pause)

									SLOW DISSOLVE BEGINS:

		JIM
	Oh great Creator of Being 
	Grant us one more hour to perform 
	our art and perfect our lives 
	The moths and atheists are doubly 
	divine in dying 
	We live, we die, and death not ends 
	it 
	Journey we more into the nightmare 
	We're reaching for death on the end 
	of a candle 
	We're trying for something that's 
	already found us...

									DISSOLVING TO:

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1969)

Crammed into every available space of an old SEAPLANE HANGAR 
with no seats -- standing room only -- a MASS of KIDS swelter 
in the heat, grumbling, fanning themselves with programs as 
a warm-up BAND plays.

In the wings of the stage, a RADIO DJ/CRITIC is recording on 
tape. It's the same kid we saw long ago at the Whiskey 
backstage, pronouncing the arrival of the Doors on the scene. 
Now he's got a beard, glasses, a more cynical face.

		RADIO DJ/CRITIC
		(into microphone)
	A hot night in Miami January '69 -- 
	every space in the auditorium is 
	consumed... unfortunately the Doors 
	have long since sold out. They've 
	become an act. Morrison "falls" off 
	the stage at least every other 
	performance. "The Soft Parade" album 
	only confirms the plasticity of their 
	approach. Songs like "Touch Me" and 
	"Follow Me Down" are not the Doors 
	we once knew. So the question is: 
	Why am I here? Are funerals 
	entertainment?

DENSMORE looks on from the stage wings, withdraws -- to RAY 
nearby.

		DENSMORE
	He ain't gonna show! I know it man. 
	We should fuckin' go on without him.

		RAY
	Bill's with him. They're an hour 
	away, he'll get him here.

INT. NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT BAR - SAME NIGHT

SIDDONS, the manager tugs on MORRISON who's getting soused 
with DOG, TOM, MIKE, and ROTHCHILD the producer. The P.A. 
SYSTEM announcing the departure of the Miami flight!

		SIDDONS
	Goddamit Jim! We missed one already, 
	we gotta get this one man!

Jim slams has shot glass on the bar. He's got a beard for 
the first time, looking like a tribal elder.

		JIM
	More!

		MIKE
	Four more all around and up and down!

As the WAITRESS takes the order

		SIDDONS
		(urgent)
	NO! CUT EM OFF! CUT EM OFF!

		JIM
	Don't be so melodramatic Bill, it's 
	not fun anymore.

		DOG
	I can't fly sober.

		SIDDONS
	Jim, you don't show for this one, 
	we're dead, the whole group -- no 
	more bookings.

		JIM
	I care.

		PAUL
	Come on Jim, we'll get fuckin' laid 
	in Miami.

		SIDDONS
	We need the work Jim! They're making 
	us post a $10,000 bond just to show 
	up -- we're the only group in rock-n-
	roll with a fuck clause!
		(aside to Dog)
	Get him on the fuckin' plane. That's 
	what I pay you for.

		DOG
		(to Bill)
	You're an awful little guy to be 
	talking like that.

		JIM
		(muttering)
	Chump change, we're working for chump 
	change.

		SIDDONS
	Look at you, you're a pathetic fuckin' 
	slob and so are all your friends!

		JIM
	I got an idea Bill, you're fired.

										INTERCUT TO:

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT

The warm-up BAND is applauded and booed. The CROWD resembles 
a pit of snakes, wriggling on top of each other. Impatient 
CATCALLS.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

		JOHN
	Listen to 'em! They're not coming 
	for the music anymore. They're coming 
	to see a fuckin' freak show!

		RAY
	You think it's easy for him. He moves 
	left he's got vice squad, on the 
	right narcs -- and the audience just 
	waiting for him to get busted.

		JOHN
	He wanted it! Not us. I just don't 
	fuckin' get the point anymore. I 
	never did I guess. Y'ask me he's 
	just become a drunken fuckin' asshole 
	that's what. And he's gonna take us 
	down with him.

		RAY
	Compassion was never your forte man.

		JOHN
	Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher, 
	you never felt a fuckin thing in 
	your life. I loved that man. I loved 
	what he was.

Robbie strums his guitar, breaks the tension in the room. A 
lick of "Five to One".

		ROBBIE
	It ain't the old Jim that's for sure. 
	I think he's living for everybody 
	else man and somewhere along the way 
	he's lost his own self.

		RAY
		(almost to himself)
	The wine man, the ancient wine. The 
	ancient wine.

		ROBBIE
	What?

		RAY
	Something he once told us. About 
	Dionysos. When the madness took 
	over...

										INTERCUT TO:

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. AIRPLANE - THAT NIGHT

The STEWARDESS, uptight, tries a smile at JIM, TOM, MIKE all 
belted in one row.

		STEWARDESS
	My name is Rita Hager and if...

		JIM
	If your name is Rita, then yor ol 
	man must be ol man Rita!!
		(guffaws)

		TOM, MIKE &amp; DOG
		(chorusing)
	That ol man Riva, he just keep rolling 
	along!

		STEWARDESS
	Excuse me sir, my father is not my 
	old man.

A BABY, with her MOTHER, stares at Jim fascinated. He lifts 
his dark glasses, winks back at her.

									TIMECUT TO:

The STEWARDESS slips the oxygen mask over her face.

		STEWARDESS
	In the event of a decrease of 
	pressure, pull the oxygen mask to 
	your...

		TOM
	Ma ol lady had one of those but she 
	calls it a diaphragm when I'm eating 
	her out!

		DOG
	Nah, it's a douche bag on a dixie 
	cup.

		STEWARDESS
	I'm sorry sir, but you're embarrassing 
	me.

		MIKE
	Great tits.

		SIDDONS
	Come on guys, cool it!

Other PASSENGERS looking over.

										TIME CUT TO:

In flight. Dog squeezes from the lavatory and drops a small 
bar of soap in Jim's drink. They laugh, push, yell. Jim is 
smoking a cigar.

		JIM
		(teasing to Rothchild 
		in the row behind 
		him)
	C'mon Paul, you can get us some heroin 
	man.

		PAUL
		(suddenly serious)
	No I can't and I won't.

		JIM
	Why not?

		PAUL
	Cause I don't want to participate in 
	anything that would accomplish your 
	goal?

		JIM
		(wry)
	Oh and what is my goal Paul? Death?

		PAUL
	"Death old friend".

		JIM
		(laughing)
	Wrong. I just want the pure beauty 
	of absolute zero and sing the blues 
	man -- do nuthin, go nowhere, just 
	be.

		TOM
	With that waistline Jimbo you got no 
	choice.

		JIM
		(laughs, goodnatured)
	What's wrong with being a large 
	mammal, a big beast like a tank. I 
	feel great!

		DOG
	Yeah. What's wrong with being fat.

		TOM
	You mean "Crawling King Flab"? Rock 
	is cock babe and your rock is dyin'.

		JIM
	Rock is death! There is no longer 
	belief. Hey, I'll write poetry and 
	direct movies.

		TOM
	And what are you offering? Sex? You 
	can't get it up. Salvation? You can't 
	even save yourself. Come on Jim, 
	you're not gonna be remembered.

		JIM
	Miss?...

		STEWARDESS
	What do you need?

		JIM
	Some love.

		MIKE
	They'll still be talking about Jim 
	when you're a walk on Baker. I'll 
	make you a deal. When you do 
	something, I'll criticize it.

		TOM
	I think you both should take your 
	heads out of the toilet bowl. After 
	"Soft Parade" You need an album 
	sweetheart.

		MIKE
	You should take it outta your ass.

		JIM
	The first two novels come along they 
	love you, next few they slam but if 
	you stay around long enough, one day 
	they say, "hey he's part of the 
	national psyche".

		STEWARDESS
	What are you drinking?

		MIKE
	Screwdrives-her.
		(lifts her skirt)

		STEWARDESS
		(to Siddons)
	I'm going to have to call the captain 
	if you can't control these people. I 
	guarantee that.

		TOM
		(a cruel sarcasm Jim 
		seems to enjoy)
	...if you live long enough, don't 
	kid yourself Jimbo -- you're all 
	alone out there, Jimbo, cept for me, 
	cause you're too wacked out man, 
	they're scared, you're too fuckin 
	crazy.

		JIM
		(feigning innocence)
	I wasn't mad, Tom. I was only 
	interested in freedom.

		TOM
		(the devil)
	Bullshit! You're bored, you're not 
	free. You tested all the limits, 
	fame, fucking, money, -- whatcha 
	gonna do now Jimbo! When the music's 
	over, when you're too fat and ugly 
	to get on a stage, whatcha gonna do 
	for act three -- puke on Heaven's 
	door?

		JIM
	Listen you two bit fuckin actor, you 
	underestimate the audience. You think 
	they all want a better job, a house, 
	two cars, money, that's what you 
	think but you know what they really 
	want, Tom, in their lives, what they 
	really want --

		TOM
	Tell me.

		JIM
		(a whisper)
	...something sacred, that's what 
	they want, something sacred.

Tom spews the contents of his mouth all over Jim in response. 
Jim throws his sandwich back at Tom... then another drink 
goes...

		JIM
	Fuck you ignorant devil's asshole 
	slave!

		TOM
	No you. Something sacred. My cock is 
	sacred. Suck on that!

		JIM
	I don't eat shrimp.

A full fledged food fight in progress. Dog, Tom, Jim, Mike 
pushing and shoving. A drink spills over an innocent 
PASSENGER.

		DOG
	Incoming!

The STEWARDESS coming up with the CAPTAIN.

		CAPTAIN
	ALL RIGHT!! If you young men don't 
	change your attitude right now, when 
	we get to Miami you're going to be 
	arrested.

		JIM
	Yes, sir.
		(reflexively)

		TOM
		(saluting)
	YESSIR -- you asshole.

EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - SAME NIGHT

PLANE taxiing up. TWO POLICE CARS, red lights revolving, are 
waiting.

INT. PLANE - SAME NIGHT

PILOT escorting FOUR FBI AGENTS aboard.

		CAPTAIN
	As captain of this ship I'm placing 
	all four of you under arrest. The 
	FBI will...

		MIKE
	For what! What'd we do!

		TOM
	Read me my rights, motherfuckers... 
	motherfuckin bulls!

JIM stunned in his drunkenness. SIDDONS and ROTHCHILD 
protesting AD LIBS.

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT

The CROWD is heckling a long-haired HIPPIE in a leather hat 
who cradles a live, snow-white LAMB telling him to "GET OFF", 
screaming AD LIB for the "DOORS, DOORS, DOORS!! JIM JIM JIM!!"

		HIPPIE
	Look at this thing! Look at this 
	beautiful little living thing!! How 
	can you eat it!! How can you eat its 
	flesh???

CATCALLS. Angry fists pound the edge of the proscenium. Bodies 
push and pack against each other. If Hieronymus Bosch had 
painted a rock concert, this would be it.

		HIPPIE
	LOVE ANIMALS, DON'T EAT THEM!!!! 
	(Boos!!)

INT. BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT

Excitement. EVERYBODY moving fast...

...as JIM, dark sunglasses and beard, surrounded by TWO FBI 
AGENTS and his BODYGUARDS move toward the stage, two hours 
late. SIDDONS with him arguing AD LIB with RAY and the 
PROMOTER, a southern sleazeball with long muttonchops and 
velvet shirt and beads. A mess -- the CROWD chanting DOORS! 
DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!

		SIDDONS
		(screaming at promoter)
	What the FUCK happened to the SEATS!!
		(grabs him)
	What's the FUCKING IDEA man! THERE'S 
	NO SEATS!

		PROMOTER
	I took 'em out! What's wrong with 
	that! We stuffed an extra five thou 
	in there.
		(pissed at Jim)
	Where the fuck you been!

		SIDDONS
	That wasn't THE FUCKING IDEA MAN!! 
	We're gonna sue you!... We're pulling 
	the plug.

		PROMOTER
	So sue me! You're playing or you 
	ain't leaving here with your equipment 
	sonny!

		SIDDONS
		(to Ray)
	We're not playing.

Meanwhile, JOHN arguing with RAY and JIM who sways, drunk. 
The FBI agents get lost in the background.

		JOHN
	I'm not going out there man!

		RAY
	JOHN, C'MON!!

		JOHN
	Look at him! I'm not going out there 
	'till I get some sorta guarantee 
	he's gonna stay in line. I've had it 
	with this shit.

		JIM
	Whatsa matter, scared Johnny boy?

		JOHN
		(going physically for 
		Jim)
	YOU'RE A FUCKIN ASSHOLE MAN!!

		RAY
	JOHN!! STOP IT!! COME ON!!

Jim laughing, throws his arm around ROBBIE for support, ROBBIE 
patient with him. John yelling as they approach the curtains 
and the lights and the first monster realization of the 
THOUSAND MOUTHS waiting in the pit of hell.

		JOHN
	You're pushing death Morrison. 
	Everybody thinks we're drug addicts 
	cause of you Morrison.

		JIM
	We the Beatles yet?

		JOHN
		(held by Ray)
	We took drugs to EXPAND MINDS ASSHOLE, 
	not ESCAPE. I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE 
	WITH YOU.

		JIM
	Hey John y'ever eaten human flesh? 
	When we get to New York, I know this 
	chick...

		RAY
		(taking John aside)
	Come on man.

		JOHN
	I'm not going out there!

		RAY
	We'll talk tomorrow, we'll settle 
	it. Just do it tonight man and...

As JIM brings up a tiny vial with a lubricating head on it, 
holds it to Robbie's lips playfully. They're in the shadows.

		JIM
	...just a touch Robbie, it's the 
	funkiest stuff, you'll play like an 
	orgasm tonight...

		ROBBIE
	No man come on, I don't want any.

		JIM
	...just a little lick, come on trust 
	me... for old times, the four of us, 
	let's get together one more time,... 
	the Doors man... Please. For me.

Something so sincere in Jim's eyes. Robbie takes the fatal 
lick. Jim smiles manically as the NUREMBERG SOUNDS of the 
CROWD drown them out.

		ROBBIE
	You said you love pain man, but you 
	run from it every chance you get.

INT. STAGE - SAME NIGHT

The DOORS come out finally. The noise is overwhelming. Acid, 
light, noise. Wagnerian Gods, Hitler...

JIM spreading his arms like Icarus set to fly. The ROARS 
redouble, their FEET stomping out:

		CROWD
		(insane)
	DOORS DOORS DOORS DOORS...

Joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at Jim's feet. 
He is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up.

COPS everywhere looking as...

He lights it. The CROWD going nuts as the DOORS go into the 
ominous introductory strains of FIVE TO ONE trying to get 
the onus off Jim and the show on the road. The Audience knows 
the song, go into a primal FOOT STOMP with it. Bras are thrown 
on stage. Kids writhe madly in the primal Doors dance.

People with SPARKLERS running through the hangar. CAMERA 
FLASHBULBS popping throughout the show... get Jim on film 
while you can.

Jim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics 
right off, forcing the Doors to circle the beat again. He 
jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire.

		JIM
	ARE YOU READY!!!!
		(beat)
	ARE YOU REAAAAAAADYYYYYYYYY!!

The Crowd explodes once more. As a COP heads upstage to get 
Jim for the joint -- he cooly flicks it back into the crowd, 
avoiding disaster. Perfect timing as the Cop looks around, 
suddenly distracted by:

The Crowd yelling something. An INSANE TEENAGER stands on 
the railing of a balcony above the auditorium, poised to 
swan dive some 18 feet into the crowd. Which he now does, 
arms held out like wings.

The Crowd yells, parting to allow his bulk to smack the floor. 
Pause. Cops rushing to the spot. The KID suddenly stands up, 
unhurt, with a stoned out look on his face.

		TEENAGER
	Wow!

Then splits at a full run thru the crowd chased by the 
perplexed Cops. Everybody surging back towards the stage as 
JIM looses one of his primal SCREAMS.

		JIM
	YAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW... Love my 
	girl!
		(song)
	Five to one 
	One in five 
	No one here gets out alive 
	You gets your baby 
	I'll get mine 
	Gonna make it, baby 
	If we try

He slobbers, drunk, slouches, stumbles, regains his balance. 
The Crowd loves it, but Ray senses something wrong. Robbie 
starts to feel the effects of the acid Jim gave him -- his 
eyes registering fear.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	The old get old 
	The young get stronger 
	May take a week 
	And it may take longer 
	They got the guns 
	But we got the numbers 
	Gonna win yeah -- WE'RE TAKING OVER!!

During the instrumental break, Jim picks up one of the roses 
from the floor, pokes it at John on the drums, who whacks it 
to death on his skins. Jim starts to whirl the mike cord 
like a slingshot or bolo, in an ever-widening arc...

...it flies off and smashes into the head of the PROMOTER at 
the edge of the stage arguing with SIDDONS. The man is 
staggered, weaving, Siddons helping him to a FIRST AID TEAM.

		JIM
	YAAAAAAOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!

The crazy VEGETERIAN HIPPIE runs out on stage to give Jim 
the white lamb to make this political point. Jim holds the 
lamb in his arms. It's purring, gentle. DOG chases the HIPPIE 
off as he gives the microphone back to Jim and takes the 
lamb from him... he staggers over to ROBBIE and goes down to 
his knees, pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned 
guitar solo.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Your ballroom days are over baby 
	Night is drawing near 
	Shadows of the evening 
	Crawl across the years 
	You walk across the floor 
	With a flower in your hand 
	Tryin to tell me no one understands

PHOTOGRAPHERS flashing cameras. BAKER urging him on from the 
wings as he passes out. A GIRL runs onto the stage, dumps a 
bottle of champagne on Jim's head. Jim takes his shirt off, 
soaking wet. The CROWD is also stripping in the heat, shirts, 
blouses, screaming so much now they are obviously way past 
listening to any song. It has become a view of the future -- 
the NAKED GIRL and BOY dancing stark naked drugged out in 
the middle of it all, the FAT GIRL prowling naked on the 
edge of the stage before she's arrested, the FIGHTS in the 
Crowd, fists, blood, a black man chased and beaten, the sense 
of Altamont here, the hippie flower trip gone to shit -- 
it's all come down here tonight, the end of an era.

		JIM &amp; DOORS
	Trade in your hours for a handful of 
	dimes 
	Gonna make it baby -- in our prime 
	Get together one more time 
	Get together

He stops singing suddenly, squinting out into the madness. 
The arena echoes with the uncomprehending chant of the Mob...

		MOB
	...one more time 
	Get together one more time 
	Get together one more time

SPECIAL EFFECT -- the INDIAN GHOST is leaving Jim's body -- 
spectrally moving off him, hovering there in the air, its 
eyes -- the face of a dying Indian on an Arizona highway -- 
then gone. A moment, only three, four beats. An optical 
illusion? Maybe. Or is it saying, 'now you are just a white 
man'... maybe not. As it drifts off in a cloud, into the 
vast audience's EYEBALL.

		JIM
	YOU'RE ALL A BUNCHA FUCKIN SLAVES!!!

The instruments continue to vamp but there's a hush to the 
CROWD.

		JIM
	Lettin people tell you what you're 
	gonna do! Lettin people push you 
	around! How long you think it's gonna 
	last! How long you gonna let them 
	push you around!!

He waits. INTERCUTS of the FACES in the crowd.

		VOICES
		(ignoring Jim)
	"Light My Fire"! Play "Light My 
	Fire"!! Come on Jim...
		(some boos sprinkled 
		in)
	Take your clothes off man! Get wild! 
	Fuck me baby. Fuck me girl, suck my 
	cock honey around the world! Mexican 
	whore suck my prick! Keeper of the 
	royal sperm man! CELEBRATE THE LIZARD 
	MAN, DRAIN IT MOTHERFUCKER!!

		JIM
	C'MON GET IT ALL OUT! ALL THE LITTLE 
	HATREDS, Everything inside you... 
	LET ME HAVE IT!

		CROWD
	FUCK YOU!

		JIM
	THAT'S THE ONE LITTLE WORD I WANTED 
	TO HEAR! THAT'S THE VERY LITTLE WORD! 
	THE WHOLE WORLD HATES ME! THE WHOLE 
	FUCKING WORLD HATES ME!

		VOICE
		(girl)
	SAVE US... SAVE US, JIM... JIM! 
	EEEE... I TOUCHED HIM.

		JIM
	Maybe you love it, maybe you love 
	gettin your faces pressed into the 
	shit of the world! You'd all eat 
	shit wouldn't ya!! Adolph Hitler is 
	ALIVE AND WELL HERE IN MIAMI!! YOU'RE 
	ALL A BUNCHA SLAVES!!

The Crowd BOOS back at him, surging suddenly with hatred for 
Jim. Intercut the Crowd -- feel this hatred.

		JIM
	WHAT ARE YA GONNA DO ABOUT IT! WHAT 
	ARE YA GONNA DO ABOUT IT! WHAT ARE 
	YA GONNA DO ABOUT IT!

The Band has petered out by this point but out of nowhere, 
ROBBIE, zonked on his version of LSD, starts up with "TOUCH 
ME BABE."

		JIM &amp; DOORS
		(going with it)
	Come on, come on, come on and FUCK 
	me babe! Can't you see that I am not 
	afraid
		(cuts the music)
	HEY WAIT A MINUTE...
		(music cuts off 
		raggedly)
	Miami Beach Florida hunh? I was BORN 
	and RAISED not far from here... went 
	to Florida State...
		(cheers)
	Then I GOT SMART. I went to California 
	where you can let your hair grow 
	long and walk down the street without 
	people calling you a FREAK... They're 
	trying to CHANGE THE WORLD out there 
	in California.

		VOICES
	Yeah, STOP THE WAR MAN, PEACEEE... 
	WE LOVE YA JIM.

		JIM
	NO I'm not talkin' 'bout NO 
	REVOLUTION. I'm not talkin 'bout no 
	DEMONSTRATION. I'm talking 'bout 
	HAVING SOME FUN. I'm talkin' 'bout 
	DANCIN. I'm talkin 'bout LOVE. I'm 
	talkin' 'bout some LOVE. LOVE LOVE 
	LOVE LOVE... LOVE!!!! Grab your friend -- 
	and LOVE him. Come oooooaaaannnnn. 
	Yeah!

Jim pulling his shirt off -- barechested -- waving it like a 
toreador in front of his leather crotch.

		VOICES
		(cheers, giggles)
	"Light My Fire"! Come on Jim -- play 
	"Light My Fire"!

The audience seems to be paying no attention to what he is 
doing or saying, which drives him to deeper rage.

		JIM
	Ain't nobody gonna love my ass? Come 
	on... I need ya. There's so many of 
	ya out there and nobody's gonna love 
	me! C'mon -- what'cha come here for 
	anyway? You didn't come here for 
	music. You didn't come here to see a 
	good band. You came here for THIS 
	didn't ya...

He saunters to the edge of the stage. Hisses at them. He 
clasps his crotch, leering at a cute LITTLE GIRL in the front 
row, shaking it at her. Her BOYFRIEND, pissed at Jim, runs 
for the stage. Jim unzips his leathers.

		JIM
	I'm lonely out here -- Ya wanna SEE 
	IT... COME ON SWEETHEART... I need 
	it, I NEED IT, need ya, need ya, 
	NEED YA, COME OOOOOAAAANNNNNNN...

Chaos, confusion now erupt in the crowd! The BOYFRIEND is 
running at JIM as the BODYGUARDS throw him back into the 
crowd. Jim flicking his shirt over his crotch, back and forth 
like a drunken matador. The Doors look at each other, don't 
know what's going to happen.

		JIM
	Didja see it! You wanna see it 
	AGAIN???

The crowd roars its approval. Confusion reigns. Drunken 
CATCALLS. Things, bras, cans thrown at the stage.

		VOICES
		(ad lib)
	Take it off! Take it all off!

		JIM
	What if I pull it out fer ya!! And 
	SHAKE IT AROUND!!! Will that do it 
	for you! Would ya, would ya, would 
	ya!! Now watch -- I'm gonna show it 
	to ya!

He feigns opening his belt and exposing himself, flipping 
his shirt back and forth over the crotch in a mock striptease.

		JIM
	There it was! Ya see it? Ya see it?... 
	Ya wanna see it again?

A flock of TEENAGE GIRLS are sure they've seen it, hysterical.

		TEENAGE GIRL
	I saw it!... Yes, yes! Jim! Jim!

		TEENAGE GIRL 2
	Where? I didn't see it.

		JIM
		(roaring out his 
		commands)
	COME ON UP HERE AND LOVE MY ASS! I 
	WANNA SEE SOME ACTION OUT THERE! I 
	WANNA SEE SOME ACTION OUT THERE! I 
	WANNA SEE SOME ACTION OUT THERE! I 
	WANNA SEE SOME ACTION OUT THERE! I 
	WANT YOU TO LOVE MY ASS! I WANT SOME 
	LOVE... LOVE... LOVE... LOVE C'MON, 
	C'MON... NO LIMITS, NO LAWS YOU WANNA 
	FUCK? COME ON! COME ON UP HERE!!!!!

He looks like he's really gonna tear it all off now. A flash 
of boxer shorts. RAY moving. SIDDONS moving. DOG getting to 
him first, wrapping him in a bearhug from behind, lifting 
him holding his pants up.

		VINCE THE ROADIE
	DON'T DO IT MAN. DON'T DO IT!

		RAY
	HEY JIM.

		JIM
	C'MON! C'MON! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO 
	LIMITS, NO LAWS! NO LIMITS, NO LAWS!

The place is in PANDEMONIUM now. GIRLS jumping on stage and 
dancing with Jim still in Vince the Roadie's bearhug. Another 
RIOT... COPS fighting the TEENAGERS off the stage, now 
wobbling under the weight.

		PROMOTER
		(pissed, head bandaged)
	GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE! GET OFF 
	THE FUCKING STAGE!!
		(stiffarms Jim off 
		the stage)

RAY starts playing BREAK ON THROUGH trying to keep things 
normal.

JIM now out there in the arena in a CONGA LINE, doing his 
rain dance, hands on hips, the TEENAGERS forming a long snake 
behind him.

The huge speaker columns teeter and fall. A corner of the 
STAGE now COLLAPSES from the weight, PEOPLE spilling on the 
floor, screams. The power console tips over next to DENSMORE. 
He bails. Manzarek and Krieger follow.

The PROMOTER is yelling at SIDDONS about his insurance 
contract as the COPS and FBI AGENTS close in, looking for 
Jim.

		COPS
	Where's the guy with the penis!

Who is out there leading his naked drunken FLOCK, hundreds 
of them in a phallic Pied Piper dance thru the darkened 
seaplane hanger. From BREAK ON THROUGH PART TWO:

		JIM ET AL &amp; DOORS
	You know the day destroys the night 
	Night divides the day 
	Try to run, try to hide 
	BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE 
	BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE 
	BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE 
	Dead cats! Dead rats! Did you see 
	what they were at Dead cat in a top 
	hat! Sucking on a young man's blood 
	Fat cat in a top hat 
	Thinks he's an aristocrat 
	Thinks he can kill and slaughter 
	Thinks he can shoot my daughter 
	Dead cats! Dead rats! Think you're 
	an aristocrat Crap, that's crap

Ray watching from the corner of the stage, littered with 
bras, bottles, shirts, shoes, socks, panties, hats, broken 
equipment, debris -- the end of the dream. The Doors as a 
live band are dead.

									DISSOLVING TO:

INT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY (1970)

The "Charges" are being read by the JUDGE, distant, not of 
this world. The court is lit in southern gothic daylight, 
ghostly chiaroscuro, all colors bled. Camera moving along 
the sweaty white faces of the six older JURORS, all of them 
straight "silent majority"... past the PROSECUTOR, his shadow 
cutting the jury box... onto JIM bearded, smoking 2 packs a 
day, a deep racking cough, sitting with his elder ATTORNEY... 
RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, PAMELA, OTHERS in support are there in 
background. The trial is going down like a morphine dream, 
Jim featured in diopter close-up.

		JUDGE VOICE
	...you are charged under four counts 
	with lewd behavior, simulated 
	masturbation, public drunkenness, 
	profanity, and public exposure.

A blues riff goes by -- brief, ghostly from RUNNING BLUE.

JIM SONG 
Poor Otis dead and gone 
Left me here to sing his song 
Pretty little girl with the red dress on 
Poor Otis dead and gone

		JIM (V.O.)
	I can't believe this is happening 
	I can't believe all these people are 
	sniffing each other &amp; backing away, 
	teeth grinning, hair raised, growling, 
	here in the slaughtered wind 
	This is it 
	No more fun the death of all joy has 
	come

The PRESS SECTION is full as Jim's older LAWYER argues in 
front of the JURY, a distant voice.

		LAWYER
	Your Honor, I would like to bring to 
	the Court's attention the contemporary 
	Broadway musical "Hair" in which 
	cast members disrobe and appear naked 
	on the stage.

		JUDGE
		(pounds his gavel)
	Inadmissable evidence.

		JIM VOICE OVER
	I had a vision of America 
	Seen from the air 28,000 ft. &amp; going 
	fast 
	A one-armed man in a Texas parking 
	labyrinth 
	A burnt tree like a giant primeval 
	bird in an empty lot in Fresno

								SUPERIMPOSITION:

		LAWYER
	Your Honor... any difference from 
	the Miami nightclubs where comedians 
	frequently incorporate profanity 
	into their acts

		JUDGE
		(gavel)
	Inadmissable evidence.

		JIM VOICE OVER
	Miles &amp; miles of hotel corridors &amp; 
	elevators, filled with citizens 
	Motel 
	Money 
	Murder, Madness 
	Change the mood from glad to sadness 
	Play the ghost song baby

The backbeat of WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER starts, into its 
spiralling descent.

								SUPERIMPOSITION:

		LAWYER
		(distant)
	...there has not been one shred of 
	evidence: 300 photographs and not 
	one shows a thing; not reliable 
	testimony, nothing but hysterical 
	heresay

The PRESS is bored, their numbers reduced. The spectators 
have changed from kids to OLDER PEOPLE intent on preserving 
their way of life. A TAPE is playing of Jim's devil voice at 
the concert, cursing: "Come on up here. No limits! No laws", 
etc... (screams, obscenity)

JIM &amp; DOORS 
(SONG) 
When the music's over (3) 
Turn out the lights (3) 
For the music is your special friend 
Dance on fire as it intends 
Music is your only friend 
Until the end (2)

										SUPERIMPOSITION TO:

		LAWYER
	...this is a major First Amendment 
	violation by the Police and 
	Politicians of Miami. Every witness 
	they've brought has admitted under 
	oath to not actually seeing the 
	client's genitals -- except one who...

The PRESS section is now down to about THREE bored FACES, 
one of them PATRICIA KENNEALY who looks pregnant.

JIM smiles at her.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MIAMI BEACH - DAY

The MUSIC continuing into a long backbeat without lyrics -- 
emphasizing the downward spiralling theme...

		JIM
	...Well, you gonna get rid of it? 
	Fucked up people y'know, crazies, 
	unwanted Indians just throw it in 
	the river.

Pause. PATRICIA -- four and a half months pregnant, stares. 
A glary window onto a balcony overlooking the sea with Florida 
palms and a strip of beach. A room in a highrise hotel. Jim's 
mess is everywhere.

		PATRICIA
	I can't fucking believe you just 
	said that!

		JIM
	Patricia, wouldn't it be better to 
	have a kid with someone who wanted 
	to be its father?

		PATRICIA
	It'd be a fucking genius, that's 
	what it'd be! You and me. The child 
	would be a god, goddess!

		JIM
	It'd be a monster.

A look. She's stunned, ugly wrath gathering. He tries to 
soothe her.

		JIM
	I got this trial dragging on me, 
	Patricia. I couldn't support the kid -- 
	I can't afford it and I don't want 
	the responsibility right now.

		PATRICIA
	You're a COWARD!! A LITTLE BOY!! The 
	only way you can't afford it is 
	emotionally. You forgot your vows 
	man. They were forever in the goddess' 
	sight. Death doesn't part, only love 
	Jim!

		JIM
	Come on Patricia, I was stoned... it 
	seemed like the fun thing at the 
	time.

She pulls a dagger with a skull's head on it, goes for him.

		PATRICIA
	I'm gonna cut your balls off Morrison!

		JIM
		(that smile)
	You want 'em?

		PATRICIA
		(beat)
	FUCK YOU. I'm gonna have the kid.

		JIM
	Then it'll be your kid. If you want 
	the abortion I'll pay for it and 
	I'll come up to New York to be with 
	you when you have it.

		PATRICIA
	No you won't.

		JIM
	Yes I will.

		PATRICIA
	Bullshit Morrison
		(release him, stalks)
	You know who you are...
		(pause)
	NO. What difference does it make. 
	You know, you never pretended. I 
	did. I don't even like kids 
	particularly,
		(laughs to herself)
	but I don't want the other thing 
	either. I guess what I really want 
	is to throw myself off this fucking 
	balcony
		(Hurls the knife out 
		off the balcony)
	Well now that you've fucked the 
	future, Morrison, have you fucked 
	everything?...
		(cruelly)
	Have you looked at yourself in the 
	mirror. Your stomach...

		JIM
		(hurt, near tears)
	Please don't say those things to me, 
	Patricia.

She suddenly grasps him, clutching, hunger, lust.

		PATRICIA
	Fuck me one last time, you worthless 
	piece of shit.

JIM &amp; DOORS 
...the scream of the butterfly 
Come back baby 
Back into my arms

On Jim's face.

EXT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY

TWO HUNDRED PERSONS are gathered on the lawn outside, banners 
decrying the Doors. A MIDDLE AGED SPEAKER, clean cut, squarely 
dressed, expresses his outrage.

		SPEAKER
		(bullhorn)
	...endorsed by President Richard 
	Nixon!
		(cheers)
	The immoral conduct of degenerates 
	such as Jim Morrison is an 
	unacceptable insult to this country 
	and the principles for which it 
	stands...

JIM &amp; DOORS 
(OVER) 
We're getting tired of hanging around 
Waiting around with our heads to the ground 
I hear the gentle sound 
Very near yet very far 
Very soft, yeah, very clear 
Come today, come today

		JIM
	Well uh, it's designed to wear you 
	down y'know... when that rap sheet 
	says the "United States of America 
	versus You" it takes you down day by 
	day, specially when no one really 
	gives a shit about, y'know, the First 
	Amendment that's on trial here... 
	Nobody says anything about that, 
	it's just uh did you take your pants 
	off y'know, I mean that's not what 
	it's about, it's about freedom, that's 
	what it's about... but who cares, 
	right? Freedom exists in a schoolbook.

		REPORTER 1
		(disinterested)
	...but the promoters are cancelling 
	your shows, will this affect the way 
	you play?

		JIM
	Well, I can only open doors, M'am. I 
	can't drag people thru 'em. I'm no 
	savior.

		REPORTER 2
	But you've called yourself a shaman?

		JIM
		(beat, pained)
	Did I? Well, I'll tell ya, my words 
	stand a far better chance of being 
	around a hundred years from now than 
	my waistline.

As he goes into the courtroom, a dolled up REPORTER 1, the 
local anchor-lady turns to her camera.

		ANCHORLADY
	The question that will be answered 
	today: Did Jim Morrison or did he 
	not take off his pants last March? 
	This is...

INT. COURTROOM - THAT DAY

The judge passing sentence, distant, hazy under song. Darkened 
shadows across the floor, silhouettes... the world bleak and 
white...

		JUDGE
	James Douglas Morrison, I hereby 
	sentence you to sixty days of hard 
	labor in the Dade County Jail and 
	for public exposure I am sentencing 
	you to six months of the same, after 
	which you are to serve two years and 
	four months of probationary time. 
	[...]

	sleep, get a massage, go to the 
	dentist, get a haircut honey, you 
	gotta cool out...

		JOHN
	Probably a bath too...

		OFFICE BOY
		(reading a rock 
		magazine)
	Jesus Jim, this guy really despises 
	you.

		JOHN
	...didn't invite us to Woodstock. 
	Twenty other groups but not...

		SIDDONS
	What's heavy is the radio stations 
	pulling us from their playlists. The 
	big cities -- Philly, Cinci, Chicago, 
	Detroit -- it's insane! Record sales 
	suck!

		RAY
		(with irony, reading 
		something)
	"The band you love to hate".

		LAWYER
		(2nd Lawyer if 
		necessary)
	We can drag this appeal out for years, 
	we can keep you out of jail.

		JIM
		(drinking)
	You're drinking with number three.

		SIDDONS
	Max firmly believes the FBI's behind 
	it. We're subpoenaing their records -- 
	they had memos on you in Phoenix and 
	they got you extradicted to Miami 
	illegally without a felony...

		MIKE
	A new image -- Jim Morrison as 
	"Renaissance Man" -- We bring you 
	back slow, quiet, the beard, elder 
	of the tribe.

		OFFICE BOY
		(reading from review)
	...like Lennon said "you either grow 
	with the music or it grows without 
	you."

		ROBBIE
	Hey, it was fun.

All the voices merging into one:

		VOICES
	First Hendrix now Janis Robbie flew

Jim, during this, picking up the TV remote, flicking on the 
images. The VOICES blending with TV VOICES as he swithes the 
channels. The camera moving in on Jim, the VOICES fading. 
All we see is Jim. All we hear and see is the TV:

		TELEVISION
	Chicago Seven in it's tenth day... 
	Bobby Seale gagged and chained...
		(click)
	L.A. shootout with Black Panthers...

The SONG climaxes into an inner scream of madness.

JIM &amp; DOORS

Silence on Jim.

		JIM
		(mildly)
	I think I'm having a nervous 
	breakdown.

The sound of wind, the backbeat of LA WOMAN flooding in.

EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

JIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the 
20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the 
card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below. The song 
LA WOMAN continues born from this renewed feeling of danger.

JIM &amp; DOORS 
Well I just got into town 'bout an hour ago 
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow 
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows

PAM screaming for him to come back from the edge as TOM BAKER 
and MIKE and DOG and a CAMERAMAN film in 16mm.

		PAM
	JIM! PLEASE GODDAMIT!! COME BACK IN 
	PLEASE!!

JIM yelling back, as he drinks from a pint of whiskey, 
enjoying himself enormously.

		JIM
	Whatcha worried about? I like it out 
	here.

He feigns a fall.

		PAM
	NOOOOOO!!

RAY and SIDDONS arrive, terrified, looking for him.

		JIM
		(laughing at Pam)
	Life on the edge baby. Come get me 
	if you love me baby.

		PAM
	PLEASE GODDAMIT JIM MORRISON I'M NOT 
	GONNA KILL MYSELF FOR YOU. GET IN 
	HERE.

Jim cracking up with laughter. BAKER, drunk and the FILM 
CREW love it, swishpanning with a cheap sungun.

		MIKE
		(dancing)
	We got it man! Keep going. Great get 
	a two shot.

		BAKER
	GO ON GET OUT THERE PAM.

Pam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start 
climbing out onto the ledge, skirts blowing in the wind.

		PAM
	JIM MORRISON GODDAMIT I LOVE YOU I 
	WANT YOU I NEED YOU.

Jim moving further along the ledge.

		JIM
		(raw)
	YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S BULLSHIT! YOU LOVE

Siddons and Ray terrified. Is this the night it's finally 
going to end in a suicide plunge? Ray trying to stop Pam, 
too late.

		RAY
	Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances 
	man...

Pam's moving shakily along the ledge, cracked on downers.

Jim watching her come, amazed at her risk.

		RAY
		(yelling down)
	JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall.

		TOM
	Jump!

He watches, does nothing.

		JIM
	Come on baby, come on.

		RAY
		(trying another tack)
	Jim we gotta finish "LA Woman".

		JIM
	Don't have an ending Ray.

Reaches his hand out. She is closer. But shaky.

		RAY
		(white)
	They're both gonna die... ARE YOU 
	HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!!

Ray goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle. 
Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the 
ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and 
death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of 
the Chateau reach their hands out for each other.

		JIM
	Come on baby, come on

		PAM
		(quoting him)
	"...but one, the most beautiful one 
	of all -- dances in a ring of fire --

	"I see your hair is burning. If they 
	say I never loved you, you know they 
	are a liar!"

		PAM
	"...and throws off the challenge 
	with a shrug"

		JIM
	All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!!

She has never been so concentrated, inching closer to him. 
Her heels overhanging oblivion.

		PAM
	I don't wanna die with you Jim 
	Morrison, I don't wanna die!

JIM &amp; DOORS 
Never saw a woman 
So alone (X2) 
So alone -- lone lone

		JIM
	C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it 
	right here! Right now! You and me!

Ray, Tom, Siddons, Mike, Dog, they all watch in horror, 
sensing it will happen. They have even stopped filming. 
Inches... inches.

He dodges her touch, confused... to the last possible second. 
Then SHE'S THERE -- in his arms. Her arms latch around him 
and she hugs him with all her wiry soul.

		PAM
	Jim -- let's go, let's leave this 
	town! You and me! Never come back.

		JIM
		(demonic)
	We can. Right now. Just one more 
	step...

		PAM
	No Jim. I want to LIVE with you. I 
	want to LIVE with you.

The two lovers huddled together on the ledge. He slips his 
head down on her lap, looking up into her eyes with the 
strangest tears in his eyes.

		JIM
		(a poem)
	There was preserved in her the fresh 
	miracle of surprise... clothed in 
	sunlight restless in wanting dying 
	of fever married to doubt how it has 
	changed you how slowly estranged you 
	solely arranged you beg for your 
	mercy -- OR -- ...but all will pass 
	lie down in green grass and smile 
	and muse and gaze upon her smooth 
	resemblance to the mating-Queen who 
	it seems is in love with the horseman 
	Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my 
	birth I want to be ready.

On her face -- moved. Pause. LA WOMAN floods in on his smile, 
an upbeat surge.

Upstairs, the ONLOOKERS relax. HOTEL MANAGEMENT and COPS are 
now rushing up in background.

We see RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, BOTNICK, a BASS and 2nd RHYTHM

Wires run into a tiny toilet revealing JIM with headphones

		(picks up Robin)
	How's my girl! And how's my boy!

They stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. A 
bearded Santa Claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy, 
body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos 
about him and still a charisma that the children react to 
without thinking. He gives out the presents all over.

		JIM
		(ad libs)
	For you... Pancho gets this one... 
	Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't 
	grab now... open that one, that's 
	yours... keep your paws off that 
	now...

As RAY and ROBBIE and JOHN and the others circle him.

		JIM
		(to Robin, a 5 year 
		old)
	...and to you, princess, from your 
	Royal servant, James Douglas Morrison
		(bows)

As ROBIN, the cutest of them all, a bow in her hair, takes 
the package, opens it.

		RAY
	You wanna hear the new mixes on "LA 
	WOMAN?"...

		JIM
	No, I gotta plane to catch.

		JOHN
	Won't take long man, it's the best 
	one since "Days".

		ROBBIE
	We added rain to "Riders", come on.

Jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner 
room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful, 
ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed, 
velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron 
or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly 
weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic 
gift, meant from the heart. It stops everybody -- they all 
look. A haunted quality to the doll.

		KID
	Ugh! What's that!

		ROBIN
		(to Jim)
	It's you.

		JIM
	Forever young...

She kisses him.

		ROBIN
	Oh it's beautiful... Thank you Uncle 
	Jim.

INT. RAY'S WORK SPACE - DAY

Off the patio windows of the birthday party, sounds and 
sunshine pouring in. The Clown running around, laughter. The 
music plays -- BRUCE at the mixing board.

JIM &amp; DOORS 
Riders on the Storm (x2) 
Into this house we're born 
Into this world we're thrown 
Like a dog without a bone 
An actor out on loan 
Riders on the storm

Where we and Jim came in, I guess. Jim drinks from a cognac 
bottle straight, foot tapping, enjoying it, knows it's good -- 
but other things are calling. This is history.

		JIM
	I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for 
	four guys who weren't even talking 
	that day.

Slapping shoulders, shaking hands.

		JOHN
	You really gonna live in Paris man?

		JIM
	Yeah John, be anonymous, write a 
	book: "Observations of an American 
	While on Trial in Miami".

		ROBBIE
	I still think we got a couple of 
	great blues albums in us man.

		JIM
	I'm pinned man. Everything I do they 
	got a category for it, y'know. 
	Freedom's gone.

		JOHN
	Hey, I'm gonna miss you Jim. I'm 
	gonna miss the feeling of playing 
	music with you.

		JIM
	You can always whip the horses' eyes. 
	You, John, miss me?

		JOHN
	More than you think asshole.
		(turn away, repressing -- 
		the emotions)

		ROBBIE
		(walking him to the 
		garden)
	Well far as I'm concerned, Jim, I 
	made music with Dionysus man. We had 
	some moments on stage like no one 
	will ever fucking know.

		JIM
		(making light)
	Yeah, yeah -- and you lay off those 
	drugs Rob. We're gonna play again 
	some day.

		ROBBIE
	Jim -- "do not go gently into that 
	good night. Rage rage against the 
	dying of the light".
		(he winks goodbye)

The kids running up to grab JIM, pulls him back to the party.

		GIRLS
	Come 'ere Uncle Jim, we're playing 
	blind man's bluff...

										TIME CUT TO:

EXT. GARDEN - LATER DAY

JIM, a bearded Santa Claus with the birthday hat on his head, 
surrounded by the GIRLS and BOYS and DOROTHY shooting a home 
movie. They're eating birthday cake but UNCLE JIM is drinking 
straight from the cognac bottle -- a strange sight.

		JIM
		(to Robin)
	So what are you gonna be when you 
	grow up?

		ROBIN
	I wanna be your wife

He laughs, looks at Dorothy who's shooting him with the Super 
8.

		JIM
	I don't know, can I afford you? Pam 
	kinda wiped me out with her dress 
	store y'know...

		ROBIN
	I'll make my own dresses and you'll 
	see, I'll be the best wife.

		DOROTHY
		(nodding)
	You'll never be alone Jim.

		JIM
		(to Dorothy)
	You know I've never been happier. 
	Not as much of a rush as I used to 
	be in y'know... this is the strangest 
	life I've ever known.

His eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting 
down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on 
his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems 
familiar. Jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. As he fades. 
We saw the Boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in 
the Arizona desert.

Jim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table, 
the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the 
kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose -- he doesn't wake 
up.

										TIME CUT TO:

As Ray comes over now, rouses him gently.

		RAY
	Gotta plane to catch man?

Jim coming awake in that instant alert way of his, but 
obviously hung over.

		JIM
	O?... splittling headache from which 
	the future is made.

Puzzling remark, He gets up, shaky, exits, kids tearing at 
him. Goodbyes.

EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - TWILIGHT

The beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players 
and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS 
from within.

		RAY
	Is Pam really there in Paris waiting?

		JIM
		(ironic, head hurts)
	Sure. The Count's there so where 
	else would she be? Gotta try to start 
	over, without all the hassles, y'know. 
	I think we can.

		RAY
	I never knew what you saw in that 
	nightmare chick man.

		JIM
	Well she is kinda flakey -- like me. 
	I mean she's just so vulnerable about 
	everything. It makes me sad man.
		(pause)
	But she's always kinda believed in 
	something about me y'know -- her 
	little picture of me as the unsung 
	poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda 
	dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live.

		RAY
	I don't know man, I don't wanna sound 
	like your old man but you're only 
	27, you're living like you gotta get 
	it all in, you gotta slow down man, 
	you did it, you broke thru to the 
	other side.

		JIM
	We didn't break thru Ray, we just 
	pushed things a little. When you 
	really break thru, there's nothing 
	left. No music, no Doors, no God, 
	nothing -- only a will to power.

		RAY
	I don't believe that. You were an 
	American prince, man -- with overbred 
	genes --
		(Jim scoffs, laughs)
	No! What could've been Jim? You 
	could've been President.
		(Jim cracks up)
	No man! What could've been Jim? We 
	stood here on this beach on the edge 
	of the Pacific that crazy summer day 
	in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we 
	knew we were at the edge of the mind. 
	we were there, man. One planet, one 
	globe, one mind. Consciousness, we 
	raised it, we were there.

Jim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused.

		JIM
	And now what?

		RAY
	Now?
		(smiles, lethally 
		sweet)
	You've made me into Ishmael. I am 
	the last survivor of the Pequod. And 
	I exist only to tell the story of 
	Ahab who fought the black whale.

		JIM
		(loves it, laughs)
	It was white Ray. You gotta stop 
	harpin' on that day. I was so ripped 
	I can hardly remember it.

Ignites engine. Ray leans in, lightening up.

		RAY
	Hey, what was that poem you once 
	wrote about two chicks on the pier?

		JIM
	Come on man, I gotta fly.

		RAY
	Come on. Just once.

		JIM
		(VOICE OVER, pulling 
		out the car)
	In that year we had a great 
	Visitation of energy 
	Back in those days 
	Everything was simpler and more 
	confused 
	One summer night, going to the pier 
	I ran into two young girls 
	The blonde was called Freedom 
	The dark one Enterprise 
	We talked 
	And they told me this story.

As he departs, waving.

		RAY
		(OVER)
	What was the story?

His point of view -- Jim receding into the sun in his mustang -- 
making a shakey, screeching curve at the bend of the beach. 
And he's gone. An ominous ROAR of an AIRPLANE above RAY. -- 
flying away.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - TWILIGHT

The PLANE flies off into the setting ball of red sun.

INT. RECORDING SESSION (LAST SESSION) - L.A. - DEC.

The bearded POET hunches in his chair, exhausted, clutching 
the paper, finished. Pause. He downs a final shot, grunts to 
the Indian Ghostman sitting there on a stool watching him in 
the corner of the studio. The Ghostman laughs (but nothing 
comes out of his mouth). His wrinkled eyes are happy, 
feathered ponytail, he nods... pleased.

		MORRISON
	Well, didja get all that?

		GHOSTMAN
	You done good, Jim, go now -- rest

The ENGINEER, exhausted, doesn't feel anything funny.

		ENGINEER
	Yeah, I got it Jim.

The poets face brightens. A small but ever-so-sweet smile of 
triumph hikes up the corners of his mouth.

		JIM
	Aw right. Let's get some tacos!

He stands, sways, than moves out of view. The empty bottle 
of whiskey, its sands run out, is left behind.

As we FADE OUT, a hardy, mischievous Morrison laugh and a 
ripple of sensuous MUSIC carry us into the lilting, lamenting 
strains of AN AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END without lyrics for 
now as we cut to:

INT. PARIS BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN (NIGHT) (1971)

PAMELA is agitated in her sleep -- waking as she feels him 
watching. Is that him? At the door? A SHADOW -- leaves. 
Footsteps moving down the narrow Parisian corridor with the 
creaky floor.

		PAM
	Jim... that you?

Looks at the time. Somewhere near dawn. The sounds of a bath 
being drawn. Nightmare or sleep? She tries to fade back to 
sleep but the MUSIC and the WHISPERING prod her, pull her 
awake...

DISSOLVE: SAME FACE -- AN HOUR LATER.

Putting her robe on, the slippers, the light... moving. She 
is much more ravaged looking than before.

INT. BATHROOM - DAWN

She finds him now... His face floating upwards, angelic eyes, 
the beard is now gone, a little smile on his face. He must 
be playing another joke. Although she really knows as she 
says the words:

		PAM
	Jim! It was you. I always know when 
	it's you.
		(moving closer)
	Come on baby get out of the tub... 
	mama'll dry you off...
		(pause)
	Jim Morrison, now you stop joking 
	you hear me, cut it out!

His face. At peace, as she sobs, the MUSIC cresting to Jim's 
lyrics.

		PAM
	...was it all right Jim, did you 
	enjoy it when it came my baby? Just 
	like you said it'd be?

		JIM
		(OVER)
	They are waiting to take us into the 
	severed garden do you know how pale 
	and wanton thrillful comes death at 
	a strange hour? Unannounced unplanned 
	for like a scaring overfriendly guest 
	you've brought to bed? Death makes 
	angels of us all? And gives us wings 
	where we had shoulders smooth as 
	raven's claws...

										DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY - PARIS - DAY

His face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of physical 
beauty. The camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves 
blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the 
crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around Jim's 
tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, Wilde, Bizet, Piaf, Chopin, 
Morrison...

		JIM
		(OVER)
	No more money, no more fancy dress 
	this other kingdom seems by far the 
	best until its other jaw reveals 
	incest and loose obedience to a 
	vegetable law. I will not go I prefer 
	a feast of friends to the giant 
	family...

The MUSIC rolling up on:

INT. CORRIDOR &amp; STAGE - LIMBO

Smoke. Some lights. The distant cheers of a CROWD. In slightly 
SLOW MOTION, a FIGURE moves down a corridor into a blinding 
light of stage and smoke. THREE OTHER SHADOWS are there 
waiting -- as the GHOST moves to the microphone in altered 
motion.

The AUDIENCE is out there somewhere in the dark -- we sense 
they too have become ghosts, as all of us will one day. The 
MUSIC continuing up to roll from AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END -- 
snatches we annotate.

		GHOST ANNOUNCER
	Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles 
	California -- The Doors!
		(ghostly applause)

		JIM &amp; THE DOORS
		(snatches)
	...have you seen the warm progress 
	under the stars? 
	Have you forgotten the keys to the 
	kingdom? 
	Have you been born yet and are you 
	alive? 
	Where is the feast we were promised? 
	Let's reinvent the gods, the myths 
	of the ages! 
	We need great golden copulations

Camera closing past the DOORS to JIM alone, circling the 
mike with his dance -- the INDIAN GHOSTMAN jigging, shaman-
like, off to the side -- now levitating above the stage, all 
crazy, gawky dancing.

		JIM
	Well, I'll tell you a story of 
	whiskey, mystics and men 
	And about the believers and how the 
	whole thing began 
	First there were women and children 
	obeying the moon 
	Then daylight brought wisdom and 
	sickness too soon... the moon is a 
	dry blood beast 
	We have assembled inside this ancient 
	and insane theatre to propagate our 
	lust for life and flee the swarming 
	wisdom of the streets we live we die 
	and death not ends it
		(screams in agony)
	FATHER HAVE MERCY!!!

Ending with a solitary sing-song croak.

		JIM
	Bird of prey, bird of prey 
	Flying high, flying high in the summer 
	sky 
	Bird of prey, bird of prey flying 
	high, flying high gently pass by 
	Bird of prey, bird of prey flying 
	high, flying high 
	Take me on your flight
		(pause then)
	I will come again down from the wild 
	mountains

THE SUBTITLE READS "JIM IS SAID TO HAVE DIED OF 'HEART 
FAILURE'. PAMELA JOINED HIM THREE YEARS LATER"... HER ASHES 
WERE BURIED NEXT TO HIM."
