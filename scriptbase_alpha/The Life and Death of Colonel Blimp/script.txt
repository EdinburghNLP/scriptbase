               THE RESURRECTION OF 'BLIMP'

               A NOTE ON THE SCRIPT AND FILM

               Michael Powell believed that 'Emeric's screenplay for Colonel 
               Blimp should be in every film archive, in every film 
               library.'* The question is, however, in what form? The text 
               printed here attempts something that is still rare in the 
               publication of screenplays and scripts. Usually these are 
               transcripts of what finally appeared on screen, based either 
               on the approved release script or simply on a description of 
               the dialogue and action. Occasionally an 'original' script 
               is published, although this is more common in cases where 
               that script has not been filmed and is therefore offered as 
               'literature'. The inevitable differences between script and 
               finished film are due to many factors, some creative, others 
               practical and circumstantial. A comparison of the original 
               and the result would therefore often be of little interest, 
               without a lengthy commentary on the production itself. In a 
               few cases, however, script and film remain relatively close 
               and the reasons for variation are interesting and 
               comprehensible. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is one 
               such case. There is only one known 'full script' version, 
               entitled The Life and Death of Sugar Candy' (clearly dating 
               from some time in June 1942. when it was hoped this concession 
               would win War Office approval). Subsequent memos identifying 
               scenes that were to be cut, changed and added indicate that 
               this remained

               * A Life in Movies, p. 409.

               The basis of the film's production (and its indications of 
               sequences already cut have been retained). What makes it 
               specially valuable is that it goes well beyond mere dialogue 
               and action, often describing location, character and 
               atmosphere in a highly suggestive way. Hence the decision to 
               present this script as written, together with a notation of 
               the film as it appears today. The system used is similar to 
               that devised by Bambi Ballard for her edition of Abel Gance's 
               script of Napoleon. This involves using double square brackets 
               [[ ]] to enclose original script material which does not 
               appear in the final film, and single square brackets [ ] for 
               material added during production. This means that in some 
               cases two variants of essentially the same speech appear 
               consecutively, which is not ideal, but hopefully the chance 
               to compare versions and trace shifts will compensate for any 
               local irritation. Names and titles which were changed in 
               production (such as Mullins to Murdoch, Colonel to General, 
               Die Walkure to Mignon) are given in their final form after 
               the first indication of a change.

               What of the film 'text' itself? This was originally released 
               in July 1943, running for 163 minutes. By the early 70s, the 
               only known versions of comparable length were two original 
               nitrate copies held by the British Film Institute Deposit 
               Print Collection and screened occasionally at the National 
               Film Theatre.* All other copies appeared to be, at most, 
               between 130 and 140 minutes. The Radio Times, billing the 
               first UK television transmission on Boxing Day 1972, quoted 
               BBC sources: 'this is the longest version we could find. But 
               rumour hath it the original ran over three hours!' The slot 
               allocated indicates an anticipated length of about 130 
               minutes.

               * One of these was donated by Powell and the other by Rank, 
               apparently in the late 50s.  I am grateful for this and other 
               information about versions to David Meeker, Keeper of Feature 
               Films at the National Film and Television Archive.

               When, how often, and by how much was Blimp cut? These are 
               the questions which still lack definitive answers, but some 
               reliable evidence and explanation can now be given. The US 
               Motion Picture Almanac lists Blimp for three consecutive 
               years, from 1944-45 to 1946-47, as belonging to 'Archers-
               General' and at its original length of 163 minutes.* 
               Correspondence in the Powell papers indicates that there was 
               considerable speculation about how to release it in the United 
               States; but despite the pleas of specialist independent dis-
               tributors, it was eventually assigned to United Artists under 
               Rank's overall deal with that company, and released by it in 
               May 1945. The running time listed in the Motion Picture Herald 
               review of 24 March 1945 was 148 minutes and the title is 
               given as Colonel Blimp. Four years later, Blimp resurfaced 
               in the trade press with a report that Rank had initiated 
               action by the Federal Trade Commission to restrain UA from 
               showing a version of 91 minutes, cut from the 'original' of 
               143 minutes. + The outcome, it was stressed, was academic, 
               since the film 'had been out of circulation for over a year'. 
               By the early 50s, it appears that either the US version had 
               become the only one available in Britain, or that the film 
               had been further shortened - possibly in order to fit into a 
               double-bill. Running times of 140 and 120 minutes have been 
               quoted by various sources. All of these shortened versions 
               (if there was more than one) seem to have had the Prologue 
               removed, so that the action started in 1902 and moved forward 
               to the Turkish Bath in 1942-43.  This, at any rate, was the 
               version that I first saw in a nitrate print in 1971, but 
               unfortunately did not time.

               In 1976, the BFI Deposit Collection was handed over to the 
               National Film Archive, which took the opportunity to 
               'cannibalize' the three prints it now held, making a nitrate 
               viewing copy of some 160 minutes. This was first seen publicly 
               in 1978 at the FIAF Congress in Brighton and at the National 
               Film Theatre's Powell-Pressburger retrospective in October-
               November 1978. A first phase of restoration then started, 
               with support from the BBC, to make a printable safety 
               negative, based on the original Technicolor separations. The 
               result was unsatisfactory technically, but capable of being 
               enhanced electronically for a TV transmission on 11 October 
               1980, billed as allowing the film to be 'seen tonight on 
               television for the first time in its full original version'.

               Work continued at the NFA, supervised by Paul de Burgh and 
               with help from the Rank Film Laboratories and a grant from 
               the Sainsbury Charitable Trust, which resulted in a new safety 
               negative. This provided the basis of a reissue of the film 
               by BFI Distribution in 1985, after a Gala Screening at the 
               Screen on the Hill on 18 July, attended by Powell and 
               Pressburger. It has been used as the basis for annotating 
               the original script.

               * Rank's original distributor, General, still existed in the 
               US; and The Archers seem also to have been active in trying 
               to place their film. Hence this 'holding' designation.

               + Motion Picture Herald, 15 January 1949; Kinematograph 
               Weekly, 13 January 1949, p. 22. Geoffrey Macnab refers to 
               these reports, but claims in his J. Arthur Rank and the 
               British Film Industry (London, 1933) that the film was reduced 
               'to only a little over a tidy hour', thereby adding further 
               confusion to an already tangled tale.

                                        SEQUENCE 1

               A series of shots, composed and edited, to produce the maximum 
               effect of speed, efficiency and modern equipment. Locations 
               must be chosen roughly between Staines and Elstree, along 
               line of the Green Belt and the arterial roads, giving 
               composite impression of the approaches to West London. Some 
               air-shots will be necessary.  The intention is to create, as 
               simply as possible, an impression of the mechanization and 
               resources of the modern British Army.

               EXTERIORS: DESPATCH RIDERS

               A small army of motorcycle despatch riders, several hundred 
               of them, are tearing along an arterial road at full speed.

               At a roundabout they divide into three columns, one going 
               right, another left, the third straight on. We follow the 
               third column.

               The by-pass ends at a T-road. The column divides again, one 
               column west, the other east. 'We follow the eastbound column.  
               The eastbound column divides again, one half going south. We 
               plunge, with the southbound column, into a country road. The 
               riders are now about twenty in number.

               The column dashes through a water-splash and divides again 
               into two parties. We follow the smaller group of riders.  
               Three are left as they race into a picturesque village 
               occupied by troops. One of the riders stops at a strong-point 
               where an eager officer grabs the message.  

               Now there are only two riders.  

               At a farm, one of the two riders turns off the lane through 
               a farmyard.

               [[We follow him, through the farm and down a bumpy cart-track 
               which leads to the headquarters in the field of 'B' Company, 
               the 2nd Battalion, the 4th Brigade, the 2nd Division of the 
               6th Army Corps.]] 

                                        SEQUENCE 2

                               Exteriors: H.Q. 'B' Company

               'B' Company is a rifle company. [[Headquarters is a field, 
               well situated strategically but damnably uncomfortable.  The 
               Company has been dug in by itself for four days.  It is in 
               touch by runner with Battalion H.Q.

               It is a fine evening now but for the past three days it has 
               rained, which has made enthusiasm difficult, and living, 
               cooking and sleeping impossible.  They have done all the 
               proper things, camouflaged their vehicles, and taken advantage 
               of the surrounding terrain, what there is of it.]] 

               [They have made their headquarters in a farm.]  The men are 
               half-starved, trained to a hair, ready for. anything and 
               bored stiff. That goes for the officers too.

               COMMANDING OFFICER'S BILLET

               LIEUTENANT 'SPUD' WILSON is shaving under difficulties [[and 
               a hawthorn hedge]] [in a barn].  He is a very large, tough, 
               rude, young officer. But he has a manner. He gets away with 
               murder.  He is popular with his Company and stands well with 
               his Colonel.  

               He has one creed in war: he believes in winning the FIRST 
               BATTLE.

               The DESPATCH RIDER rides up and [[starts to open his wallet]] 
               [is toppled from his motorcycle by a rope stretched across 
               the yard].

               ['STUFFY' GRAVES, a platoon commander, is keeping watch from

               Inside the barn, SPUD is still shaving. The SERGEANT-MAJOR 
               enters.

               SERGEANT-MAJOR puts fingers in mouth and gives special

               SPUD continues shaving, communing with himself.

               A GIRL in A.T.S. uniform is telephoning from a public box 
               near the entrance.

               SPUD'S commando sweeps up.  This is the final objective.  
               They attack in strength, the trucks emptying like magic, the 
               Bren Carriers facing three ways along the street, their crews 
               ready.  SPUD is the first out.  His quick eye spots the girl.

               SPUD without waiting to see his orders carried out, runs up 
               the steps of the Turkish Baths, where he stops and turns.

               scantily draped in towels, sit or recline at ease.]] 

               ATTENDANT'S DESK (OUTSIDE)

               SPUD and his men crowd the entrance. The ATTENDANT stares 
               horrified at them. The telephone bell is ringing like mad. 

                                     SPUD
                              (To ATTENDANT)

                              (He moves off.)
                         And answer that dam' phone!

               WIZARD takes the receiver off, grimly covering the ATTENDANT 
               with his tommy-gun meanwhile. Over the receiver we hear an 
               excited GIRL'S voice. WIZARD plays up.

                                     WIZARD
                         [Yes, miss.] Warn who, miss?  General 
                         Wynne-Candy, miss?  Can't do that, 
                         miss.
                              (Holds receiver away 
                              from his ear as girl's 
                              voice screams.)

               [[GIRL'S VOICE What do you mean?  I must speak to him!

               Camera tracks swiftly into close shot of receiver.  We can 
               hear plainly the Girl's voice and sound of hammering.

                                     GIRL'S VOICE

                         dare you!

                              the door of the booth)

                         war too.]] [And so are you.]
                              (Listens, then suddenly 
                              gets impatient.)
                         You're NUTS! The War's over!
                              (He rings off.)

               THE HOTTEST ROOM

               SPUD and his merry men invade the room, guns and other weapons 
               in their hands.

               They look strange and alarming in their battledress in the 
               incongruous setting.  

               SPUD peers through the steam.  [[He sees his Final Objective,

               The commando at once invests the whole room. Some cover the 
               waking figures. Others guard the approaches, their backs to 
               the scene. Still others are seen through the glass partition 
               rounding up the attendants and some other bathers.

                                     [SPUD

                              (To ATTENDANT)
                         Where's General Wynne-Candy?

                         You heard. Now show me the way. Come 
                         on.]

               SPUD, almost frightened now that he has reached his objective, 
               advances with an obvious effort on the Final Objective: MAJOR-
               GENERAL SIR CLIVE WYNNE-CANDY, v.c., D.S.O. 

               GENERAL WYNNE-CANDY is so like Colonel Blimp in appearance 
               that he must certainly have been the model who inspired David 
               Low. 

               He IS Blimp.

               Here is the great face, the sweeping moustaches, the ivory-
               domed head, the noble belly, even the little crease on his 
               fat chest. 

               In BLACK AND WHITE, Colonel Blimp is an awe-inspiring figure; 
               but in TECHNICOLOR!  No wonder SPUD hesitates. He is sweating, 
               not only from the heat.

               He stands a moment looking down at his sleeping prize. Then 
               he gently taps him on the shoulder.

                                     SPUD
                              ([To himself)

               Do you remember in Kipling's 'The White Seal', when the 
               diminutive Kotick by his barking, wakes Sea-Catch, the great 
               Walrus; how Sea-Catch starts awake, banging his neighbour 
               with his flipper and coughing and spluttering 'Eh? How? What?'

               All round them the other members of the staff are waking. 
               They see the armed, clothed figures. The GENERAL stares at 
               SPUD as if he were a dangerous lunatic. He looks around for 
               help.

                         I say, Suggie, this is a devil of a

                         But you damned young idiot, war starts 
                         at midnight! Haven't you been told!

                         And may I ask [[again]], on-what-
                         authority?

               The GENERAL looks around him and takes in the whole outrageous 
               scene suddenly. He nearly has a fit. He gasps:

               SPUD reckless now, his uniform a sponge, dashes a bucketful 
               of sweat off his face and sweeps on.

               His parade voice has so much authority that he actually brings

                         am Major-General Wynne-Candy. These 
                         other gentlemen have all seen service, 
                         distinguished service, with the

                         Well, all I can say is, sir, that 
                         when Napoleon said an army marches 
                         on its stomach [he must have been

                              (He is very angry, 
                              but he sees that the 
                              grand manner won't 
                              help him)
                         You're an extremely impudent young 
                         officer, sir. But let me tell you 
                         that in forty years [time] you'll be 
                         an old gentleman, too. And if your 
                         belly keeps pace with your head, 
                         you'll have a bigger one than any of 
                         us!

                         Maybe I shall. In forty years. But I 
                         [[I'll bet that you were the same in 
                         the last war.  And forty years ago!]] 
                         [I Doubt it. And I doubt if I'll 
                         have time to grow a moustache like 
                         yours, sir. But at least in 1983 
                         I'll be able to say I was a fellow 
                         of enterprise.]

               This is too much for the GENERAL who drops forty years of 
               authority and experience like a cloak and goes for his 
               impudent young antagonist with his bare fists.

               SPUD, devastated by heat, emotion and a wild desire to laugh, 
               weakly defends himself, moving hastily backwards before the 
               windmill attack of the GENERAL, who all the time is bellowing:

                                     GENERAL
                         I'll punch your head for that, young 
                         fellow! I'll punch your head!  Put 
                         'em up! D'you hear me?
                              (Grunt.)
                         Think you can say what you like to 
                         an old 'un, do you? [[I'll teach 
                         you!]]  Do you know how many wars — 
                         I've been in?  I was fighting for my 
                         country when your father was still 
                         in bum-freezers!
                              (Smack — thud—grunt.)
                         [[You set up to teach me what a 
                         soldier should or shouldn't do - 
                              (he gets a bit tangled 
                              up from the foam 
                              like Venus)

                         Gangster!]]

               At this point, SPUD'S retreating feet find air beneath them 
               and he falls backwards into the plunge-bath. Without 
               hesitation the GENERAL leaps in on top of him. The battle 
               continues in three and a half feet of cold water.

               Clouds of steam ascend, hiding the combatants as it thickens. 
               Through the gathering clouds the voice of the GENERAL 
               continues to boom, but as the clouds thicken, the voice gets 
               fainter.

                                     GENERAL
                              (Booming through the 
                              steam)
                         [[What do you know about me?]]  You 
                         laugh at my big belly, but you don't 
                         know how I got it - !  You laugh at 
                         my moustache, but you don't know why 
                         I grew it! -
                              (His voice grows 
                              fainter.)
                         How do you know what sort of man I 
                         was - when I was as young as you are 
                         — forty years ago — forty years ago—

               Blimp's — beg pardon — CANDY'S last words sound hollow and 
               faint. Already they are no longer real. The words hang in 
               the air, like the thick clouds of steam.

               [[For a moment there is silence.

               Then a full orchestra plays the opening chords of Brünhilde's 
               great and difficult soprano solo in Wagner's 'Walkury [sic].

               The music breaks off.

               Then a very real, ordinary young man's voice starts to sing 
               (very flat) the Aria, from somewhere nearby.

               This voice belongs to 2ND LIEUTENANT HOPWELL.

               Then another young man's voice with a familiar note in it 
               joins in the Aria from the plunge-bath.]] The clouds of steam

                         stallion]]!  Since when are you in 
                         London?

               By this time they have met.

                                     HOPPY
                         Got back yesterday. Sick leave. I've 
                         been chasing you all over town.
                              (Awkwardly.)
                         I say, old chap, I was awfully sorry 
                         to hear about your leg -

               He has been avoiding looking down but now he does. His 
               sympathetic expression changes.

                                     HOPPY
                         Jumping Jehosaphat! They're both 
                         there!

                                     CLIVE
                         What the hell did you think I was 
                         standing on?

                                     HOPPY
                         I thought you had a wooden leg.

                                     CLIVE
                         Why should I have a wooden leg?

                                     HOPPY
                         They told me in Bloemfontein that 
                         they cut off your left leg.

               They both examine attentively Clive's left leg.  CLIVE shakes 
               his head.

                                     CLIVE
                         Can't have, old boy. I'd have known 
                         about it.

               They both roar with laughter.

               [[The two young men lower their voices but soon forget again.

                         I got it in the shoulder.

                              (Peers)
                         Can't see a thing.  Now whose leg do 
                         you suppose they really cut off?

                         Oh, I see.  So it is.

                         Not much. Where are you putting up?

               They have both raised their voices again.

                         Fact! But I found out this morning 
                         that they sport a phonograph. So I 
                         said to Horsey - by the way, the old 
                         boy's putting on weight - 'Sorry, 
                         old man, thanks for the doss down 
                         but phonographs are barred!'

               He sweeps once more into the Mignon Aria, at the top of his 
               lungs which are good. CLIVE joins in enthusiastically. His 
               lungs are also not negligible.

               The inner doors open and the two friends come marching out 
               in the same tempo, very pleased with themselves, in colourful 
               smart uniforms, their great-coats over their shoulders, their 
               caps and swords at a dashing angle, looking as if they had 
               just stepped out of a bandbox. They adjust their gloves.

               [[PORTER]] [DOORMAN] runs out and we hear him blow his

               Meanwhile sound of clop-clopping, 'Whoa!'etc.  The [[PORTER]] 
               [DOORMAN] reappears, shivering and blowing on his hands to

               But before they can move, the inner doors are flung open 
               again and out storms the PERIOD BLIMP, in the uniform of a 
               Major-General, which at that time was even more gorgeous 
               than at present. The two young officers click heels, and 
               give him a terrific salute. He acknowledges and is about to 
               pass when he recognizes them. They remain stiffly at 
               attention. He has them on toast.

                         Well, sir, Mr Conan Doyle is 
                         collecting material about our campaign 
                         in South Africa to counter German 
                         propaganda. The Times printed an 
                         interview with me about seven weeks 
                         ago -

                         That's bad. Good rule to keep out of 
                         the papers. Still The Times is a bit 
                         different.

                         Yes, sir. I mentioned in the interview 
                         the name of a place called Jordaan 
                         Siding. I spent seven months there.  
                         Now this girl writes from Berlin 
                         that the worst stories of all are 
                         being put about by a fellow called 
                         Kaunitz who says he saw with his own 
                         eyes British soldiers kill two hundred 
                         and fifty women and children at 
                         Jordaan Siding in order to save 
                         feeding them!

                         little [[skunk]] [rat]!  He was spying 
                         for us, he was spying for the Boers, 
                         he made South Africa too hot for 
                         himself and skipped. Both sides would 
                         have shot him if they'd caught him.

                         do?

                         sir. Why shouldn't I go to Berlin

                         done. This isn't Army business, it's 
                         Embassy. Leave politics to the 
                         politicians. You wouldn't like a

               and a rug round his legs. He is, of course, in mufti. The 
               time is 9.30 in the morning.

               CLIVE is writing picture postcards. Several are lying on the 
               table beside him. He is whistling: 'You are my Honey, 
               Honeysuckle, I am the Bee!' 

               INSERT: postcard. CLIVE writes: 'Dear Hoppy, Have outspanned 
               at the Kaiserhof Hotel. Berlin is bigger than I thought.

               Nothing happens.

               CLIVE frowns and hunts on the table. He picks up a slip of 
               paper on which he has written the most necessary phrases for 
               everyday use during his stay in Germany. The German is written 
               phonetically with the English translation opposite.

               LITTLE SALON

               It is a pleasant little room, decorated and furnished in 
               rococo style.

               EDITH HUNTER is [[seated composedly on a sofa in the centre 
               of the room]] [pacing impatiently].  She is very neat; and 
               well, though not extravagantly dressed. She is what was known 
               in 1902 as a 'New Woman': which meant that she intended to 
               live her own life and knew her own mind. She has character 
               to back it up; and brains. The sedateness of her appearance 
               is mitigated by little crystals of snow, melting and 
               glistening in her hair and on her furs.

               STAIRCASE

               At the bottom of the main staircase, outside the Little Salon. 
               [[CLIVE comes down at breakneck speed, halts abruptly at the 
               foot of the stairs, glances sharply but with secret approval 
               at his manly figure in a full-length mirror and continues 
               with equal impetuosity into the Little Salon.]]

                         Surely not both, Mr Candy.

                            Interior: British Embassy, Berlin

               OFFICE OF 'BABY-FACE' FITZROY

               It is the smallest and most inconvenient office in the 
               Embassy. It is a very odd shape. It connects by a multitude 
               of doors with the offices of other Secretaries, still minor, 
               but far more important than MR FITZROY.

               This statement of fact and opinion is, needless to say, not 
               shared by MR FITZROY, who has a very great idea of his own 
               importance.

               As the scene opens, he is seated at his desk, impeccably and 
               officially dressed (above-desk) in black coat, starched collar 
               and cuffs, grey tie, etc. from which we can deduce the neat 
               striped trousers and patent leather shoes (below desk. 

               A pile of letters lies before him which he is hastily reading 
               and then stamping with the Embassy stamp (but not, of course, 
               signing or initialling. He contrives to make the simple action 
               look portentous and when he pauses and scrutinizes one of 
               the letters and puts it aside for consideration, one feels 
               that the unfortunate Subject involved has practically 
               forfeited his national status.

               CLIVE sits, patiently waiting, opposite BABY-FACE, who had 
               been a very junior contemporary of his at Harrow. He is 
               impressed, as was intended, by his host's show of importance. 
               The door to the waiting room opens and YENNING, an old clerk, 
               puts his head in, evidently not for the first time.

                                     YENNING
                              (Pleading)
                         Mr Fitzroy!

                                     BABY-FACE
                         All right, Yenning, I'm coming...

               YENNING fades away. CLIVE stands up.

                                     CLIVE
                         Look here, old man, I'll come back 
                         another time. I didn't know you were 
                         as busy as all this.

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Always on Tuesdays...

                                     CLIVE
                         When can we get together?  

                                     BABY-FACE
                         What about Saturday? We could have a 
                         drink or something...

                                     CLIVE
                         I'll be on my way back by then. Well, 
                         Baby-Face,
                              (MR FITZROY winces)
                         Pity you're so busy. I wanted to 
                         have a talk with you.

               He looks round as a Secretary crosses from one door to the 
               other, stepping over MR FITZROY en route.

                                     CLIVE
                         You must feel like Baden-Powell in

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Oh! You mean that crowd in the waiting 
                         room? 

                                     VENNING:

                                     BABY-FACE:

                              (To CLIVE)
                         Well, they'll have to wait that's 
                         all. I'll tell Yenning to take you 
                         out the back way so that you won't 
                         be bothered by them.

                                     CLIVE
                         They don't bother me. They prove I 
                         was right to come here.

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Why? Are you working for Thomas Cook?  

                                     CLIVE
                         What the deuce d'you mean?  

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Well, they all want to go back to 
                         England, they? How do I know what 
                         you mean?

                         If you'll listen I'll tell you. They 
                         want to go back because they've lost 
                         their jobs. Why have they lost their 
                         jobs? Because of anti-British 
                         propaganda. Because of liars like 
                         Kaunitz.

                         yourself. It's his lies that are 
                         filling your waiting room. Don't you 
                         know that he's accusing us of 
                         murdering women and children in South 
                         Africa?

                                     BABY-FACE
                         What do you mean 'us'? I haven't 
                         murdered anybody.

                         else does in this place that calls 
                         itself an Embassy!

                         to you!

               CLIVE has not been through a Subaltern's War for nothing.  

               Bray-Face shoots to his feet as if he'd been kicked from 
               below, revealing that, below desk, he is wearing a pair of 
               heavy tweed knickerbockers. CLIVE stares then deliberately 
               walks round and inspects him. It is further revealed that he 
               has thick stockings and heavy boots with skates attached to 
               them, which makes it difficult to be impressive when standing.

                                     CLIVE
                         Ye Gods and Little Fishes! Skates! 
                         What is this! The British Embassy or 
                         a Winter Sports' Club?  

                                     BABY-FACE
                              (Caught bending)
                         I was just trying them on when you 
                         came in. (He tries to regain his 
                         important tone.) I have to go skating 
                         with the daughter of the Second 
                         Secretary. I'm late already...

               He sits down again. But CANDY is still furious. He leans 
               over the desk to within a few inches of the startled young 
               man's face.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Ferociously)

                         And the silly neck of the silly Second 
                         Secretary's silly pudding-faced 
                         daughter! And now I'm going to find 
                         Kaunitz and pull his nose for him - 
                         HARD! Goodbye.

               CLIVE whirls round and the slam of the door almost rocks the 
               building. BABY-FACE stares after CLIVE, stunned. VENNING re-
               opens the door.

                         He's mad! Absolutely mad!  We were 
                         at Harrow together, Yenning. All 
                         this nonsense about Kaunitz.

               Suddenly his expression changes. He has just realized the 
               implications of CLIVE'S remarks about Kaunitz.

                                     BABY-FACE
                         KAUNITZ! But I say! He must be 
                         stopped!  He's going to make an awful 
                         scandal! Just now, too! Stop him, 
                         Yenning! Stop him!

               BABY-FACE rushes forward himself, forgetting his skates, 
               which promptly catch in the carpet and trip him up. He falls.

                                     BABY-FACE

               OFFICE OF SECOND SECRETARY

               The time is about half an hour later. The SECOND SECRETARY 
               is a diplomat de carriere, cool, reasonable, about forty-
               five.

               BABY-FACE FITZROY sits to one side. CLIVE faces the SECRETARY 
               who is making a note.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (Looking up and laying 
                              down his quill pen)
                         Yes - my dear Candy - I think I 
                         understand. It's not a bad idea. 
                         Unfortunately there are complications.

                                     CLIVE
                         It seemed clear enough to me.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (Smiles)
                         Yet there are one or two things you 
                         may not know.
                              (It is a charming 
                              smile.)
                         First there is the 'Alldeutscher 
                         Verband'.

                                     CLIVE
                         Yes, sir. I've heard about them.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Indeed? From whom?

                                     CLIVE
                         From a young lady who lost her job 
                         because of anti-British propaganda.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Ah, yes, I see. Then she will have 
                         told you that the whole propaganda 
                         against us is party-politics - a 
                         slogan for the banner of this 
                         Alldeutscher Verband. The German 
                         Government has officially condemned 
                         it.

                                     CLIVE
                         But how about all these mass-meetings, 
                         sir - in Cologne and Dresden - how 
                         do we know how the German People --

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Let us leave the German People out 
                         of it, shall we? In Germany there is 
                         only one man who counts: the Kaiser; 
                         and the Kaiser desires only the 
                         friendliest relations with England.

                                     CLIVE
                         He's got a funny way of showing it.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         I assure you it is true. But let me 
                         come to my second point. I propose 
                         to make you a present of a piece of 
                         highly confidential information.
                              (Impressively.)
                         The Prince of Wales is coming to 
                         Berlin.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Surprised)
                         No! When?  

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         On the 27th of January. I repeat 
                         this is strictly in confidence.  The 
                         official reason is the Kaiser's 
                         birthday party. But it has been 
                         arranged that both His Royal Highness 
                         and His Imperial Majesty will make a 
                         speech; and their speeches will put 
                         the seal on the agreements of 
                         friendship between the two countries.
                              (He smiles winningly.)
                         So you see what harm your solitary 
                         exploit might do, Candy. Not that I 
                         don't admire your pluck - especially, 
                         may I say, as a soldier on active 
                         service, who certainly needs a permit 
                         to cross the Channel...

                                     CLIVE
                         I am not on active service, sir. I 
                         am on sick leave.

                                     2ND SECRETARY:
                         Oh, we know all about you. There are 
                         not many Candys with the V.C. 

               CLIVE is silent.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         You see, a soldier who has won the 
                         V.C. is not an ordinary soldier. His 
                         views, like his deeds, receive more 
                         attention than those of the average 
                         man. So, should trouble result from 
                         your actions here, it would be more 
                         than average trouble.
                              (Pause.)
                         Well?  

                                     CLIVE
                              (Slowly)
                         Of course, sir, if His Royal Highness 
                         the Prince of Wales is... 

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Exactly. That is the correct attitude 
                         and, after all, you could hardly 
                         have known about it, could you?
                              (He has looked at his 
                              watch.)
                         You have missed the afternoon train. 
                         Pity. It's an excellent train. But 
                         you can take it tomorrow.
                              (To BABY-FACE)
                         Why don't you show Candy the town 
                         tonight, Fitzroy ? You could take 
                         him to the Opera!

                                     CLIVE
                         Thank you, sir, but I have an 
                         appointment tonight.

               MR FITZROY'S face is an undiplomatic mirror. He is extremely 
               relieved at CLIVE'S refusal. The SECOND SECRETARY stands, 
               bringing the two young men to their feet. He shakes hands 
               with CLIVE.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         It was an idea of yours, Candy.  
                         Don't run away with the idea that I 
                         think it isn't. But, next time, do 
                         ask the advice of some older man.
                              (He smiles.)
                         Experientia docet, you know. Take 
                         advantage of the experience of age. 
                         Goodbye, my boy! A pleasant crossing!

                                     CLIVE
                         Thank you, sir.

               He starts for the door.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (To BABY-FACE)
                         Show Candy the way out, Fitzroy, and 
                         then come back. I want a word with 
                         you.

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CLIVE
                         Thank you I know the way out.

               He is gone, without a glance at BABY-FACE.

                                       SEQUENCE 30

                            Interior: British Embassy, Berlin

               WAITING ROOM

               CLIVE comes out of the SECOND SECRETARY'S office, shutting 
               the door behind him. He pauses at what he sees.

               There are three rows of benches, all crowded with people, 
               mostly professional classes, business men, schoolteachers, 
               governesses, people who have been compelled to give up their 
               jobs because of the anti-British feeling.  They are a lost-
               looking ' bunch of people. They look up as CLIVE comes out.

               After a second's pause, CLIVE crosses the room. He gives the 
               impression that he does not dare to look these people in the 
               face. Fade out.]]

                                    SEQUENCES 31 & 32

                                Cafe Hohenzollern, Berlin

               It is a typical big Berlin musical cafe.  It has two floors, 
               an upper and a lower, connected by a wide shallow staircase 
               covered with red carpet. The time is about 9 p.m. and people 
               are crowding in through the wide doors from the wintry street 
               outside. It is still snowing. The Porter outside carries a 
               huge, open umbrella.

               The Patrons of the Cafe are mostly from the middle class and 
               upwards. Students are there in their coloured caps (each 
               student organization has a different cap), artists, officers, 
               one or two parties of society people, ordinary townspeople 
               with their families — all sorts. They eat and drink; glasses 
               of hot punch and mugs of beer are the favourites and there 
               is a great bustle everywhere.

               On the upper floor, where the landing makes a big bay, there 
               is an orchestra. Their standard of playing is quite high. 
               The orchestra consists of a piano, a drum, a double-bass, a 
               cello, a flute, a clarinet, two violas and four violins; 
               and, of course, a conductor. But the more unusual feature is 
               a wooden frame on a pole into which numbers can be inserted.  
               Before each new piece, its number is put up, corresponding 
               with the number in a little booklet placed on every table 
               giving the name of the piece and its composer. There is 
               consequently a great turning-over of leaves at every table 
               when a new number is put up, for the cafe habitues are music-
               lovers; in fact many of the regulars know their favourite 
               numbers by heart and applaud as soon as they are put up.

               At the start of the scene, a number is just finishing. There 
               is some applause. Then a new number is hoisted and we see 
               the various reactions of the crowded, noisy colourful cafe. 
               At a table for two, close to the orchestra on the upper floor, 
               sit EDITH and CLIVE.They are drinking punch and eating cakes. 
               The cake-holder is like a little silver tower with different 
               cakes on each landing and is to be seen on many of the tables.

               EDITH is looking up the number in her book.

                                     EDITH
                         [[773]] [93]...It is a song-all the 
                         rage just now: 'Die Mull...', The 
                         Mill Went Round and Round', Mr Candy.

               The orchestra starts to play. EDITH hums it.  CLIVE, who is 
               looking very uncomfortable, takes the plunge.

                                     CLIVE
                         Miss Hunter. I am afraid I have met 
                         you here under false pretences.

                                     EDITH
                         Indeed! Why?  

                                     CLIVE
                         There are — political complications.  
                         [The Prince of Wales is coming to 
                         Berlin. He's invited to the Kaiser's 
                         birthday party. A goodwill visit, 
                         all that sort of thing, you know.

                                     EDITH
                         Yes, I know. It is in the papers.

                                     CLIVE
                         You see, Miss Hunter, I know a chap 
                         in our Embassy here. We were at school 
                         together. His name's Fitzroy, only 
                         we used to call him 'Baby-Face'.

                                     EDITH
                         But how are the Prince of Wales and 
                         your friend Baby-Face connected?  

                                     CLIVE
                         Well, you see, he nearly had a fit 
                         when he knew why I'd come - Baby-
                         Face, I mean. He dragged me in to 
                         see the First Secretary, and he nearly 
                         had a fit too. A possible scandal, 
                         you know.

                                     EDITH
                         Are you coming to a point, Mr Candy?  

                                     CLIVE
                         The point is that] I had to promise 
                         to do nothing. [And I went bail for 
                         you too.] Apparently it's a matter 
                         for careful diplomacy. You can see 
                         what they mean.

                                     EDITH
                              (Flatly)
                         Yes, of course.

                                     CLIVE
                         I know nothing about politics.[[I

               Below we see a big round table, reserved for its usual

               just arriving.  CLIVE stares.

                         Still - good manners are important.

                         say good manners cost us Magerfontein, 
                         Stormberg and Colenso, six thousand 
                         men killed, twenty thousand wounded 
                         and two years of war when, with a 
                         little commonsense and bad manners, 
                         there would have been no war at all!

               At the table below there are by now several German officers 
               present as well as the students and a couple of ordinary 
               citizens. A waiter has just brought beer. The students have 
               a special gesture, making silly-looking circles with their 
               beer-mugs before drinking.

               CLIVE continues his conversation with this astonishing young 
               woman who thinks marriage and good manners over-rated.

               She stops short, seeing CLIVE is not listening. His eyes are 
               on the entrance-door.

               At the entrance, KAUNITZ has just come in and is shaking and 
               brushing the snow from his clothes. He crosses the crowded 
               cafe to the big table immediately below CLIVE and EDITH, 
               where he is noisily greeted by name and introduced to two of 
               the officers who are newcomers.

               CLIVE is still astonished at seeing KAUNITZ actually here in

               EDITH sits again. CLIVE is rapidly turning the pages of the 
               music catalogue. He finds what he wants.

               A waiter comes. Meanwhile, EDITH reaches for the catalogue 
               and looks in it.

                         Please! Ask him!  I'll explain later. 
                         [[One-three-nine]] [One-four-one].  
                         And please ask for the bill.

               The orchestra is just finishing a piece. The waiter comes up 
               to the conductor and asks him to play [[139]] [141], 
               indicating where the request comes from.

               The leader looks across, smiles and bows.

               We see CLIVE and EDITH across the cafe. They smile.  Below, 
               two waiters bring a fresh load of beer to the big table. 
               Some people around are looking up at the orchestra.  They 
               clap as they see the new number. Others consult their books.  

               Up at the orchestra, we see [[139]] [141] going up on the 
               pole.  At the table above, CLIVE explains to EDITH, while 
               watching KAUNITZ.

                                     CLIVE
                         Kaunitz was a prisoner in our 
                         blockhouse for seven weeks. This was 
                         the only record we had on our 
                         phonograph. I want to see if he 
                         remembers it.

               At this moment the orchestra plunges into the opening chords 
               of the Aria.  KAUNITZ, sitting with his friends, looks round 
               with a frown.

               CLIVE, above, is delighted.

                                     CLIVE
                         Touched him on the raw all right!

               KAUNITZ beckons his waiter.

                                     EDITH
                              (Excited)

               CLIVE is already waving a twenty-mark note to attract his 
               waiter.

                                     CLIVE
                         Herr Ober!
                              (To EDITH)
                         Is it done to bribe the orchestra?

                                     EDITH
                              (Her blood is up too)
                         Not with money! [Beer!]
                              (To the waiter)
                         Bier fur das Orchester!

               KAUNITZ, with vigorous gestures, has told his waiter to tell 
               the conductor to change the piece of music. The waiter goes 
               across and up the stairs to deliver the message.

                                     EDITH
                              (Thrilled)
                         He's going to stop it.

               They watch in tense excitement.

               KAUNITZ sits frowning impatiently. His friends kid him a 
               little.

               Above, the waiter crosses from the top of the stairs to the 
               orchestra, who are in the middle of the piece. The 
               waiterwhispers in the ear of the conductor, who looks puzzled.  
               The waiter persists and points down to KAUNITZ'S table.

               The conductor looks down at KAUNITZ.

               Below, from his angle, we see KAUNITZ and his friends.  The 
               conductor smiles at these important customers, nods and turns 
               to his orchestra. He prepares to bring the piece to an abrupt 
               close.

               KAUNITZ smiles, gratified.

               EDITH takes this to heart. CLIVE is watching for his own 
               waiter.

                                     EDITH
                         Oh dear! He's going to stop!  

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Cheer up!]] [Round one to Kaunitz.] 
                         Reinforcements are coming!

               From CLIVE'S angle, we see his waiter, carrying a huge tray 
               piled with a dozen beer-mugs, bearing down on the beaming 
               orchestra. The waiter evidently explains to the conductor 
               that the beer has come from the [[Wagner]] [Mignon] fans. 
               The conductor, who was skilfully about to bring the piece to 
               a close, turns and bows in the direction of CLIVE and EDITH, 
               turns back and changing tempo continues to conduct the 
               orchestra in the Aria with greater fire than ever.

               KAUNITZ, who has turned his back on the orchestra, satisfied 
               that he has buried Titania, chokes in his beer, and starts 
               coughing. His friends pat him on the back. He turns round, 
               furious, and glares up at the orchestra.

               His waiter arrives back and explains with apologies what 
               happened. Some of his friends start to share his annoyance.  
               They all look up at the table over their heads.

               CLIVE and EDITH, who have been looking down, hastily draw 
               back just in time.  

               CLIVE and EDITH exchange grins, safely out of sight above.

                                     [[EDITH
                         Now what?]] 

               CLIVE shrugs, but there is a gleam in his eye that would 
               alarm the First Secretary.

               KAUNITZ, with a face of thunder, pushes back his chair, 
               crosses the cafe and runs up the stairs to stop it himself. 

               His table applaud him vigorously.)

                                     [CLIVE
                         He's coming up!

                         Let's go, Mr Candy.

                                     CLIVE

                                     EDITH
                         I hope he doesn't see you!

                                     CLIVE
                              (Alas for diplomacy!)
                         I hope he does!

               (KAUNITZ arrives at the top of the stairs. He pauses, throws 
               a glance towards his impudent rivals, invisible until now, 
               then is about to cross to the orchestra. A chord of memory 
               vibrates. He stops, looks again.

               CLIVE returns his look. KAUNITZ can hardly believe his eyes. 
               Then he comes towards CLIVE, who rises pleasantly and with 
               great nonchalance.)

                                     CLIVE
                         Hullo, Kaunitz!

               KAUNITZ approaches slowly. He has had quite a shock but he 
               controls himself. He makes no attempt at formal greeting and 
               he ignores the girl. He stops at the table and looks at CLIVE 
               with a grin.

               People around sense that something is in the air.

               Down below the friends of KAUNITZ all stand up and step back 
               to see what is going on, which makes other people look up.

                                     KAUNITZ
                         [[Das ist ja gut um wahr zu!  
                              ('This is too good to 
                              be true.']])
                         [Das ist ja eine schöne Uberraschung,

                              surprise, Mr Candy.'])

                                     CLIVE
                         Come on, Kaunitz, you speak English!

                                     KAUNITZ
                         I do. But I prefer German!

               He suddenly steps to the balcony rail and at the full pressure 
               of his lungs addresses the crowded café:

                                     KAUNITZ
                         Meine Damen und Herren!

               The orchestra stops abruptly. There is a commotion as people 
               turn round, jump to their feet or ask each other who the 
               speaker is.

               KAUNITZ, still grinning like a fox, looks down, waiting for 
               silence.

               This is more than EDITH has bargained for. She begins to see 
               the possible dangers.

                                     [[EDITH

                         Bit late now!]]

               He steps over to KAUNITZ. 

                                     CLIVE
                              (Persuasively)
                         Stop it, Kaunitz, I'm with a lady. 

                                     KAUNITZ
                         You should have thought of that before 
                         you started your little joke!  

                                     CLIVE
                              (Taking his arm)
                         Stop it, Kaunitz!  

                                     KAUNITZ
                              (Furiously)
                         Take off your hands!

               He tries to strike down CLIVE'S hand from his arm. But the 
               Englishman's grip at once tightens and the blow only hurts 
               his own hand. This makes him livid with anger. Never ceasing 
               to struggle in CLIVE'S iron grip CLIVE now holds him helpless 
               by both arms he shouts for help.

                                     KAUNITZ
                         Kameraden!

               His friends below, joined by others, are already surging 
               towards the stairs.

                                     SHOUTS
                         Durchlassen!
                              ('Gangway.')
                         Platzmachen.  Zurzück!

               KAUNITZ, still held powerless by CLIVE who, for obvious 
               reasons, is not anxious to let go, is still struggling madly 
               on the verge of a fit.

                                     KAUNITZ
                              (Screaming)
                         Lass mich los, du Schwein!
                              ('Let go, you swine.')
                         Kameraden!  — You English swine! - 
                         You English murderer! -
                              (He spits in CLIVE'S 
                              face.)

               This is too much for CLIVE. He suddenly lets go of KAUNITZ. 
               The man staggers, then recovers.

               CLIVE hits him - once. It is enough. Up till now his actions 
               have been purely defensive but he has been longing to hit 
               KAUNITZ for days. All that longing is behind the punch which 
               knocks KAUNITZ cold. He falls on the table and showers of 
               little cakes descend upon the upturned faces below.

               CLIVE turns to EDITH, who takes his arm and they start to 
               go.

               Four friends of KAUNITZ, panting and indignant, bar their 
               way: an Ulna officer, two students, an ordinary citizen.  
               The latter crosses to KAUNITZ and, with help, get's the 
               unconscious man on to a chair.

                            Interior: British Embassy, Berlin

               CORRIDOR

               Two pairs of jackboots, wonderfully polished, snugly fitting, 
               beautifully in step, marching firmly down the corridor of 
               the Embassy.

               They come to a door, halt, stand rigid.

               A pair of dark trousers and elastic-sided boots, which have 
               evidently preceded the two pairs of jackboots, vanish through 
               the door, preceded by an agitated knock.

               The owners of the jackboots are two very smart officers in 
               the uniform of the 2nd Regiment of Ulans of the Guard. Both 
               are Oberleutnants.

               The owner of the elastic-sided boots reappears. It is VENNING.  
               He leaves the door wide open and motions towards it.

                                     VENNING
                              (In bad German)
                         Bitte sehr!

               Without a word, the two officers march in. 

               VENNING closes the door.

               The two officers click their heels, bow, shake hands.

               The two officers sit.

                         Of course we lost touch a bit since 
                         the War. He's Army, you know.

                                     VON RITTER
                         He is an officer of the British Army?  

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Yes. He's just come back from South 
                         Africa.

                         You have relieved us from great 
                         doubts.

                         I don't quite understand... 

                                     VON RITTER
                         We were worried that your friend 
                         might not be able to give 
                         satisfaction.

                                     BABY-FACE

                                     VON RITTER
                         It is understood that an officer of 
                         the Imperial German Army cannot demand 
                         satisfaction from an opponent who is 
                         not his equal in position and honour. 
                         But since this Clive Candy is a 
                         British officer, he can be challenged.

                         Interior: British Embassy, Berlin

               CORRIDOR

               It is empty except for VENNING ambling down with a dispatch-
               box.

               BABY-FACE shoots out of his office across the corridor into 
               the office opposite. At once he reappears almost dragging 
               MAJOR GOODHEAD, the Military Attache, whom he propels into 
               his own office to meet the two Ulans.

               He himself pounces on VENNING, who is now near at hand. 

                                     BABY-FACE
                         Yenning!  Hurry over to the Kaiserhof!  
                         Bring Mr Clive Candy here at once! 
                         Don't come back without him!  Now 
                         hurry!  

                                     VENNING
                         Ye-yes, Mr Fitzroy.

               BABY-FACE at once turns and vanishes into the office of the 
               THIRD SECRETARY.

               VENNING stands dithering about uncertain what to do with the 
               dispatch-box, finally knocks at a new door, the office of 
               the SECOND SECRETARY, and goes in to deliver it. 

               MR FITZROY and three new gentlemen rush out of the THIRD 
               SECRETARY'S office and cross to the office of the SECOND 
               SECRETARY, They all crowd in.

               A moment later, YENNING shoots out followed by MR FITZROY 
               very annoyed and hectoring. 

                                     BABY-FACE
                         I told you to HURRY, Yenning! Now 
                         don't argue, GO AT ONCE!

               MAJOR GOODHEAD, with a face of thunder, hurtles out of MR 
               FITZROY'S office and up the corridor.

               YENNING really gets under way.

               Behind him the party, reinforced to the number of seven, 
               comes sweeping out of the SECOND SECRETARY'S office and up 
               the corridor to the large and important door of the FIRST 
               SECRETARY. On the way they are overtaken by MAJOR GOODHEAD.  
               All arrive at the door together. There is a pause. The SECOND 
               SECRETARY knocks. Then he and the MILITARY ATTACHÉ go in, 
               beckoning to MR FITZROY, who meekly follows.

               OFFICE OF THE FIRST SECRETARY

               It is a very large and splendid room with a high ceiling. A 
               blazing fire is burning under the elaborate mantelpiece. The 
               two gentlemen and the gallant officer enter. They stop, seeing 
               that the FIRST SECRETARY is engaged with a visitor.  The 
               FIRST SECRETARY is a very wise, very courteous elderly 
               gentleman. His visitor is seated with his back to the door.

                         They are drawing lots, sir, to decide 
                         who is to have the honour of fighting 
                         this gentleman--

                         I see. Have you any suggestions, 
                         Major?

                              (Pacifically)
                         Militarily speaking, Mr Candy has no 
                         option. He cannot fight a duel. He 
                         must run away!

                              (Belligerently)
                         And politically speaking, such an 
                         action would be disastrous. Mr Candy 
                         must fight!

                                     1ST SECRETARY
                         Gentlemen! One moment!  Surely you 
                         are leaving Lieutenant Candy out of 
                         your calculations?

                         I'll fight if necessary, sir.

                         My dear boy, I know that.
                              (Pause)
                         You had better go to your hotel now 
                         and stay there. Oh, and can you get 
                         in touch with Miss - ?

                         Explain to her that it is necessary 
                         to give the impression that your 
                         reason for coming to Berlin was to 
                         see her. You are probably in love 
                         with her, or something of the sort.

                         My dear Lieutenant, you have caused 
                         enough trouble already. Do what I 
                         ask. Meanwhile I and these gentlemen 
                         will discuss the best way to get you

               OFFICE OF SECOND SECRETARY

               INSERT: a thin brown booklet (usually known as 'The Brown 
               Codex'). It is the famous:

                                      GUSTAV RISTOW

               The time is later on, the afternoon of the same day. It is a 
               Conference of Seconds. Those of the Englishman are: The SECOND 
               SECRETARY and the MILITARY ATTACHE. Those of the German: VON 
               RITTER and VON REUMANN. (The latter, who is a Rittmeister 
               (Captain), is an older officer in the same Regiment of Ulans, 
               he speaks English even better than von Ritter.) All four are 
               seated around a big round table. It is a very serious 
               Conference.  The Englishmen are naturally ill-at-ease; the 
               Germans are not, having done this sort of thing before: VON 
               REUMANN is lofty, VON RITTER is affable.

               [[The Codex lies on the polished table.  VON RITTER pushes 
               it across to MAJOR GOODHEAD.]] 

                                     VON RITTER
                              ([To VON REUMANN)
                         May I have the Codex, Herr 
                         Rittmeister?] This is our famous 
                         'Brown Codex', Major Goodhead, the 
                         'Code of Honour' observed by all 
                         duellists. We thought you might not 
                         be familiar with it.

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (Drily)
                         Thank you. I shall study it with 
                         attention.  

                                     VON RITTER
                         We have permission to offer for the 
                         site of the duel the gymnasium at 
                         the barracks of our Regiment.

               The MAJOR and the SECRETARY exchange glances. The SECRETARY 
               nods firmly.

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (Gloomily)
                         We agree.

                                     VON RITTER
                         We are now in a position to announce 
                         the name of our fellow officer, who 
                         will fight Lieutenant Candy: 
                         Oberleutnant Theodor Kretschmar-

                         May I make a note of that?

                         Here is his card.
                              (He passes it across.)

                                     VON RITTER
                         Have you gentlemen any suggestions 
                         regarding choice of Leader for the 
                         Duel?

                              (Still gloomily)
                         We suggest the Military Attaché [[of]] 
                         [to] the Swedish [[Embassy]] 
                         [legation].

               The two Germans confer solemnly in a whisper.

                                     VON REUMANN
                         We agree. His name?

                                     VON RITTER
                         Regarding sabres, we shall, of course, 
                         supply a number to choose from.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         With your permission, we shall supply 
                         a number as well.

                                     VON RITTER
                         Certainly. The choice of sabres will 
                         be determined by lot...             

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (Nods)
                         Good.

               VON REUMANN reaches for the 'Brown Codex' and, opening it at 
               para. 13 7, points to it.

                                     VON REUMANN
                         You know, of course, that the sabre 
                         must not exceed the maximum weight 
                         of 60 Dekagrammes!

               VON REUMANN passes the book to the SECOND SECRETARY, who 
               reads it gravely.

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (Reading also)
                         We shall make a note of it.
                              (He does so.)

                                     VON RITTER
                         You will bring your own doctor, of 
                         course -

               The two Englishmen nod

                                     VON RITTER
                         And we shall bring ours.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (Swallowing slightly)
                         We agree.

               His imagination is beginning to work.

                                     VON RITTER
                         Do you prefer to strip the upper 
                         part of the body of the combatants 
                         or do you prefer them in shirt 
                         sleeves?

               SECOND SECRETARY swallows again.

                              (He points to passage 
                              in book.)
                         I see here that Paragraph 133 says: 
                         'It is advisable a few hours previous 
                         to the duel, to take a bath!' 

                                     VON RITTER
                         Only the principals. Not the seconds.
                              (He laughs.)

               The others smile, even the sensitive SECRETARY. The ice is 
               slightly broken.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         It is a very strange sensation to be 
                         preparing a duel between two people 
                         who have never even seen each other.

                                     VON RITTER
                              (Carelessly)
                         It happens sometimes. Marriages also!
                              (He laughs again.)
                         By the way, has your man ever fought 
                         a duel?  

                                     GOODHEAD
                         No. Has yours?

               VON RITTER stands, exchanging a glance with VON REUMANN.

                                     VON RITTER
                         Between ourselves, Theo does not 
                         really approve of duels.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (Hopefully)
                         Then gentlemen - is this fight really 
                         necessary?

                                     VON RITTER
                              (Very seriously and 
                              choosing his words)
                         Sir. There are in a soldier's life 
                         moments when his personal feelings 
                         do not count. Oberleutnant Kretschmar-
                         Schuldorff knows his duty very well.

               All the gentlemen stand up.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         We have not agreed the time, 
                         gentlemen.

                                     VON REUMANN

                         Get it over early.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         (Nods)
                         [We agree] Seven o'clock.

                                     VON RITTER
                         It would be advisable to meet half 
                         an hour earlier.

                         At 6.30 a.m. in the gymnasium, at 
                         the barracks of the Second Ulans.

               [[Far away a town clock starts to strike the hour.

               VON RITTER picks up the 'Brown Codex'.

                                     VON RITTER
                         The 'Code of Honour' prescribes that 
                         the watches of the Seconds should be 
                         synchronized by the town clock.  It 
                         is now three o'clock precisely!

               All four gentlemen set their watches.]] 

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                       SEQUENCE 38

                             Interior: The Gymnasium, Berlin

               [[The clock, high on the wall, stands at 6.50.  Outside the 
               glass roof it is still black night.]] 

               The CAMERA MOVES to show the vast, bare, brilliantly-lit 
               place. The limits of the combat area have been marked out on 
               the floor by the Seconds: VON REUMANN is still supervising 
               it with  COLONEL BORG.

               CLIVE CANDY enters, accompanied by the FIRST SECRETARY. Their 
               clothes are powdered with snow. CLIVE'S two Seconds cross at 
               once to meet him and his companion. -

                                     [2ND SECRETARY
                         Here comes our man.]

                                     GOODHEAD
                         Morning!
                              (To CLIVE only)
                         Slept well?  

                                     CLIVE
                              (Cheerfully)
                         Very.

                                     1ST SECRETARY
                         He was still sleeping when I called 
                         for him at the hotel.

                                     CLIVE
                         They forgot to wake me.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Your nerves are all right, my boy.

               While talking, they cross to their end of the hall, where 
               there are two chairs and a bench. A similar arrangement exists 
               at the opposite end for the Germans. The English DOCTOR is 
               waiting and is introduced. He is an elderly man, an ex-Army 
               surgeon, Lancashire-born.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         Dr Crowther - [[Lieutenant]] [Mr] 
                         Candy.

                                     CROWTHER
                         How d'ye do?

               Shakes hands and shifts hand to CLIVE'S wrist without relaxing 
               his hold. He feels the pulse, meanwhile scrutinizing CLIVE, 
               who smiles back good-humouredly.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Surveying his party 
                              with humour)
                         Why wasn't I allowed any breakfast?

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (Producing the 'Codex')
                         Because the book says not.

                                     CLIVE
                         It would.

               The DOCTOR shuts his watch with a snap, restores it to his 
               pocket and grunts:

                                     CROWTHER
                         All right! You'll do.

               He starts to take off his jacket.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         I hope you have read it?

                                     CLIVE
                         Miss Hunter read it. She says it's a 
                         joke good enough for Punch!
                              (Looks around.)
                         Where is Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff?  

                                     GOODHEAD
                         He hasn't shown up yet.

                                     1ST SECRETARY
                         I congratulate you on your 
                         pronunciation of his name.

                                     CLIVE
                         I learnt it by heart. So that when 
                         my grandchildren ask: 'Grandpa! Have 
                         you ever cut anybody's ear off?' I 
                         shall be able to answer: 'Yes - Theo 
                         Kretschmar-Schuldorff's.' Nobody 
                         could invent a name like that. Who's 
                         this?

               A tall OFFICER in a different uniform approaches.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         Colonel Borg, the Swedish Military 
                         Attaché. He is going to lead the 
                         combat.
                              (Introduces.)
                         Colonel Borg - [[Lieutenant]] [Mr] 
                         Candy.

                                     COL. BORG
                              (Bows)
                         I must of course use German 
                         expressions. I shall say 'Los!'  for 
                         starting and 'Halt' for stop. Can 
                         you memorize these two words?  

                                     CLIVE
                         I'll try, sir. Anyway at the beginning 
                         I'll be pretty sure you mean 'Start'!  
                         And, during the combat you're not 
                         likely to say 'Start' again!

                                     COL. BORG
                              (Stolidly)
                         That is true. Excuse me.
                              (He bows again and 
                              goes.)

               [[CLIVE looks up at the clock on the wall.]] 

                                     CLIVE
                         Seven o'clock.
                              (Looks towards 
                              entrance.)
                         Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff will 
                         forfeit his entrance fee if he isn't--
                              (He breaks off.)

               At the entrance, at the other end of the hall, three German 
               officers of the ^nd Ulans have entered.  The officer slightly 
               in the lead of the other two is THEO KRETSCHMAR-SCHULDORFF. 
               He walks swiftly, looking neither to the right nor to the 
               left, followed closely by the others, the only noise their 
               boots on the hard floor of the gymnasium and the swish of 
               their heavy greatcoats, flecked with snow.  They reach the 
               'German' end of the hall and are greeted by the little group 
               of their people.

               THEO salutes smartly, clicking his heels each time before he 
               shakes hands with his fellow officers VON RITTER and VON 
               REUMANN with the German Army Surgeon and with COLONEL BORG. 
               He looks a tall, ominous figure in his slightly fantastic 
               uniform, he has, as yet, no personality beyond being the 
               chosen representative of eighty-two serious-minded indignant 
               Ulan officers.

               Formalities done, THEO at once starts to remove greatcoat, 
               jacket and trappings. As yet we only see these actions through 
               CLIVE'S eyes, at the full length of the hall. No clear 
               conversation can be heard, only a distant sharp mutter, 
               sounding hollow in the rafters of the empty gymnasium. COLONEL 
               BORG leaves the German group and crosses towards the British.

               CLIVE is in his shirtsleeves. He looks wistfully at the other 
               group.

                                     CLIVE
                         I wish I'd brought my uniform!  

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (Reacts, then remarks)
                         How are you with a sabre? 

                                     CLIVE
                         [Oh, I don't know.] I know which end 
                         to hold.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         We drew lots for each weapon.

                                     CLIVE
                         I hope mine is a nice light one.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         All sabres weigh the same.

               COLONEL BORG joins them.

                                     COL. BORG
                         Excuse me, please. [Would you undo 
                         your shirt?]

               He unbuttons CLIVE'S shirt and peers inside. CLIVE reacts. 

                                     COL. BORG
                         Right!
                              (He points to Clive's 
                              right arm.)
                         Do you want to roll up your sleeve 
                         or rip it off?  

                                     CLIVE
                         What's better?

                                     COL. BORG
                         I am not permitted to give advice.

                                     CLIVE
                         I think I'll rip it.

                                     COL. BORG
                              (Nods)
                         It is definitely better. 

                                     CLIVE
                         Doctor! Your scissors, please!

               The DOCTOR steps forward with a fearsome pair of scissors. 
               He cuts the sleeve, then rips it off. While he is doing this, 
               CLIVE speaks to him.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Low voice)
                         What did he hope to find there?
                              (He means inside his 
                              shirt.)

                                     CROWTHER
                              (Same tone)
                         Protective bandages.

               CLIVE nods.

                                     COL. BORG
                              (To CLIVE)
                         Now you, alone, will come with me, 
                         please.

                                     1ST SECRETARY
                         Good luck.

               The SECOND SECRETARY and MAJOR GOODHEAD keep their fingers 
               crossed. CLIVE and COLONEL BORG march solemnly together until 
               he stops CLIVE with a gesture in his half of the chalked 
               arena. The German is already standing in his place.  The two 
               sabres are on a bench, equidistant from both combatants.

               Both men secretly eye each other with curiosity.  The German 
               is a tall broad-shouldered man, about 3 o, with a fine 
               thoughtful face.

               The Ritual of German Duelling now follows: First the Protocol.

               COLONEL BORG takes a sheet of paper from his pocket and, 
               standing between the opponents, reads aloud, first German, 
               then English.

                                     COL. BORG
                              (Reads)
                         Ich werde jetzt das Protokol vorlesen - 
                         I shall read now the Protocol.
                              (Pause)
                         A)  Sie dürfen den Kampf nur auf das 
                         Commando 'Los' beginnen  You will 
                         start only at the command 'Los!'
                              (Pause)
                         B) Sie müssen den Kampf auf das von 
                         wem immer gegeben Commando 'Halt' 
                         unterbrechen - You must stop the 
                         combat if you hear the command 'Halt' 
                         whoever may say it.
                              (Pause)
                         C)  Sobald Sie sich verwundet fühlen, 
                         Sie haben den Kampf sofort 
                         einzustellen und durch zuriickspringen 
                         die Distanz anzunehmen, auch wenn 
                         nicht 'Halt' commandiert wird - If 
                         you feel to be wounded you must stop 
                         the combat and by leaping back you 
                         must regain position at the original 
                         distance even if no 'Halt' has been 
                         commanded.
                              (Pause)
                         D) Es ist verboten, die Waffe des 
                         Gegners mit der freien Hand zu 
                         ergreifen - It is forbidden to seize 
                         the weapon of the opponent with the 
                         bare hand.

               The COLONEL looks interrogatively at both opponents. They 
               nod. They have understood. The COLONEL raises his voice.

                                     COL. BORG
                         Secundanten, bitte! 

               They step forward, VON RITTER crosses to the bench by the 
               wall, takes the sabres, offers one to THEO, hands the other 
               to MAJOR GOODHEAD, who offers it to CLIVE.   

               The four Seconds take up position. Each combatant has one 
               Second on either side, remaining at such a distance that 
               they do not interfere with the free movements of the 
               principals.

               All Seconds have sabres too.

               COLONEL BORG sees that all is correct, then addresses the 
               principals.

                                     COL. BORG
                         Fechtstellung einnehmen! - 'Into 
                         fighting-position, please!

               In the 'Fighting-Position'the sabres are extended towards 
               the opponent at the full stretch of the arm.

               COLONEL BORG steps forward and, standing between them, takes 
               hold of the two sharp points, bringing them together until 
               they are a little less then two feet apart.

               For a moment, he holds them thus with the tips of his fingers. 
               Then suddenly he steps back, snatching his hands from the 
               blades, and gives the command to start.

                                     COL. BORG
                         Los!

               The fight starts. They are both strong swordsmen.

               The CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE AWAY, further and further, HIGHER 
               and HIGHER. 

               We see CLIVE'S two Seconds. They stand with the points of 
               their two sabres towards the floor, ready to intervene and 
               strike up the fighters' blades if necessary.

               The clash of steel and the stamp and quick movements of the 
               fighters' feet go steadily on.

               Then we see the German Seconds, also standing motionless and 
               watchful, with downward pointing swords.

               The movement of the CAMERA QUICKENS. It SWEEPS AWAY from the 
               fighters and HIGH ABOVE them. They and their Seconds are 
               small figures in the middle of the vast brightly-lit hall. 
               The clash of steel becomes fainter.

               Above the hissing gas-chandeliers the cross-trees of the 
               roof are in semi-darkness.

               Then - without a break - the CAMERA slips through the huge 
               windows and we are out in the street.

                                       SEQUENCE 39

                                Exterior: Barracks, Berlin

               Snow is softly falling between the camera and the brightly-
               lit windows of the gymnasium. There are streaks of light in 
               the sky but the street is still dark except where the lamps 
               throw pools of light.

               The CAMERA has TRAVELLED BACK so far now that WE SEE the 
               walls of the barracks and the sentry-box at the gates. 

               In the foreground appears a waiting carriage, the horses and 
               coachmen wrapped in their blankets, both half asleep. But 
               the two occupants of the carriage are not asleep: they are 
               EDITH HUNTER and BABY-FACE FITZROY. Both are watching the 
               lighted windows across the street, muffled in fur coats and 
               heavy robes. It is a hard winter, the winter of Berlin. 

               In the carriage they watch the distant windows in silence. 

               EDITH is very anxious.

                                     EDITH
                              (Low voice)
                         They must have started by now.

                                     BABY-FACE
                              (Tactfully)
                         You never know. I heard of one chap 
                         whose nerve broke - absolutely went 
                         all to pieces -

                                     EDITH:
                              (Same tone)
                         Poor fellow.

                                     BABY-FACE:
                              (Running on)
                         He was in such a funk - this chap -
                         that he couldn't even lift his arm. 
                         His Seconds tried to lift it for him 
                         but as soon as they let go down it 
                         dropped like a railroad signal. Rum!
                              (He ruminates for a 
                              moment: EDITH glances 
                              at him with distaste.)
                         I say, I hope our chap doesn't get 
                         killed, it'll create an awful stink 
                         if he does.

                                     EDITH
                              (Very angry)
                         Mr Fitzroy! [I think] you are the 
                         most odious man I have ever met!  
                         And if anything happens to him I - I 
                         will blow up [[the]] [your] Embassy!  

                                     BABY-FACE
                         I say!
                              (Stares.)
                         [[D'you know, I really believe you 
                         would!]] Are you [[an anarachist 
                         (sic)] [a suffragette] Miss Hunter?

                                     EDITH
                         [[Not yet!]] [Never mind!] But if 
                         anything should happen to Mr Candy -

                                     BABY-FACE
                              (Comprehending)
                         Oh! You mean Suggie!  I was talking 
                         about the German fellow. Why, Sugar 
                         Candy won the Shield at school two 
                         years running. Nothing can happen to 
                         him. Old Suggie's never -
                              (He suddenly stops 
                              speaking.)

               EDITH is not listening. She is staring towards the gate of 
               the barracks, horrorstruck.

                                     EDITH:
                              (Almost inaudibly)
                         ... Oh! [Look]...

               MR FITZROY turns sharply and follows her glance. 

               The gate has just been opened. An ambulance-wagon comes 
               rumbling out of the barracks, turns sharply and is off down 
               the street, the Army driver lashing the two horses to make 
               them gallop.

               Through the frozen snow on the sides of the wagon we see the 
               great Red Crosses.

               The lights go out in the gymnasium.

               The duel is over.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       SEQUENCE 40

                                  Interior: Nursing Home

               The Nursing Home, a very exclusive and expensive one, almost 
               a private hotel, is on the Stolpchensee, one of the lovely 
               inland lakes in the forests to the south-west of the city, 
               covered with skaters in winter and with boats and bathers in 
               summer.

               THE VESTIBULE

               The vestibule, which is large and handsome, has long windows 
               looking out over the forest and lake. As this is only one 
               day after the duel, the landscape is covered with snow.

               On Visitors' Day the vestibule is crowded with people going 
               and coming, chatting to convalescents and each other. But 
               today is not Visitors' Day and there is only one visitor 
               visible: EDITH HUNTER. She wears the same outfit as in the 
               carriage. Several nurses are bustling about. EDITH is 
               preoccupied but no longer violently anxious as she was in 
               the carriage. 

               From the corridor at one side, MAJOR GOODHEAD and the SECOND 
               SECRETARY appear and come towards her, their faces relieved.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         You can go in now, Miss Hunter.

                                     EDITH
                         How is he?

                                     GOODHEAD
                         The doctor says six to eight weeks, 
                         not more.

                                     EDITH
                         I'm so glad.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         Permission has been granted for you 
                         to stay here in the building.

                                     EDITH
                              (Surprised)
                         Oh, but I am not staying in Germany, 
                         [[Major]] [Colonel] Goodhead. I go 
                         home tomorrow. I have already 
                         telegraphed my father.

                                     GOODHEAD
                              (To SECOND SECRETARY)
                         Haven't you told her?  

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (Embarrassed)
                         ... No...

               EDITH turns slowly and looks with large eyes at the SECRETARY.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         Now you must be sensible, Miss Hunter. 
                         We are very fortunate that everything 
                         has [[turned out as it has]] [gone 
                         off so well]. Do you want to spoil 
                         everything?  The duel was generally 
                         supposed to be about you. What would 
                         people think if you left him now, 
                         wounded and alone in a Nursing Home?  
                         [Naturally] I thought that you 
                         understood all this, otherwise why 
                         have you come here?

                                     EDITH
                         To say goodbye to Mr Candy.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                              (With fatherly patience)
                         Go in now, Miss Hunter. By the way, 
                         don't bother about the bill.  They 
                         have orders to send it to the Embassy. 
                         Good morning.

                                     GOODHEAD
                         Good morning, Miss Hunter.

                                     EDITH
                              (Rather blankly)
                         Good morning.
                              (To herself)
                         Well! (They go off.

               She goes down the corridor to CLIVE'S room.

                                       SEQUENCE 41

                                  Interior: Nursing Home

               CLIVE'S ROOM

               CLIVE is in bed, propped up with pillows. His head is so ban-
               daged that only his nose and eyes are visible.

               NURSE KONIG is putting logs into the big stove.

               EDITH knocks at the door and enters.

                                     [NURSE K
                         Bitte.] 

               For the fraction of a second, she is considerably startled 
               by sight of CLIVE.  Then she recovers and addresses the nurse.

                                     EDITH
                         Guten Tag, Fraulein.

               NURSE KONIG speaks English fluently and incessantly.

                                     NURSE K
                              (Brightly)
                         Good afternoon, miss, you are Miss 
                         Hunter, are you not?  My name is 
                         Erna Konig and I speak really 
                         excellent English.

               (This is true but her English has the excellence of a gleaming 
               set of false teeth.)

                                     EDITH
                         Oh, that's splendid.
                              (Looks at CLIVE.  His 
                              eyes smile and he 
                              waves.  She smiles. 
                              To NURSE)
                         How is he?
                              (In low voice)

                                     NURSE K
                              (In loud cheery voice)
                         He cannot hear or speak. It will be 
                         difficult for a few days until we 
                         remove the bandage. He has a fine 
                         cut, the upper lip is almost severed.  
                         Really it is almost 10 centimetres 
                         in length, a knife could not have 
                         done it better. Do let me take your 
                         coat, Miss Hunter!

                                     EDITH
                              (As she takes off 
                              coat)
                         Is he in pain?  

                                     NURSE K
                         Yes. Certainly. He is a lucky man 
                         that there are no glass splinters in 
                         the wound.

                                     EDITH
                         Glass splinters? Oh! Yes.

                                     NURSE K
                         It is a common accident in our winter.

                                     EDITH
                              (Playing for time)
                         It must be.

                                     NURSE K
                         The snow freezes on the boot, the 
                         warm room melts the ice, the little 
                         piece of slippery ice lies in wait 
                         for the hurrying foot and - PFAFF!

               EDITH nods, breathless.

                         But to fall right through the glass 
                         window of the British Ambassador. 
                         Ah! That is not so common!

                                     EDITH
                              (She now has all the 
                              dope)
                         No. Indeed.

                                     NURSE K
                         And would you believe, there is 
                         another accident in the other wing!  
                         An officer! He has cut himself to 
                         the forehead. Twelve stitches!  

                                     EDITH
                         It is quite a coincidence.

                                     NURSE K
                         I go now to tell the Head Nurse that 
                         you have arrived. I am ordered to 
                         prepare your room.  You are staying 
                         here, don't you?

                                     EDITH
                         Yes, Nurse Konig, I do.

                                     NURSE K
                         If you talk to him, please to shout.
                              (She goes but turns 
                              at the door, beams 
                              reassuringly.)
                         I come back.

               EDITH turns and looks at CLIVE. His eyes are smiling. EDITH 
               crosses and smiles down at him. He looks extremely funny, 
               with his bandaged head as big as a football. She bends close 
               to him.

                                     EDITH
                              (Shouts)

                         awful] mess!
                              ([(Repeats loudly.)
                         Awful mess.]

               CLIVE nods. He agrees.

                                     EDITH
                         [[And you have]] [You've] got me 
                         into a [[nice]] mess too!

               CLIVE nods again.

                                     EDITH
                         [I forgive you.] Do you want me to 
                         write to your people in England?

               CLIVE nods.

                                     EDITH
                         [[To your]] parents?

               CLIVE shakes his head.

                                     EDITH
                         Brother - sister? 

               CLIVE shakes his head.

                                     EDITH
                              (Same tone)
                         Fiancee?

               CLIVE, violent shake of head. He points to a pile of personal 
               belongings on the table near the bed. The only thing helpful 
               is a wallet.

                                     EDITH
                         [Oh, you want] Your wallet?

               CLIVE nods. She goes and gets it. He opens it, takes out 
               letter and shows the signature to Edith.

               INSERT: the letter. On this page there are only a few words 
               in a large, sprawling handwriting:

                                          'Your

                                     EDITH (O.S.)
                         [Oh, your Aunt.] What is the address?

               CLIVE'S hand turns back to the first page. This contains the 
               address and the main body of the letter, which is short and 
               to the point: 

               33 Cadogan Place,

               S.W.1 

               January 20th 1902 

               My dear Nephew, You seem to prefer the hospitality of your 
               Club to that of my house. I therefore suggest that in future 
               you send all your peculiar-smelling stuffed animals to your 
               Club as well. 

               P.T.O. 

               EDITH incredulously turns the letter over, unable to believe 
               that this is all. But it is. She can hardly help smiling as 
               she hands it back to CLIVE.

                                     EDITH
                         Your Aunt seems to like short letters. 
                         What shall I [tell her] [[write]]? 
                         The truth?

               CLIVE shakes his head.

                                     EDITH
                         Accident?

               CLIVE nods. 

               INSERT: he takes a snapshot out of the case. It is a very 
               bad one of a South African hunting group with dead animals. 
               One of the group is presumably CLIVE but they all look alike.

                                     EDITH
                              (Nods)

               CLIVE nods.

                         Do you know that Oberleutnant 
                         Kretschmar-Schuldorff is here?

               CLIVE nods.

                                     EDITH
                         He has a [very] bad cut on his 
                         forehead.

               CLIVE by signs indicates he has had eight stitches. How many 
               had the other fellow?

                                     EDITH
                         [He has] Twelve stitches!

               CLIVE, very proud, makes sign of satisfaction. NURSE KONIG 
               comes in with a tray of chocolate and cakes.

                                  Interior: Nursing Home

               THE VESTIBULE

               The bell, announcing the end of visiting hours, is ringing. 
               The vestibule is full of people: groups talking to patients 
               who are able to move or be wheeled about, visitors leaving, 
               visitors who have met other visitors who are acquaintances. 
               It is an expensive and fashionable Nursing Home, with visitors 
               to match. 

               Suddenly there is quite a stir. There is a sound of marching 
               boots. All heads turn towards a corridor which debouches on 
               the left of the hall: a group of officers of the 2nd Regiment 
               of Ulans of the Guard appears. Conscious of their fine 
               appearance and of the sensation they are causing, they cross 
               the hall in a solid body making a good deal of noise.

               A GIRL, in the foreground, near the camera, says:

                                     GIRL
                         Ulanen! [Wunderbar!]

               A new commotion arises from the corridor which debouches on 
               the right of the hall. All heads turn in that direction. A 
               group of officers of a famous English regiment are emerging, 
               also in full regimentals. They are also conscious of the 
               stir they are creating. Their leader, a colonel, has a 
               magnificent bristling moustache. They cross the hall towards 
               the exit. 

               [[The young GIRL is even more excited by the English. She 
               turns excitedly to her escort, a middle-aged 'Berliner'.

                                     GIRL
                         Das sind ja Auslander!
                              ('They are foreigners.')

                              Elizabeth!')

               At the exit, the two parties of officers have arrived at the 
               same time. Each party politely waves the other on. 

                                     [1ST BRITISH OFFICER
                         After you, sir.

                         I think he meant you should go first.

               Finally the difficulty is solved by the respective senior 
               officers who go out together, followed by the others in pairs - 
               one Englishman and one German.

               EDITH, in a deep easy chair close by, has watched this couple 
               with amusement. She now stands up, her finger in her book to 
               keep the place.

               She smiles. EDITH smiles back. She starts to cross the hall 
               towards the corridor on the right.

               NURSE KONIG has collected a number of ash-trays full of cigar-
               butts and pipe-dottels. She does not approve of smoking.

                                     NURSE K
                         I thought nobody can smoke more than 
                         a German officer. Now I see a British 
                         officer can surpass him.

               CLIVE is sitting up, in a chair by the stove. The swathing 
               bandages are off his head, which is now a normal size. He 
               can speak but not move his head. He has a complicated bandage 
               under his nose and fastened to his neck. He has a mirror in 
               front of him and with a pair of toothbrushes, he is trying 
               out the effect of several kinds of moustaches.

                         A German man would shave off his 
                         moustache to show he had a scar!

                         [Erna].

               NURSE KONIG does not mind being teased at all. Her national 
               and native self-esteem is too thick.

               She goes out. EDITH sits down by CLIVE.

               NURSE KONIG returns, bringing a folding card table and 
               twopacks of cards. EDITH looks surprised and turns to CLIVE.

               CLIVE'S ROOM

               The end of a game in progress. It is now night. An oil-lamp 
               shines down on the table. EDITH'S hand sweeps up the last 
               three tricks.

                                     CLIVE (O.S.)
                         You're a good pupil, Edith.

               There are still only the two of them.  EDITH has changed   
               into a dinner-dress. CLIVE has made himself respectable.  On 
               a little table, near, are drinks and glasses. NURSE KONIG 
               hovers, ready to leave.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Totting up figures])

                         That makes £32,000 I owe you. [Toss

               CLIVE tosses coin. It falls on the table. He covers it with 
               his hand. Both their heads come together over it. Very solemn.

                                     CLIVE
                         Well! Which is it?

               EDITH sighs. CLIVE smiles. She smiles back. They have not 
               been so intimate before. Nor so alone.

                              (Smiles approvingly)
                         Good night.

               A knock comes at the door. There are voices.

                                     EDITH
                         Here come our bridge-players.
                              (To NURSE KONIG)
                         [[Please]] [Would you] let them in.

               NURSE KONIG opens the door.

               A tall YOUNG WOMAN comes in, followed by somebody in a 
               wheelchair, pushed by the HEAD NURSE: somebody in the uniform 
               of the Second Ulans.

               CLIVE stares. It is THEO KRETSCHMAR-SCHULDORFF. EDITH has 
               never seen THEO, but of course she recognizes the uniform 
               and guesses at once who it is. A glance at CLIVE'S face 
               confirms her guess.

               The HEAD NURSE is quite innocent of what she has done in 
               bringing these men together.

               Of course THEO and the WOMAN with him know exactly whom they 
               are going to meet: THEO is smiling and the German WOMAN is 
               charming.

               THEO speaks no English, or at least very little. He is very 
               good-looking and about four years older than Clive.  He is 
               an excellent officer of the more thoughtful type. If he were 
               not a soldier he might have been an artist. In one thing he 
               is very much a German: he is thorough in everything he 
               undertakes. He makes many friends and is a good friend 
               himself. It is his own decision which has led to this meeting 
               with his former opponent. The WOMAN is his girl-friend. Their 
               association is not rooted in deep feelings but on a simple 
               physical basis. If one of them were to say one day: T am 
               leaving you because I have fallen in love with somebody,' 
               there would be no tragedy about it. 

               The WOMAN is about thirty. Extremely clever, of the best 
               Berlin society: 'eine moderne Frau' but in a very different 
               way from EDITH, who believes sincerely in the importance of 
               her beliefs. FRAU VON KALTENECK, on the contrary, would be 
               much happier if she did not have to ride or hunt or be a 
               sportswoman. She speaks good English and from the first moment 
               is interested in CLIVE.

               Everybody shakes hands, the two men very heartily.

                              at ten.')

               Both nurses go. There is no awkward pause. On the contrary, 
               they all four feel like children when the grown-ups have at 
               last left them alone. CLIVE turns to THEO very cordially and 
               sincerely.

                                     CLIVE
                         I'm very glad you've come.

               THEO smiles.

                         I promised Theo to make a little 
                         speech. He would like to have made 
                         it himself.

               She looks at THEO.

                         Very much.

                         Theo knows only two English 
                         expressions: 'very much' and 'not 
                         very much'. Right, Theo?

               FADE IN:

               INSERT: the bill of the ERHOLUNGSHEIM AM STOLPCHENSEE 
               ('Nursing Home at Stolpchensee'). The bill is made out in 
               German, and the SECRETARY'S gold-mounted pencil is ticking 
               off the items. The pencil stops at one particular item, 
               underlines it; the pencil is put down and the SECRETARY'S 
               hand presses a push-button on his desk.

               A distant bell rings.  

               The SECOND SECRETARY is trying to be annoyed.

               Outside the sun is shining, it is early spring and the first 
               leaves are appearing on the trees.

               The door opens and BABY-FACE FITZROY puts his head round it.

                         to summon you. Come in.]] [Oh, Baby-
                         Face, I want you a moment.]

               He comes in, revealing that he is beautifully dressed for 
               tennis and even has his racket in his hand. The SECRETARY 
               has looked at the bill.

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         [Yes.] Will you kindly explain [[,Mr 
                         Fitzroy,]] what the deuce this item 
                         means? Forty[[-two]] packs of playing 
                         cards!! It's enough for the Casino 
                         at Monte Carlo!

                                     BABY-FACE
                         [[Yes, sir]] [I know]. I spoke to 
                         Miss Hunter - she says [[the evenings 
                         were so long - ]] there's nothing 
                         [[much]] [else] to do at Stolpchensee 
                         in winter -

                              protest, subsides)
                         Very well.

               He ticks the item and goes on down the list. He looks up and 
               for the first time sees BABY-FACE in his spotless flannels, 
               college scarf and Harrow blazer.

                              (Looks at bill.)
                         These nursing homes are an expensive 
                         business. Is Miss Hunter returning

                                     2ND SECRETARY
                         But not at our expense, I hope?

                                     BABY-FACE
                         [[Oh,]] [Good heavens] no, sir. She 
                         was going anyway [[you remember]].

               CLIVE'S ROOM

               CLIVE and EDITH are packing.

               The window is half open to the garden. The sun is shining, 
               but the stove is still burning for it is cold out of the 
               rays of the sun.  EDITH is very quiet and subdued, noticeably 
               so to anyone but CLIVE, who is whistling noisily. His 
               moustache is coming on nicely although it does not yet hide 
               the scar. Each time he comes within range of the mirror, 
               CLIVE takes an approving look at the new moustache.  

               EDITH is just packing some handkerchiefs when CLIVE stops 
               her and takes them.

                         Don't be so sure. We've only got 
                         half an hour if we are going to call 
                         at the Embassy first. I can manage 
                         here. Come on, stop mooning about!

                         I say, old girl, what's up?

               She turns away. He revolves round her with a bewildered look, 
               peers in her face.

               She looks back at him. She is crying.

               CLIVE is frightfully taken aback and quite helpless.

                                     CLIVE
                         Edith! I say - Edith! What's the 
                         matter? It's not because I didn't 
                         call for you yesterday, is it? You 
                         know — Frau von Kalteneck left last 
                         night for the South.

               The door opens and somebody does come in: NURSE KONIG.  She 
               has an armful of books.  EDITH quickly turns her back.

                              (She has gone.)

               CLIVE looks after her with a frown for a moment. Then his 
               face clears. Girls are strange and anyway there will be lots 
               of time to find out what's wrong. He looks ruefully at the 
               books, which are all German editions.

               THEO appears at the window. During the first part of the 
               scene CLIVE is writing his name in the books.

                         Then we go up. Come on, Theo!

               They start for the door. Stop with the same idea. Look at 
               each other, turn, pick up bottles and glasses and hurry out.

               EDITH'S ROOM

               EDITH looks like a young woman waitingto have her mind made 
               up for her. She is not packing.

                                     [CLIVE (O.S.)
                         Edith!

                         Come in.]

               The door flies open and she starts round as THEO and CLIVE 
               invade the room, beaming and carrying bottles and glasses. 

               One glance at their faces shows her that the ice has been 
               broken.

                                     CLIVE
                         Edith, my child! I feel like a proud 
                         father! 

                                     EDITH
                              (Rather faintly)
                         Do you, Clive?  Why? 

                                     CLIVE
                         I have to give you away, don't I? 

                                     EDITH
                         How did you find out? 

                                     CLIVE
                         Theo told me in fluent Double Dutch.

                                     THEO
                              (Proudly)
                         I told.
                              (To EDITH)
                         Das einzige Wott ich konnte nicht 
                         finden war 'fiancee'.

               They all dissolve in laughter.  CLIVE hands round drinks.

                                     CLIVE
                         A toast! This to the happiness of my 
                         fiancee who was never my fiancee and 
                         of the man who tried to kill me before 
                         he was introduced to me.  Prosit!

               They all drink.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Puts down glass)
                         May I kiss the bride?

                                     THEO
                         Why ask? I have [did] not ask!

               EDITH looks at CLIVE. He steps swiftly forward and takes her 
               in his arms for the first and last time.

               They kiss each other. It is an important moment. It is a 
               brotherly and sisterly kiss; but for a fraction of a second 
               both close their eyes.

               When CLIVE'S eyes are open his whole expression has changed. 
               Suddenly he has realized the truth.

                                     EDITH
                              (Low voice)
                         Goodbye, Clive.

                                     CLIVE
                         Goodbye, Edith - old girl. I hope 
                         we'll meet again sometime -

                         I'm sure we shall -

               CLIVE turns to THEO and takes his hand. He still holds 
               EDITH'S. He is just a little drunk.

                                     CLIVE
                         Now look here, you son of a gun! You 
                         won't understand a word of what I'm 
                         going to say - but I came to Berlin 
                         to find a rat and found two of the 
                         grandest people I ever met. [[I'm a

                         you Prussian stiff-neck, this girl 
                         in trust; and if you don't take care 
                         of her I'll raise the whole of England 
                         against you! The Navy will steam up 
                         your stinking Stolpchensee!  I shall 
                         lead the Army down Unter den Linden!

               CLIVE stops, stares, finishes his drink and pours out another 
               one for himself and THEO.

               THEO has an inkling of how the land lies. He looks gaily and 
               tenderly at them both before he speaks.

                              actors.)

               CLIVE, at last, responds.

                                Interior: 33 Cadogan Place

               HALL

               A brisk tattoo with the front door knocker is bringing PEBBLE 
               to the door with dignified haste. PEBBLE is the Head 
               Parlourmaid of Lady Margaret Hamilton's exclusively female 
               establishment.

               PEBBLE opens the door on the chain.

               CLIVE is outside.

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Good evening]] [Hello], Pebble!

                         Master Clive!

               She half closes the door, slips the chain and opens it wide.  
               CLIVE steps in. They talk in low tones as she closes the 
               door and takes his things.

                                     PEBBLE
                         Your Aunt is asleep.

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Never mind, Pebble. Don't wake 
                         her.]] [All right, don't disturb 
                         her.] I didn't feel like going to 
                         the Club tonight.

                                     PEBBLE:
                         You're not sick, Master Clive?

                                     CLIVE
                         I say, Pebble, how did you feel when 
                         you buried Mr Pebble?

                                     PEBBLE
                         It wasn't so bad at the time, Master 
                         Clive, there was so much to do. It 
                         was after that it got bad, if you 
                         understand me.
                              (CLIVE nods gloomily.)
                         I hope you haven't come from a 
                         burying, sir.

                                     CLIVE
                         No. From the theatre. But it was the 
                         same thing, in a way.

                                     PEBBLE
                         Was it a sad play?  

                                     CLIVE
                         On the contrary. It was a musical 
                         play. Is the bed in my Den made up?

                                     PEBBLE
                         No, sir, but it won't take a minute 
                         if you don't mind sleeping in 
                         blankets. There isn't time to air 
                         the sheets. Lady Margaret has made 
                         some changes, Master Clive, you'll 
                         see when —

                                     AUNT M. (O.S.)
                         Pebble! What is going on there?

               [[CLIVE signs to PEBBLE not to give him away.

                         Nothing, Lady Margaret.

                                     AUNT M.
                         You're a liar, Pebble!

               LADY MARGARET HAMILTON appears on the landing, carrying a 
               small brass oil-lamp. She is in her night attire.  She is as 
               brusque in conversation as in letter-writing.  She sees CLIVE.

                                     AUNT M.
                         Clive!  How dare you come waking up 
                         the whole neighbourhood at this hour 
                         of the night. Go to your club!

               CLIVE smiles and comes running up the stairs to her.

                                     CLIVE
                         All right. I'm going.

               He scoops his aunt up in his arms before she realizes his 
               intention. PEBBLE passes up the stairs smiling.

                                     AUNT M.
                         Did you hear me, nephew? Go to your 
                         club!

                                     CLIVE
                         Very well. Let's go!

               He starts down stairs at a great rate, carrying her as if 
               she were a feather.

                                     AUNT M.
                              (Highly enjoying it)
                         Put me down, you fool!  

                                     CLIVE
                         And I can stay?

                                     AUNT M.
                         I suppose so, since there's no man 
                         here to throw you out.

               CLIVE at once runs upstairs and puts his aunt down on the 
               landing again.

                                     CLIVE
                         How are you, Aunt Margaret?

                         You may give me a kiss.

               She offers her cheek. He gives her a big hug.

               She is not displeased. She examines him.]

               CLIVE'S DEN

               It contains all the personal belongings which he really 
               cherishes.  It's a sportsman's room. He is a keen fisherman 
               and there is a gun-cupboard in one corner. There are a number 
               of athletic cups and shields.

               Prominent on the wall are half a dozen or so heads of animals 
               which Clive has shot in South Africa. 

               CLIVE and AUNT MARGARET enter the Den.

                         Certainly. A very suitable match. He

                         Now [[look here]] [listen], Clive. I 
                         have eighteen rooms here, a bone-
                         idle staff eating their heads off, 
                         and when you come home from South 
                         Africa, you go straight to your Club.

                                     CLIVE
                         I know. It's awful.

                                     AUNT M.
                         [[I had the walls cleared for your 
                         heads. Now,]] I want you to remember: 
                         wherever you go - whatever you do — 
                         you've [always] got a home here! And - 
                         whatever you shoot — there's [always] 
                         room here for them. Look how much 
                         room there is!

               CLIVE looks around the big cosy room. He looks gratefully at 
               his aunt [[and puts his arm round her shoulders]].

               Both of them look up at the heads on the wall.

               [Clive casts a growing shadow on the wall.]

               We see the heads, each with its plate, bearing the date and 
               place where the late owner came face to face with the British 
               acquisitive instinct.

               Music starts to play.  The walls become covered with trophies 
               from all parts of the British Empire: Trophies: Rhinoceros, 
               Onyx, Lion, Tiger, Indian Elephant, Sambhur, Tarpon, Mahseer, 
               Crocodile; Places: British East Africa, Sudan, Rhodesia, 
               Mysore, Upper Burma, United Provinces, St Helena, Kashmir, 
               Ganges Delta; 

               Dates: 1903, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1912,1914.  After 1914 
               the wall is blank.

               The camera shows the bare wall, then swings to show a new 
               trophy. A German spiked helmet, covered in khaki cloth, of 
               the type used in the Great War.

               The inevitable plate says simply: 'HUN.  FLANDERS, 1918.

                                   THE KHAKI SEQUENCES

               The principal reason up to this point for making the picture 
               in colour is because colour is more successful in evoking i 
               period which, although some time ago, is still fresh in the 
               memories of many people. We can claim, of course, the pink 
               >odies of the General's Staff in the Turkish Baths and the 
               General's Red Tabs, but these, however attractive, are 
               decorations. Sights, sounds, but above all, colours, make up 
               the memories of a generation: more so in the case of the 
               period with which we have dealt. 1902 was the commencement 
               of the Edwardian era, full of charm, prosperity, spaciousness 
               and leisure, to which it seemed there could never be an end. 
               Our next use of colour is in the first part of the 1918—1919 
               Sequence which we call for convenience, the 'Khaki Sequence'. 
               After four years of senseless trench warfare, all the colour 
               and variety of Europe and its peoples had been reduced to a 
               uniform dull colour by day and to blackness by night. Khaki 
               was the colour of clothes, faces, official forms, everything: 
               while the battle zone itself had been reduced to a consistency 
               as featureless and as sticky as porridge. By this deliberate 
               elimination of all colours except Khaki, we hope to point 
               this contrast.

                             Exterior: Somewhere in Flanders

               A CROSS-ROAD

               It is dusk. It is not raining but it has been and it will 
               again.  An Army staff car, 1918 vintage, is approaching along 
               the road, once a pleasant avenue, now a dreary, cratered 
               embankment lined with splintered stumps.

               The continuous thunder of heavy guns sounds in the far 
               distance.  The car bumps to a stop at the cross-roads.  On 
               the back seat sits COLONEL (Acting Brigadier} CLIVE CANDY. 
               He is now a man of forty-two, many ribbons on his chest. His 
               moustache is heavy but well cared for, he looks tired but 
               full of energy and devotion to serve his country. He has a 
               map spread out on the seat beside him.

               His driver, [[MULLINS]] [MURDOCH], is also his batman. He is 
               about the GENERAL'S age; out since Mons.

               The landscape, the sky, the car, the men and their mud-
               plastered uniforms are all one pervasive scheme of khaki. 
               The only Spots, of colour are the GENERAL'S Red Tabs. 

                                     MURDOCH
                         This is Dead Cow Cross-roads, sir.

               GENERAL CANDY stands up on the back seat of the car and, 
               through his glasses, examines the landscape.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Mutters)
                         The question is: whether that is the 
                         Church with the double tower, or the 
                         'Estaminet du Pont'?

               Through his powerful glasses we see the featureless mass of 
               rubble at which he is looking. God knows what it is.  MURDOCH 
               sits fatalistically. 

                                     CLIVE
                         Damn it, Murdoch, you're supposed to 
                         know the road!

                                     MURDOCH
                         I know it at night, sir. In the 
                         daytime it looks different.

               CANDY snorts. MURDOCH suddenly sniffs.

                                     CLIVE
                         Eh? Got a scent?  

                                     MURDOCH:
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Sniffs again.)
                         That's our road. I can smell the two 
                         Jerries the Sappers planted.

                                     CLIVE

                         Harkaway, sir!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                  Somewhere in Flanders

               EXTERIOR: ESTAMINET DU PONT

               We see it in the last dull light of the fading day. The rain 
               has started again, a persistent drizzle. All distinguishing 
               features of the Estaminet have either fallen down or fallen 
               in long ago. It is gradually vanishing into the mud and nobody 
               cares. 

               MAJOR VAN ZIJL is waiting outside in the yard as GENERAL 
               CANDY'S car drives up. He has a lady's brown silk umbrella 
               against the rain. He is a tough, lively South African of 
               thirty-four, a veteran of the Boer War.

               He squelches over the duckboards to the car.

                                     VAN ZIJL
                         Glad to see you, sir. I've got another 
                         umbrella for you.

               He produces. The GENERAL accepts it gratefully.

                         You've a marvellous eye for loot,

                                     VAN ZIJL

                         War, sir.

                         Off Jerries—eleven of them-brought 
                         in an hour ago.  Lord knows where 
                         they stole them, they were using 
                         them for camouflage against aircraft.

               While talking they have left the car, crossed the duckboard 
               and gone into the Estaminet.

               BAR

               The room is now the Outer Office of Battalion H.Q. MAJOR VAN 
               ZIJL is in command.

               Can see vaguely that once this was a pleasant little cafe, 
               just as with some filthy old tramp it is not beyond conjecture 
               that he was once a young, attractive man. The contrast is as 
               great.

               The room is crowded. Clerks are working and there is a 
               telephone exchange. Several officers around.

               As GENERAL CANDY and MAJOR VAN ZIJL enter, everybody stands 
               to attention.

                         Good evening.

               He glances round, starts towards the Inner Office, then stops 
               and speaks to VAN ZIJL.

                         there. How about it, Paddy?

                         Not before dark. They're plastering 
                         the road between 17 and 19 with

               The GENERAL has heard VAN ZIJL'S last remark. He goes to the

                         Floating down the river early this 
                         morning. I had a boom across and 
                         netted them like salmon. They had a 
                         hundred pounds of dynamite with 'em.  
                         My guess is they were after the new 
                         pontoon-bridge below St Mangy.

                         They took one of our patrols prisoner 
                         day before yesterday.

                         The Germans know how to make them 
                         talk.

               A little pause follows.  CLIVE is thinking, a fact betrayed 
               by a heavy frown and an occasional 'Hm!'

               He shakes his head as if unwilling to believe something. VAN 
               ZIJL watches him, half affectionately. The slim, dark South 
               African is a contrast to the solid Englishman. He produces a 
               paper from his pocket.

                         [Well if they are,] They're cracking, 
                         my dear chap. It's a sure sign. Nobody 
                         starts to fight foul until he sees 
                         he can't win any other way. I quite 
                         believe Hindenburg, who I hear said 
                         the other day that until now ' Germany 
                         has used her arms with honour -
                              (After a slight pause.)
                         I admit he said nothing about her 
                         legs.

               VAN ZIJL has unfolded the paper, which is printed in German.

                                     [[VAN ZIJL:

               The door opens and the eleven German prisoners march down 
               the passage and into the room under an escort with fixed 
               bayonets. The prisoners have none of the colourful appearance 
               of the Ulans of 1902. All the same they are defiant although 
               not arrogant, as Nazi prisoners would be. They remain grave 
               and serious all through the scene. Outside it is almost dark 
               and the rain has got heavier. The wind has got up. [[When 
               the prisoners come in an Orderly brings in three or four 
               candles stuck in bottles and one oil-lamp with a cracked and 
               smoky chimney and no shade. Another Orderly blacks out the 
               windows. The escort lines the prisoners up against the wall. 
               During all this action, VAN ZIJL reads aloud from the German 
               paper to the GENERAL.

                                     VAN ZIJL
                         It's an appeal from the 'Erster 
                         General Quartier-Meister', from old 
                         man Ludendorff himself, to his loyal 
                         troops. It starts: 'Soldiers, stand 
                         fast or Germany will lie in the dust. 
                         Should the enemy discover that our

                         Our morale is broken, all is lost, 
                         you will have fought and suffered in 
                         vain and the Homeland will hear the 
                         tramp of the invader.' What do you 
                         think of that, sir?

               He is watching the prisoners as he listens.

               CLIVE smiles and walks over to the line of prisoners. They 
               have heard VAN ZIJL reading Ludendorff's appeal but they 
               have given no sign of having understood.]

               GENERAL CANDY walks down the line, examining each prisoner 
               closely. He stops and walks back to a commanding position in 
               front of them.

               MAJOR VAN ZIJL [[comes in.  He]] goes straight up to the 
               English-speaking prisoner who looks at him in a very different 
               way than he looked at GENERAL CANDY.

                         scum. I am not a simple English 
                         gentleman but a simple South African 
                         and I assure you that I have means 
                         to get what I want. (

                         What was the dynamite for? How many 
                         of you got away? What happened to

                         outside, whom you will understand.

               Outside in the yard we hear the tramp of men.  PADDY'S voice 
               shouts: 'Squad! Halt! Order-Arms!' There is a crash as they 
               ground arms on the stones.

               VAN ZIJL sits down at his desk. He looks at the men in front 
               of him, playing with a sjambok which lies on the desk.  He 
               glances at his watch.

                                     VAN ZIJL

                         squad!

               PRIVATE COOPER stares.

               They go out. The two remaining Tommies exchange uneasy looks. 
               So do the prisoners.

               PRISONER makes no answer: he is listening.  A command rings 
               out: 'Fire!'  There is a volley, other ominous sounds. 
               Footsteps are heard leaving the yard and coming back to the 
               kitchen.

               The second three are hustled out.

               The five remaining men are really frightened.

               VAN ZIJL addresses them ruthlessly:

               It is pitch dark. The rain has stopped for a moment. The

               train receding in the distance.

               GENERAL CANDY'S car is waiting for the barriers to open. The 
               light of the headlamps shines on the mud-stained barriers. 
               They rise into the air.

               MURDOCH puts in the clutch but the delay has been fatal. 
               They are stuck in the deep mud. The wheels turn madly but

               The railway station has been shelled so many times there is 
               nothing left of it at all except mounds of shapeless rubble. 
               The rails have always been replaced and that has been all 
               that mattered. Dimly one is conscious of railway lines, ready 
               to trip you up all over the place. Signals, near and distant, 
               are marked by their coloured lamps hanging in the air. But 
               the only trace of any building, let alone organization, is a 
               small hut right on the edge of the network of rails.

               CLIVE stumbles over the rails to the hut.

               His torch flashes on and illuminates a sign: 'R.T.O.'

               He opens the door, showing a glimpse of a smoky interior, 
               and goes in, shutting the door.

                         will do that. It's kind of damp

                         What were those other wars the General 
                         was talking about, Captain?  The 
                         Boer War, the Somy something. I never 
                         heard of them.

                         Those weren't wars. Those were just 
                         summer manoeuvres.]

               ARMSTRONG rings the Convent bell.

               The Cloister connects the Refectory with the Main Entrance. 
               Somebody is using the big knocker to great effect on the 
               outer door. A NUN is hurrying down to answer it. The night 
               has cleared and there is moonlight. The NUN opens the grille 
               and looks out.

                                       SEQUENCE 65

                             Convent of the 'Crown of Thorns'

               REFECTORY

               The NUN and GENERAL CANDY arrive at the door. She opens it 
               and they go in.

               The GENERAL stands astonished at what he sees. Part of the 
               Refectory has been hit by a shell but it is still a noble 
               hall. Long tables run down the huge room and nuns are waiting 
               at table. At the table are sitting nearly a hundred young 
               nurses fresh from England, their bright uniforms and bright 
               faces making the first patch of colour since the Khaki 
               sequence started.

               Most of the nurses look up as the GENERAL enters, then stare 
               at him, muddy and stained, as he stands at the top of the 
               steps. He stares at their eager young faces. He feels suddenly 
               drained of energy. 

               Meanwhile the NUN has fetched two women: the MOTHER SUPERIOR 
               of the Convent and the MATRON who is Transport Officer for 
               the nurses. [[The MATRON is Scottish.]]

                                     MATRON
                         [Good evening,] General, you have 
                         fallen on your feet.

                         trained nurses straight from England 
                         all dying to nurse someone. What's 
                         the trouble?

                         The nun said you had eaten something -

                                     CLIVE
                         She got it wrong - I want to eat. 
                         I'm hungry!  

                                     MATRON
                         Oh!

                              and NUN)
                         C'estqu'il veut manger!

               Everyone smiles. The NUN titters. The MOTHER SUPERIOR and 
               the MATRON have a hurried conference out of which the MATRON 
               emerges with an invitation. While they have talked, GENERAL 
               CANDY looks down the crowded tables. He sees a girl.

               She is seated about halfway down the table. She has eaten 
               and, like several of the nurses, has fallen asleep.

               CLIVE stares and stares. He knows that face and we know it 
               too. The girl wears her hair differently, she is much younger 
               than Edith Hunter - but her face is very like Edith's. CLIVE 
               longs to see the colour of her eyes.

               [[The MATRON turns to him.

                                     MATRON

                         join us? We shall all be delighted.

               The MATRON leads the way down the table. CLIVE will pass 
               quite close to the girl.

                                     MATRON

                         was with the Italians. I was lucky. 
                         I came through Caporetto without a 
                         scratch.

               MATRON laughs heartily.

               As they pass the sleeping girl, CLIVE CANDY stops 
               involuntarily. Yes, the girl is strangely like Edith Hunter. 
               The MATRON is now at the head of the table.

               A plate is put before CLIVE loaded with macaroni.

               We see with CLIVE'S eyes the girl start to wake up. She smiles 
               sleepily.

                                     MATRON
                         It must be an incredible sight.

               He eats his macaroni, never taking his eyes off the girl.

               The MATRON puts CLIVE'S vague way of talking down to 
               tiredness. The nurses around are all starting to get up and 
               a general exodus starts towards the door. The girl stands up 
               with the others as the bench is pushed back.

               MURDOCH is talking to the sentry.

               As the GENERAL appears, MURDOCH jumps to the rear door of 
               the car and opens it. The sentry salutes.

               GENERAL CANDY snaps an acknowledgement at the sentry, ignores 
               MURDOCH,, opens the front door of the car, hurls himself 
               into the seat beside the driver and slams the door. MURDOCH,

               driver's seat.

                         14'; they mended the line, sir.

               CLIVE reads it.

                                     D.R.
                         Any answer, sir?

                                     CLIVE
                         No. No answer.

               The DESPATCH RIDER wheels and thunders away. MURDOCH looks 
               queerly at the GENERAL.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Anything wrong, sir?

               CLIVE shakes his head. They are alone in the immense 
               landscape, battered and trampled by four years of senseless, 
               stalemate war. CLIVE takes a flask from his pocket, unscrews 
               the little cup and fills it with brandy. He hands this to 
               MURDOCH. CLIVE stands holding the flask.

                                     CLIVE
                         Murdoch - the war is over.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Is it, sir?  

                                     CLIVE
                         The Germans have accepted the terms 
                         of the Armistice.  Hostilities cease 
                         at ten o'clock.
                              (He looks at his watch.)
                         [[It is now a quarter to ten.]] [It's 
                         nearly that now.] 

                                     [[MURDOCH
                              (Struggles with words, 
                              then gives up. They 
                              drink.)
                         God bless us, sir.

                                     CLIVE
                         Yes, Murdoch, may God bless us in 
                         peace as He has in Victory.

               He turns full of emotion and walks a step or two. 

               He turns and listens.

               Far away, born on the wind, there comes the sound of a mighty 
               cheering, louder and louder as every moment passes. 

               CLIVE turns to MURDOCH. He is exultant.]] 

                                     CLIVE
                         Murdoch! do you know what this means? 

                                     MURDOCH
                         I do, sir. Peace. We can go home. 
                         Everybody can go home! 

                                     CLIVE
                         For me, Murdoch, it means more than 
                         that. It means that Right is Might 
                         after all. The Germans have shelled 
                         hospitals, bombed open towns, sunk 
                         neutral ships, used poison-gas - and 
                         we won! Clean fighting, honest 
                         soldiering have won! God bless you, 
                         Murdoch.

                                     [MURDOCH
                         Sir!]

               They both drink.

               [Sound of birdsong. Both look up to the sky.

               A large and busy mill. Going closer to the machines, we see 
               the last lengths of khaki cloth vanishing off the looms: 
               cloth, wool, cotton materials, all finishing.  In the dyeing 
               vats the khaki dyes are emptied away: new beautiful dyes 
               appear: the looms are busy again. Gay patterns, bright tweeds 
               are appearing. The first length of cloth off the looms is 
               for a bridal gown.

               After an interval of four years the first piece of white 
               brocade has come off the looms in the famous Mills of Mr. 
               Christopher Wynne, head of the well-known West Riding family. 
               The cloth is destined for the bridal gown of Miss Barbara 
               Wynne, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wynne, whose marriage

                                    Exterior: The Hall

               A beautiful, large garden. The great pile of 'The Hall' in 
               the distance. The tiny figure of the HOUSEKEEPER on the 
               terrace. Faintly her voice is heard calling: 'Barbaraa!  - 
               [Lunch is ready.] Miss Barbaraaaaaaaa!!'  

               In another part of the grounds, BARBARA WYNNEand CLIVE CANDY 
               are talking together. A great sweep of country is visible 
               beyond a great yew hedge.

               They have the copy of the Yorkshire Telegraph and Argus with 
               them.

               BARBARA is, of course, the same girl whom we have seen in 
               nurse's uniform in the Convent of the 'Crown of Thorns'. She 
               is dressed in what, in 1919, was considered a ravishing 
               creation: rather like a badly tied sack.

               CLIVE is in uniform. He is a full Brigadier now. He looks 
               very strong and fit, far less than his forty-three years. 
               Distantly we hear 'Barbaraaaa!'  

                                     CLIVE
                         Oh dear.

                                     BARBARA
                              (Laughing])
                         Don't listen [to her]!
                              (Accusingly.)
                         Now!  [You listen to me.] There I 
                         was asleep! You never saw me before - 
                         you never [even] spoke to me then - 
                         how could you be so sure?

                                     CLIVE
                         Can I ask you a question first? 

                                     BARBARA
                         You're wriggling! All right, fire 
                         away! 

                                     CLIVE
                         How can you be so sure?  I'm twenty 
                         years older than you - and I'm a 
                         soldier. When other people are 
                         thanking God the war is over, I am 
                         going to the War Office to ask: Where 
                         is another war where you can use me?

                                     BARBARA
                              (Seriously)
                         You asked me that once [before] and 
                         I told you [[why]].

                                     CLIVE
                         I'm asking you again because I want 
                         to hear it again [and again].

               He says this so charmingly that she has to answer. 

                                     BARBARA
                         I'm marrying you because I want to 
                         join the Army and see the world. I'm 
                         marrying you because I [[like seeing]] 
                         [love watching] you play polo. I'm 
                         marrying you for fifty reasons that 
                         all mean that's how I imagined my 
                         future husband!

               CLIVE looks at her.

                                     CLIVE
                         Same here! That's how I imagined my 
                         future wife!

               BARBARA looks at him. It is one of the moments that come 
               seldom in life and extend indefinitely until some outside 
               influence breaks them. 

               The beating of a big gong comes from the house. BARBARA sighs.

                                     BARBARA
                         The gong is the final appeal. We 
                         must go, darling. We have the Bishop 
                         for lunch.

                                     CLIVE
                         I hope he's tender.

               They start up the garden, hand in hand.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A very fine room, full of good, solid stuff and good, solid 
               people.  The BISHOP is making a little speech.

               MR and MRS WYNNE, BARBARA and CLIVE are listening.

                                     BISHOP
                         ... and now [[let me]] [in conclusion, 
                         I should like to] say a few words to 
                         Brigadier-General Andy. We in the 
                         Church Militant can admire the heroes 
                         of the war. But in our hearts we are 
                         men of peace. Therefore, I am glad 
                         to have met you as I did for the 
                         first time on a simple and heart-
                         warming occasion [[and not]] [rather 
                         than] at some military celebration. 
                         When I first heard that a Brigadier-
                         General of the British Army was 
                         arranging a ball for the benefit of 
                         those nurses from the West Riding 
                         who took part in the four years' 
                         struggle, I said [to myself]: There 
                         is a man whose heart is in the right 
                         place.
                              (He refers to slip of 
                              paper.)
                         And I am glad to announce that one 
                         result is that a total of £131.2.6 
                         will be handed over to the War Nurses' 
                         Benevolent Fund.

               During the BISHOP'S speech, CLIVE and BARBARA have glanced 
               at each other several times. CLIVE is guiltily rolling bread 
               pills. At the finish, after a little hesitation, he gets up 
               and stumbles into a speech replying. He starts to tell his 
               story as a good joke but as he sees it is falling flat, he 
               gets more and more self-conscious, while as he speaks the 
               faces of his listeners get more and more embarrassed. Only 
               BARBARA is unperturbed.

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Your Grace]] [My Lord Bishop], I 
                         want to make a confession. You see, 
                         I first saw Barbara in Flanders on 
                         the last night of the war.
                              ((He glances at MRS 
                              WYNNE.)
                         She was a nurse among seventy other 
                         nurses - I never knew her name -but 
                         I found out that most of the nurses 
                         came from Yorkshire - the West Riding - 
                         and of course she was a nurse - 
                         [[well]] [so], I thought - Yorkshire's 
                         a big place - [[Your Grace]] [My 
                         Lord Bishop] - so, I thought, how 
                         can I find a nurse in Yorkshire? You - 
                         understand who I'm driving at - I 
                         suppose - what I mean? -

               There is a painful silence. The BISHOP does not rise to the 
               occasion. But BARBARA does. She reaches for CLIVE'S hand and 
               holds it, smiling up at him.

                                     BARBARA
                         I understand exactly what you mean, 
                         darling!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A car of the period drives up and stops outside. It is an 
               piled with luggage and dogs.  BARBARA is driving. CLIVE sits 
               beside her. They both look radiantly happy. She wears a 
               wedding ring. They both look up at the house; she

               Critically, he affectionately. It is the first time she sees 
               it.

                                     BARBARA
                         That window is the Den!

                                     CLIVE
                         Wrong. Next floor is the Den. That's 
                         the bathroom. 

               The window in question opens and a large Union Jack on the 
               end of a pole is poked out of the window and socketed into 
               its place. MURDOCH'S head appears behind it. He sees them 
               below, ejaculates: 'It's them!' and disappears.

                         Is yon grey head Murdoch?

                         I shall like Murdoch - and I [[feel]] 
                         [know] I shall like this house. Clive,

                         Den, into which we can always crawl,

                         or badly mauled from our rovings! Or 
                         just to change our spots! [[Do

                         Flood, this house shall stand on its 
                         solid foundations and we'll have a 
                         private lake in the basement.

                                     BARBARA
                         That's a promise. You stay just as

               MURDOCH appears at the entrance and stares in surprise at 
               CLIVE standing there with his hand raised. He runs smartly 
               down the steps. His manner, like his costume, is an Armistice 
               one: half-military, half-civil.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Sorry, Ma'am! - Mrs Candy - I was 
                         [[up]] [at] the top [of the house] - 
                         I wasn't expecting you so early, 
                         sir.

                                     BARBARA
                         So you are Murdoch!

                                     MURDOCH
                         Yes, Madam.

                                     CLIVE
                         The first time I've ever heard him 
                         answer anything but: 'Yes, sir!' 
                         Well, Murdoch, this is [[my]] [the] 
                         wife.

               They shake hands. MURDOCH has his own ideas of what a wife 
               will want to know and he has his report all ready for her as 
               they all go into the house, carrying luggage, etc.) 

                                     MURDOCH
                         Everything is under control, Ma'am. 
                         I've had the telephone installed, 
                         sir.
                              (To BARBARA.)
                         The agency has got a lot of cooks 
                         for you to see, Ma'am, but I bought 
                         plenty of vegetables and flour and 
                         potatoes.
                              ([They go in.])
                         And all the tradespeople have called 
                         and will call again for [your orders] -

               [By this time they have entered the house.]

                                Interior: 33 Cadogan Place

               HALL

               BARBARA listens to MURDOCH with grave attention but CLIVE 
               has no tender regard for his feelings. He interrupts him.  

                                     CLIVE
                         That's all right, Murdoch, but we're 
                         not staying this time. Off tonight.

                                     MURDOCH
                              (Very disappointed)
                         Yes, sir?

                                     CLIVE
                         Paris for eight weeks. When we get 
                         back we'll give a big party and put 
                         our feet up for a bit.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Yes, sir.

                                     BARBARA
                         I'm [so] sorry, Murdoch.
                              (She makes a friend.)

                                     MURDOCH
                              (Grins ruefully)
                         [[I'm]] [We're] used to it [[Ma'am]].
                              ([[To CLIVE)
                         I got your letters from the Club, 
                         sir - they're on the little tray.]]

               CLIVE crosses to the table. MURDOCH continues to BARBARA: 

                                     MURDOCH
                         I told the porter that the Brigadier 
                         wouldn't be using the Club so much 
                         in future, Ma'am.

                                     BARBARA
                         And what did he say?

               MURDOCH hesitates.

                                     BARBARA
                         [Go on, Murdoch,] I can bear it, 
                         [[Murdoch]].

                                     MURDOCH
                         [[Yes, Ma'am.]] He said: They all 
                         say that at first!' - Ma'am.

               BARBARA laughs. MURDOCH smiles respectfully and withdraws 
               with the dogs.

                                     CLIVE
                         I say, Barbara - !
                              (She crosses to him.)
                         Here's an answer from the Prisoners 
                         of War Committee -

                              pleased)

                         Oberst, 2nd Regiment of Ulans of the 
                         Guard.  That's him! Camp VII Hardwick 
                         Hall, Derbyshire. Poor old Theo!

               He stares at the paper, pulling at his moustache.

               BARBARA knows what is going on in his mind.

                                     BARBARA
                         Darling!

               CLIVE looks up, worried. His face lights up as he sees her 
               expression.

                                     BARBARA
                         Let's postpone Paris... I'd love to

               A notice, roughly printed by hand on a sheet of cardboard, 
               is nailed to a tree:

               While the notice is being read, we hear the tragically sweet 
               melody of the Second Movement of Schubert's 'Unfinished 
               Symphony'.

               The camera moves off the notice [[to the tree above. It has 
               wide-spreading branches, all loaded with German officers, 
               listening to the music. We see some of their faces. We see, 
               from their angle in the tree,]]

               [to a sentry on guard duty, and on to] the main audience and 
               the orchestra itself. All are German officers. The orchestra 
               plays on a raised bank, a natural rostrum. The audience covers 
               the smooth lawns that run down to the river, which is crossed 
               by two bridges, with an island in the middle. There is a 
               Guard House on the island and the bridge is heavily wired 
               with barbed wire above and below and English sentries are 
               stationed on the bridge.

               The prisoners sit on benches or on the grass, many are 
               standing, all are listening intently to the music. There 
               must be 400 or 500 of them. The orchestra has about forty 
               pieces.

               We see an ORDERLY coming towards the concert from the main 
               building. This is a fine old country house which has been 
               taken over. It is now surrounded by huts and all kinds of 
               administrative buildings. The main offices are in the house 
               itself. The ORDERLY carries a message-pad. He comes amongst 
               the audience as discreetly as possible. [[He is obviously 
               looking for someone and, as obviously, cannot spot him. He 
               decides to ask one of the officers, who is leaning against a 
               tree. The officer questioned looks around, then shakes his 
               head and taps the leg of another officer in the tree above 
               him. He whispers to him. The officer in the tree has a bird's-
               eye view. He spots the wanted man and the information is 
               passed on in whispers to the ORDERLY. The ORDERLY gingerly 
               crosses through the audience. Nobody looks at him.]]

               He finds his man- OBERST KRETSCHMAR-SCHULDORFF - and touches 
               him on the shoulder. 

                                     [ORDERLY:
                         Message, sir, from the Commandant's 
                         office.]

               THEO turns to the ORDERLY. Of course, he, too, is seventeen 
               years older. He still bears the scar which he got in the 
               duel. The ORDERLY gives him the message-pad. THEO reads the 
               message. He is surprised at its contents but, without any 
               hesitation, he shakes his head very firmly.

                                     [THEO
                         No answer.]

               He gives the message-pad back to the ORDERLY and turns once 
               more to listen to the music.

               The ORDERLY is rather at a loss. After a moment's hesitation, 
               he starts all over again, emphasizing the importance of the 
               message.

               THEO loses patience with him. He answers almost savagely.

                                     THEO
                              (Louder than he had 
                              meant to)
                         No [answer]!!  

               Heads turn. Voices go: 'Sh-sh-sh!'

               The ORDERLY beats a retreat.

               The tall french windows are open and the music can be heard 
               in the distance.

               The Commandant, MAJOR DAVIES, is an elderly man and a bit of 
               a philosopher.

               CLIVE is in a new suit of tweeds with a regimental tie. 
               BARBARA wears a summer dress and hat which, in 1919 and in 
               1919 alone, was considered lovely.

               The ORDERLY knocks and enters - alone.

                         thinking], how odd they are!  How 
                         queer!  For years and years they are 
                         writing and dreaming wonderful music 
                         and [[wonderful]] [beautiful] poetry 
                         and then [[suddenly]] [all of a 
                         sudden] they start a war, shoot 
                         innocent hostages, sink undefended 
                         ships, bomb and destroy whole streets 
                         in London, killing little children - 
                         and then, dressed in the same 
                         butcher's uniform, they sit down and 
                         [[play]] [listen to] [[Beethoven]] 
                         [Mendelssohn] and Schubert.  There's 
                         something horrible about that, don't 
                         you think so Clive?

               Such abstractions are caviare to the GENERAL but he is 
               impressed by BARBARA'S speech.  He nods and grunts agreement.

                                     CLIVE
                         Hm - mm - [[something in that - good 
                         deal in fact - ]] 

               It is the first time there is something 'blimpish' in his 
               manner.

               The symphony ends.  Distant and prolonged applause.  CLIVE 
               stands up.

                                     CLIVE
                         Major Davies, would you mind if I 
                         went down and had a try?  Perhaps it 
                         was because of the music - there's 
                         an interval now.

                                     MAJOR DAVIES

                         had better [[stay]] 
                         [remain].

               BARBARA, who has risen, sits again.  She and MAJOR DAVIES 
               understand each other.  CLIVE nods and moves to the windows.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Half to himself)

                         to him before the war and he has 
                         written to me...

               He vanishes out on the terrace.

                                     MAJOR DAVIES

                                       SEQUENCE 77

                              Exterior: Prisoner of War Camp

               In the interval of the concert, the audience has broken up 
               into groups, individuals are pacing up and down, some are 
               smoking and talking.

               There is no loud chatter or laughter. The general effect is 
               serious, even solemn. Depression bangs over the stiff-necked 
               assembly. CLIVE comes down from the house, walking quickly, 
               looking about him for THEO.

               He comes among the groups of officers. Nobody takes direct 
               notice of him.

               The orchestra starts to tune up. People start to move back 
               to their places.

               CLIVE stops one group and addresses a senior officer.

                                     CLIVE
                         Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff?

                                     OFFICER
                              (After a sharp stare)
                         [[Behind you.]] [Over there.]

               He moves off. CLIVE whirls round. 

               He stands directly in between THEO and his place. THEO is 
               advancing straight towards him, separated by two or three 
               groups, also moving to their places.

               Seeing CLIVE, THEO stops. Not a muscle of his face or light   
               in his eyes betrays his thoughts.

               CLIVE, on the contrary, advances with a broad smile that 
               overflows his whole being. He is coming to his friend. He 
               puts out his hand...

                                     CLIVE
                         Theo!

               THEO turns and walks away. 

               It is the greatest shock CLIVE has ever had. He stands 
               petrified, staring after his friend.

               THEO throws away his cigarette, treads on it and returns to 
               his place in the audience. Nearly everyone has settled 
               himself. CLIVE is left standing alone.

               [[The Conductor takes his place amid polite applause.]]

               [The music starts again.]

               CLIVE shakes his head as if he still can't believe what has 
               happened to him. He looks ten years older.

               He turns and slowly walks away.

               THEO never looks after him.

               The orchestra plays the opening chords of [[Beethoven's Fifth 
               Symphony]] [Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture].  CLIVE goes on 
               towards the house. He again shakes his head. For the second 
               time, there is something 'blimpish' in his behaviour.

               He stops and looks back, almost as if he is expected to see 
               the figure of his friend, hastening after him.  But the lawn 
               between him and the distant audience is empty.

               Distantly we hear the [[Fifth Symphony] Hebrides Overture,

                         you?
                              (The MAJOR looks at 
                              her.)
                         What I mean is that we know that the 
                         Germans in peacetime are a tidy law-
                         loving people of poets, philosophers 
                         and composers; and then -

               CLIVE appears at the window. He has recovered himself a 
               little. He comes in.

                                     CLIVE
                         Well, it's true. I saw him and he 
                         wouldn't speak to me.
                              (He looks at BARBARA 
                              and sits down.)
                         I wouldn't have believed it possible. 
                         He was as close as I am to you and 
                         he turned away without saying a word. 
                         You could have knocked me down with 
                         a feather! 
                              (BARBARA gives him 
                              his tea. He stirs 
                              it.)
                         I kept on looking back, you know. I 
                         couldn't believe he wasn't joking.
                              (To MAJOR DAVIES)
                         What on earth is wrong with him?

                                     MAJOR DAVIES
                         The same thing as all the others. 
                         They call it 'Ehre'. The literal 
                         translation is 'Honour' but actually 
                         I suppose it means 'Dignity'.

                                     CLIVE
                         What 'Dignity', what 'Honour'?  Who 
                         has hurt his 'Ehre'? They lost, we 
                         won. What of it. We've been defeated 
                         too sometimes. Fortune of war!

               While talking, they have walked towards the dining room where 
               the hum of conversation has got louder. As they go in, the 
               telephone in the hall rings. MURDOCH answers it. He has a 
               special voice for answering the telephone, full of old-world 
               courtesy.

                                     MURDOCH
                         This is Brigadier-General Candy's 
                         residence ...

                         And who, may I ask, is speaking?...

                                     [VOICE:
                         This is Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, 
                         speaking from Victoria Station. And 
                         tell him I'm leaving tonight.]

                                     MURDOCH
                         Would you mind repeating the name, 
                         sir...

               He obviously hasn't got the name but is too polite to say 
               so. He puts down the receiver and goes to get his master.

               We go close to the receiver. The man at the other end of the 
               wire is whistling - the Mignon Aria. CLIVE and MURDOCH come 
               from the dining room.

                         Couldn't he 'phone tomorrow? Where's 
                         he speaking from?

                                     MURDOCH

                         tonight he said.

                         It sounded like Wretch-Bar Something,

               He snatches up the receiver and mouthpiece, he listens, grins, 
               whistles in reply, laughs. He has quite forgotten the 
               impression he had been given at the prison camp, he is so 
               pleased to be friendly to his friend again.

               A SENTRY is standing on guard at the door, to keep people 
               away. On the door is a sign, such as: 'O.H.M.S.'

               The SENTRY sees someone approaching across the station. He 
               springs to attention, shoulders arms, salutes.

               It is MAJOR DAVIES, MAJOR-GENERAL BLOMFIELD and BRIGADIER-
               GENERAL CANDY who are bearing down on him, all smoking cigars 
               and all unmistakable senior officers, although in dinner-
               jackets (except MAJOR DAVIES).

                                     MAJOR DAVIES
                         Lieutenant Cartwright inside?

                         Ask him to step outside, sentry!

               The SENTRY smartly grounds arms, turns, goes and opens the 
               door. We see a glimpse of the crowded room, thick with smoke.

                                     SENTRY
                              (Calls)

               reports:

               LIEUTENANT CARTWRIGHT appears. He is quite shaken by the 
               senior officers.

                         Call the Oberst out. I'll be 
                         responsible. You can have me and the 
                         Major as hostages.

                                     CARTWRIGHT
                         That will be all right, sir.

               He vanishes into the room.

                         Now look here - I can't leave you

                                     BLOMFIELD
                         Don't worry - you can't finish the 
                         port by 11.30.

               The door is opened by CARTWRIGHT and THEO appears, a doubtful 
               smile on his face. He carries his suitcase and greatcoat. 
               CLIVE goes to him and this time THEO doesn't turn away.

               WAITING ROOM

               The Tribunal sits in a requisitioned school. This room was a 
               classroom, but has been transformed into a waiting room.  
               Benches and chairs line the walls. The room is full of 
               nervous, gloomy people of all ages and sexes, waiting to be 
               called.  In the next room, their fates are being decided. 
               The door to it opens and a uniformed policeman comes out 
               with the papers of two men.

                                     POLICEMAN:
                              (Calls)
                         Mr H. Bruck and Mr S. Bruck.

               The two brothers hold up their hands and answer: 'Here!' 
               They stand up as the POLICEMAN comes to them and hands back 
               their books and Identity Cards.

                                     POLICEMAN

               the tribunal.]]

                                       SEQUENCE 93

                                         Tribunal

               This was also a classroom. It is smaller than the other but 
               there is plenty of room. Behind a desk are seated two men: 
               one is the JUDGE, the other an inspector from Scotland Yard 
               (in mufti). Beside the desk sits a middle-aged Englishwoman 
               from the Refugee Committee. She also interprets, if necessary. 
               In a corner, near the door, is a plain wood table, where a 
               uniformed policeman sits. He has lists and rubber stamps, 
               comes from the 'Local' Police Station and stamps the papers 
               after the interrogation.

               The tone of the inquiry is impersonal at first, but later 
               becomes more sympathetic. The JUDGE has the Home Office file 
               of the person interviewed in front of him; it is pretty fully 
               documented but he prefers to use it only as a check on their 
               own stories. The inspector does not speak unless asked.

               THEO enters, comes to his place, clicks his heels together 
               (such customs die hard with a German), bows very gently and 
               waits to be questioned.  When he speaks he is unafraid, like 
               a man who has nothing to lose by the truth.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorff?

                                     THEO
                         [[Yes.]] [Here.]

                                     JUDGE
                         Sit down.

                                     THEO
                         Thank you.

                                     JUDGE

               He has them in his hand and passes them over.

                         Yes.

                                     JUDGE
                         Why did you leave Germany?

                                     JUDGE
                         Most refugees left Germany early in 
                         1933, when Hitler came to power...

                                     THEO
                         I had nothing to fear from Hitler. 
                         At least I thought so. It took me 
                         eight months to find out I was wrong.

                                     JUDGE
                         Rather a long time.

               THEO is silent.

                                     JUDGE
                         Don't you think so?  

                                     THEO
                         Please, I mean no offence - but you 
                         in England took five years.

               The policeman in the corner looks up, but no fire descends 
               from heaven. The JUDGE merely remarks.

                                     JUDGE
                              (Drily)
                         Quite right.
                              (Pause.)
                         Have you been in England before?

                                     THEO
                         Yes. I was a prisoner of war in the 
                         last war.

                                     JUDGE
                              (Looking in file)
                         I see you were an officer. When did 
                         you leave the army?

                                     THEO
                         In 1920 — eight out of ten officers 
                         had to retire when the German Army 
                         ceased to exist — I mean as a large 
                         army...

                                     JUDGE
                         You prefer the existence of a large 
                         army?  

                                     THEO
                         [[No]] [Not any more]. In 1920 I 
                         chose a new profession — Military 
                         Chemist — I worked for thirteen years 
                         in a factory at Mannheim.

                                     JUDGE
                         Are you married?

                                     JUDGE
                         Children?  

                                     THEO
                         Two. I have no connection with them. 
                         They are good Nazis - as far as any 
                         Nazi can be called good.

               THEO'S frankness has made an impression on the JUDGE; but, 
               at the same time, he has decided to intern him. The 
               presentation of the facts has been too unvarnished. THEO, of 
               course, senses this.

                                     JUDGE
                         [[Well,]] I'm afraid, Mr Kretschmar-
                         Schuldorff, that doesn't sound very 
                         much in your favour.

                                     THEO
                              (Wryly)
                         I have tried to answer correctly.

                                     JUDGE
                              (Sympathetically)
                         [[No doubt, but-]] [Personally, I 
                         don't doubt your good faith. But I 
                         am here to safeguard my country's 
                         interests. You may be an anti-Nazi. 
                         You may not be. In times like these,

                         the same - and that our enemy was

                         those who are really with us. But it 
                         should be their best assurance that

                         Never lie, always speak the truth.

                         I have not told a lie. But I also 
                         have not told the truth. A refugee 
                         soon learns that there is a great 
                         difference between the two.

               He pauses. The JUDGE nods.

                         The truth about me is that I am a

                         to this country because he is 
                         homesick.
                              (He smiles.)
                         Don't stare at me, sir, I am all 
                         right in the head. You [[see]] [know 
                         that], after the war, we had very 
                         bad years in Germany. We got poorer 
                         and poorer. Every day retired officers 
                         or schoolteachers were caught 
                         shoplifting. Money lost its value, 
                         the price of everything rose except 
                         of human beings. We read in the 
                         newspapers that the after-war years 
                         were bad everywhere, that crime was 
                         increasing and that honest citizens 
                         were having a hard job to put the 
                         gangsters in jail [[where they 
                         belonged]]. Well, [I need hardly 
                         tell you that] in Germany, the 
                         gangsters [[started to put]] [finally 
                         succeeded in putting] the honest 
                         citizens in jail. [[Do you know, 
                         sir, who were the first pillars of 
                         the Nazi Party? The dirt of the 
                         people, the lazy ones, the drunkards, 
                         the scum of the country. Ask, sir, 
                         all these people who come here before 
                         you. They will remember them. In 
                         every business there was one who had 
                         no talent and no desire to work or 
                         to learn; and one morning he appeared 
                         with a brown shirt on and a revolver 
                         in his holster. Then they were joined 
                         by the huge army of easy-going people 
                         who always say: 'I am an engineer 
                         and I understand engines: that's 
                         enough forme!']] My wife was English. 
                         She would have loved to [[return]] 
                         [come back] to England, but it seemed 
                         to me that I would have been letting 
                         down my country in its greatest need, 
                         and [so] she stayed at my side. [[When 
                         at last she would have come]] [When 
                         in summer '33, we found that we had 
                         lost both our children to the Nazi 
                         Party, and I was willing to come], 
                         she died. Neither of my sons came to 
                         her funeral [Heil Hitler]... and 
                         then in January [[1934]] [1935],!  
                         [[came up alone]] [had to go] to 
                         Berlin on a mission for my firm. I 
                         drove up in my car. I lost my way on 
                         the outskirts of the city, and 
                         suddenly [[I recognized] I the 
                         landscape [seemed familiar to me. 
                         Slowly I recognized] the road, the 
                         lake and a nursing home, where I 
                         spent some weeks recovering [[many]] 
                         [almost forty] years ago. I stopped 
                         the car and sat still remembering. 
                         [You see, sir,] in this very nursing 
                         home, I met my wife for the first 
                         time ... and I met an Englishman who 
                         became my [[best]] [greatest] friend 
                         [[all those years, although we have 
                         only met twice since then — in 1919]]. 
                         [And I remembered] the people at the 
                         station [in '19], when we [prisoners] 
                         were sent home, cheering us, [treating 
                         us like friends] ... and the faces 
                         [[round a polished table]] of a party 
                         of distinguished men who were kind 
                         and [[did their best]] [tried their 
                         utmost] to comfort me when the defeat 
                         of my country seemed to me 
                         unbearable... And very foolishly I 
                         remembered the [[English]] 
                         countryside, [the gardens,] the green lawns [[where I spent the long months of captivity]], the weedy rivers and the trees she loved so much. [And] a great desire came over me to come back [[here]] to my wife's country. [[At first I couldn't get a permit. But I tried - and tried again.]] [And this, sir, is the truth.

               Silence in the schoolroom after THEO'S long speech. The JUDGE 
               rises and walks round the table.

                                     JUDGE
                         Haven't you got anyone in this country 
                         who knows you well, a British citizen?  

                                     THEO

                         Don't you know Major-General Clive 
                         Wynne-Candy?

                                     THEO
                         Yes, I used to know him.

                                     JUDGE
                         Did you ask him to come here and 
                         testify on your behalf?  

                                     THEO
                         Yes, I did send him a letter, but I 
                         suppose he... 

               The door opens and CLIVE appears. 

               [[During his last words a disturbance has started outside 
               and has gradually grown in intensity, doors are slamming, 
               voices are raised and, as everyone looks around at the door, 
               it bursts open and, flanked by awed policemen, MAJOR-GENERAL 
               WYNNE-CANDY enters the room]].

               He is, of course, three years younger than when we met him 
               in the Turkish Bath at the beginning of our story, but he is 
               physically much the same and he is much more self-assured 
               and pompous now, before the disappointments of the next three 
               years have deflated him. He talks very loudly and goes 
               straight to the JUDGE as the only person worthy of his 
               attention, beside THEO.

               He flings his card down on the table.

               CLIVE has grabbed THEO, pleased and bewildered[[, turned him 
               to the light and slaps him on the back]].

                         to come here — the war, I suppose - 
                         so I dropped Buggy Prendergast at 
                         the Club - he'd had enough - and 
                         came along myself to take you home 
                         with me -

                         If it's all right with you, sir.

               CLIVE obviously takes it for granted that it is.

               He turns on the poor JUDGE, who starts to assert himself.

                         you're absolutely right! I apologize!

               He extends his hand, the JUDGE has to take it. CLIVE shakes 
               it vigorously and points to THEO, who is looking admiringly 
               at his friend's easy authority.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                       SEQUENCE 94

                                Interior: 33 Cadogan Place

               DINING ROOM

               CLIVE and THEO are sitting on after dinner, smoking in 
               companionable silence. There is an enormous difference between 
               the two men. For CLIVE very little has changed; for THEO 
               everything: he has seen less than CLIVE during the years but 
               he has experienced more. He is a wise man now. He speaks 
               with a little smile about the most important things. His 
               attitude is that of a man very little concerned with life's 
               troubles. He has nothing to lose because he has lost 
               everything.

               Outside it is quite late. It is winter. The windows are 
               shuttered.

               [[After a moment THEO looks at his watch.]] [Clock chimes.]

                                     THEO
                         It's time I was going. [[I must be 
                         home by midnight.]] 

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Why midnight?]] [The night is young 
                         yet.]

                                     THEO
                         [Don't you remember?] Curfew for 
                         aliens.

                                     CLIVE
                              (Blimpish nod)
                         Ah-yes...

                                     [THEO
                         I have to be home by midnight.

               MURDOCH comes in. He is about the same age as his master and 
               has become, over the years, the perfect butler.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Don't forget, sir. You have to be up 
                         for 6.30. 

                                     CLIVE
                         Early parade, eh?  

                                     MURDOCH
                         Yes.

               He leaves.

                                     THEO
                         How lucky you are.

                                     CLIVE
                         Yes, they put me on the retired list 
                         in '35. But I knew they'd want me 
                         again. Back I went on the active 
                         list like a shot.
                              (Changes the subject.])
                         I mean, why don't you stay here? 
                         I've eighteen rooms.
                              (Bellows.)
                         Murdoch!

                                     THEO
                         Thanks, Clive, but I don't think I 
                         had better. I would need a special 
                         permit anyway.

               MURDOCH comes in.

                                     MURDOCH
                         You called, sir? 

                                     CLIVE
                         All right, Murdoch, it was nothing—no!  
                         [[As you were!]]
                              (To THEO)
                         Stay a little longer, I'll send you 
                         back by car. Murdoch, tell Miss Cannon 
                         to be here at quarter to twelve.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Yes, sir.

               He goes.

                                     THEO
                         Who's Miss Cannon?

                                     CLIVE
                         [[Johnny]] [Miss] Cannon, my driver. 
                         [[A.T.S.]] [M.T.C.]

                                     THEO
                         [Do you] Remember, Clive, we used to 
                         say: 'Our army is fighting for our 
                         homes, our women and our children'?  
                         Now the women are fighting beside 
                         the men. [[In Germany,]] the children 
                         are trained to shoot. [[Only remains]] 
                         [What's left is]: the 'home'. But 
                         what is 'home' without women and 
                         children?

                                     CLIVE
                              (Nods, then says 
                              suddenly)
                         You never met my wife. Do you want 
                         to see [a picture of] her?

                                     THEO
                         Very much...
                              (They both laugh as 
                              they stand up.)
                         ... do you remember when that was 
                         all I could say in English?

                                     CLIVE
                         You got further with it [then] than 
                         I ever got.

                                     THEO
                         In what respect? 

                                     CLIVE
                         My dear fellow, don't tell me you 
                         [[never knew]] [didn't know]...

                                     THEO
                         What? 

                                     CLIVE
                         [[That I - dash it, don't]] [you] 
                         make me blush!

                                     THEO
                         But I don't know what you are talking 
                         about.

                                     CLIVE
                         Well - I thought it was written all 
                         over my face when I left Berlin in 
                         [[19]]02.

                                     THEO
                         Don't forget, I never saw [[you]] 
                         [your face] after you left.

                                     CLIVE
                              (It is a great secret)
                         I was in love with [her - ] your 
                         wife.

                                     THEO
                              (Slowly)
                         She never told me...

                                     CLIVE
                         She never knew.

                                     THEO
                         But [[when I told you]] [I seem to 
                         remember] - that last day [in Berlin] - 
                         [[that I loved her]] - you seemed 
                         genuinely happy...

                                     CLIVE
                         Dash it - I didn't know then. But on 
                         the train I started to miss her - it 
                         was worse on the boat - and by the 
                         time I was back in London -well, I'd 
                         got it properly. My Aunt Margaret 
                         got on the scent [[right]] [straight] 
                         away, women have a nose for these 
                         things. Besides I did a stupid thing!  
                         First night back I took out her 
                         sister... 

                                     THEO
                         Aunt Margaret's?

                                     CLIVE
                         Edith's.

                                     THEO
                              (More puzzled)
                         Martha?

                                     CLIVE
                         Yes. Martha.

                                     THEO
                         But what was stupid about that? 

                                     CLIVE
                              (Gruffly)
                         Thinking her sister would be like 
                         she was.

                                     THEO
                         [Like] Edith?

               CLIVE nods.

                                     [CLIVE
                         Yes.] 

                                     THEO
                              (Tenderly)
                         [[Anyway]] [Well], you got over it.

                                     CLIVE
                         That's just it, I [[didn't]] [never 
                         did get over it]. Theo, this may 
                         sound a damn silly thing to say to 
                         you but I never got over it. [[I 
                         suppose you could]] [You may] say 
                         she was my ideal - if you were some 
                         [sort of] sickening long-haired poet 
                         — all my life I've been looking for 
                         a girl like her—so now you know —

                                     THEO
                              (Quite thunderstruck)
                         I never thought it possible that an 
                         Englishman could be so romantic...
                              (Pause.)
                         And your wife you don't mind my 
                         asking? You loved her...?

                                     CLIVE
                         Yes... dreadfully. She was exactly 
                         like Edith. I'll show her to you...

               He takes THEO'S arm and leads him out of the room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                       SEQUENCE 95

                                Interior: 33 Cadogan Place

               CLIVE'S DEN

               The walls are completely crowded with trophies except in one 
               spot which, until now, we have not seen. A painting hangs 
               there, covered by a curtain.

               CLIVE pulls a cord and the curtain slides aside. It is a 
               painting of Barbara at the time of her marriage and very 
               much like her.  THEO looks at the painting for quite a little 
               time before he speaks.

                                     THEO
                              (Quietly)
                         She's very lovely.

                                     CLIVE
                         Isn't she like Edith? Eh? See the 
                         resemblance?

               Now actually it is quite hard for THEO to see any resemblance 
               at all. CLIVE'S memory of Edith is different from THEO'S. 
               She has always stayed young to him as he last saw her. THEO 
               continues to stare at the picture.

                                     THEO
                              (Answering CLIVE)
                         Yes... there is something very 
                         striking... But you mustn't forget, 
                         I saw Edith thirty-one years later 
                         than you. We grew old together - you 
                         understand?

                                     CLIVE
                              (Blimpish agreement)
                         Hm! -yes— [[suppose so]] [of course] 
                         — but she was [[very]] [exactly] 
                         like her -

                                     THEO
                              (Looking round)
                         It's a strange place to hang such a 
                         lovely picture.

                                     CLIVE
                         She wanted it. I call this my Den, 
                         you know. She knew I always used to

                         it - all my stuff is here. It would 
                         be an awful gap without her ...

               CLIVE stands in the half-open door, a bright light streams 
               from the hall. THEO is beside him in an overcoat of obvious 
               Continental cut.

               MURDOCH stands half-way with a torch.  The car, JOHNNY CANNON 
               at the wheel, is waiting.

               CLIVE shakes hands warmly with THEO.

               [[But he closes it all the same and looks around.]]

               THEO gets in beside the driver. He opens the window as MURDOCH 
               fusses around.

               JOHNNY CANNON seems to be a very efficient, matter-of-fact 
               girl, judging by her voice. Neither can see the other in the 
               black-out.

                                     [[THEO
                         You don't mind my sitting beside

                         It must be difficult driving in the 
                         black-out. 

                                     JOHNNY
                         [[It looks more than it is.]] [It's 
                         not as bad as it looks, sir.]

               After a pause THEO goes on talking.

                                     THEO
                         I suppose you've done a lot of night-
                         driving? 

                                     JOHNNY
                         No, sir.
                              (She realizes she 
                              must explain this.)
                         I never drove before the war.

                                     THEO
                         What made you learn?

                         My boy-friend taught me. But not at 
                         night.
                              ([[She laughs.]])

                         Is he a good driver? 

                                     JOHNNY
                         First-rate. He's one of the Bentley 
                         boys. [[But]] just now he walks [on 
                         his two flat feet]. He's a private. 
                         In training.

               Pause.

                         [[I heard]] the General [told me 
                         about you].

                         we try to beat the lights, sir?
                              (Brakes sharply.)
                         Sorry, sir, couldn't make it.

                                     THEO
                         Do you like being [[his]] [the 
                         General's] driver?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Who wouldn't?  He's an old darling. 
                         I could have done a hand-stand when 
                         he chose me. [[It was at an 
                         inspection.]] [D'you know] He picked 
                         me out of seven hundred girls to be 
                         his driver.  Some odds [[700 to 1]] 
                         [wasn't it?]

               A car is approaching with a badly fitted mask, the light 
               points higher than it should.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Look at that headlight. He ought to 
                         be reported.

               The headlight flashes for a moment on her face. Only for a 
               moment. THEO stares, startled, at the girl by his side.  He 
               knows now why the General chose her out of seven hundred 
               girls. It is the same face.

               Edith — Barbara — and now this girl.

               The other car has passed.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (Grumbles)
                         That's what causes accidents.
                              (To THEO)
                         Long odds, weren't they, sir?

                                     THEO
                              (In a reverie)
                         I beg your pardon?  

                                     JOHNNY
                         Seven hundred to one! Makes me a bit 
                         of an outsider.
                              (She chuckles.)

                         What is your first name, Miss Cannon?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Angela.

                                     THEO
                         Lovely name. It comes from 'angel' 
                         [doesn't it?].

                                     JOHNNY
                         I think it stinks. My friends call 
                         me 'Johnny'.
                              (She peers out.)
                         Is it this crossing or the next 
                         [,sir]?

                                     THEO
                         [[I'll get out here]] [Oh, this will 
                         do]. [[Many thanks.]]

               He opens the door and gets out. They have stopped by a traffic 
               light. THEO holds out his hand. She shakes it firmly.

                                     THEO
                         Goodnight, Angela.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Goodnight, sir.

                                     THEO
                         I'd like to see your boy-friend one 
                         of these days.

               She laughs.  THEO vanishes into the darkness.

               his best in a very awkward and responsible job. He is about 
               forty-five. [With him is a SECRETARY.]

               The office is underground. The light is crude and glaring.

               He looks tired and worn, but otherwise all right. He glances

               DINING ROOM

               THEO and JOHNNY CANNON are listening to the radio. (June 16 
               was the day Petain came to power.) MURDOCH is making the 
               black-out. The table is laid for two people with a cold 
               supper.  The News finishes. There is a pause.  

               ANNOUNCER: (Rustling paper) [That brings us to the end of 
               the news and] Tonight's Postscript [which] is given by Mr J. 
               B.  Priestley. Mr Priestley ...

               MURDOCH turns sharply. The others react. THEO is not 
               surprised.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What can have happened?

                         I was expecting it.

                         Why?

                         I've read his speech.

               We hear the front door bang. Meanwhile the radio is silent.

                                     MURDOCH
                         The General!

               The GENERAL'S return is a great surprise. JOHNNY leaps to 
               her feet. She has no business to be here. She looks wildly 
               around.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (On radio)

                         is Mr Priestley.

               Without a qualm, MURDOCH turns Mr Priestley off before he 
               has said a word.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Murdoch! Where can I go? The General

                         No fear. Let me out of here!

               The GENERAL comes in. He is not angry; only disappointed.

                         We didn't leave the War Office until

               a drink for ANGELA. She doesn't think it proper to drink

                         in]] France. You commented on Nazi 
                         methods, foul fighting, bombing 
                         refugees, machine-gunning hospitals, 
                         lifeboats, lightships, baled-out 
                         pilots, by saying that you despised 
                         them, that you would be ashamed to 
                         fight on their side and that you 
                         would sooner accept defeat than 
                         victory if it could only be won by 
                         those methods.

                         any methods but Nazi methods! If you

               entirely with THEO. She does not know where to look until 
               directly appealed to by CLIVE. She looks miserably up at him

                         shouldn't give up so easily, my boy. 
                         Is this the same man who took Berlin 
                         by storm forty years ago? Look at 
                         me! Nobody wants me but do I give 
                         up?

               The house we know so well has received a direct hit and lies 
               in ruins, although those on either side are hardly touched.  
               The Demolition Squad are working on the ruins, amongst clouds 
               of dust.

               One of them pulls out a frightening object, coated with dust, 
               from the rubbish.

               He shakes and bangs the hairy object which gradually reveals 
               itself as the pride of Clive's Den: 'Buffalo Head' - 
               'Nigeria''- '1924'.

               They both pull and, in a cloud of dust and clatter of rubble, 
               a rhinoceros']] [a boar's] head emerges. Both regard it

               They deposit their finds on a growing pile of dusty trophies 
               on the pavement. On the steps a shooting-stick is stuck in a 
               flowerpot, a large card clipped in it. One of the men reads

                         Very good, sir.

               CLIVE goes in. The [[Methusalehs]] [young soldiers} present 
               arms [[like guardsmen — which they were]].

                         Arch

               STAFF ROOM

               Maps, street plans, Home Guard manifestos cover the walls 
               and tables.  About twenty staff officers of the Home Guard 
               are waiting around a huge table.

               We recognize some faces from the first Turkish Bath sequence.

               The door opens. MAJOR-GENERAL WYNNE-CANDY has arrived.  
               Everyone stands up.

               He proceeds to the armchair on one side of the round table. 
               He waves them to their seats. He himself remains standing.  
               He is full of energy, radiates enthusiasm. He is obviously a 
               born leader and organizer, extremely popular.

               SPUD WILSON'S pocket commando thundering towards London.  

               It is more 'westerly' than when we picked them up at the 
               beginning of the story.

               ROADHOUSE

               SPUD'S commando pulls in off the road.

               A car is drawn up outside the Roadhouse: a military car, 
               which we know well: GENERAL WYNNE-CANDY'S car.

               SPUD jumps from his truck, also STUFFY. SPUD looks at his 
               watch.

                                     SPUD

               SPUD [enters, glancing at dartboard ('No. 9 — doctor's 
               favourite') and orders 'Tea for two' as he] goes straight to 
               her and kisses her. They make a good job of it.

                         ago with Brigadier-General Caldicott

                         [[What will happen to him?]] [Spud, 
                         sir? He's with his men. They're 
                         marching into London.]

                                     CLIVE
                              (Gruffly)
                         [[He'll be all right.]] [Did you see 
                         them?]

                                     THEO
                         [[When we crossed]] [Yes, we saw 
                         them come across] the Cromwell Road 
                         [[we saw them coming]]. The whole 
                         Army.  With bands.

                                     CLIVE
                              (To ANGELA)
                         Did you see 'em, Angela?

               JOHNNY nods.

                                     CLIVE
                              (To THEO)
                         How [[do]] [did] they look? Eh?

                                     THEO
                         [Well, Clive,] I must say, [[Clive]] 
                         [they]...

                                     JOHNNY
                              (Simultaneously)
                         [Oh,] They looked [[grand]] [OK]!

               From a great distance we hear the sound of military bands 
               approaching nearer and nearer.

               [[CLIVE points towards]] [They go to] where his house once 
               stood.

                                     CLIVE
                         They've cleaned up my place [[quite]] 
                         [rather] nicely.

                                     JOHNNY
                         (Looks) Oh!  They've built an 
                         emergency water [[supply]] [tank] 
                         too!

               They all cross the street. There is the low wall, with 
               'E.W.S.' and the life-belt, so well known to Londoners.  
               They lean on the wall.

                                     [CLIVE
                         I've been thinking this over all 
                         night. I don't want to get this young 
                         fellow into trouble. I think I'll 
                         invite him to dinner instead. Wasn't 
                         I just as much of a young fool as he 
                         is? Of course I was.

                                     THEO
                         Yes, but I wonder if he's going to 
                         be such a grand old man as you are.

                                     CLIVE
                         When I was a young chap, I was all 
                         gas and gaiters with no experience 
                         worth a damn. Now, tons of experience 
                         and nobody thinks I'm any use. I 
                         remember when I got back from Berlin 
                         in '02. Old Betteridge gave me the 
                         worst wigging I ever had. And when 
                         he invited me to dinner, I didn't 
                         accept - often wish I had. Yes, I 
                         think I will invite him to dinner. 
                         And he'd better accept, d'you know!]

               We see the huge tank of deep water where the house once stood. 
               The band sounds very loud and martial: they all listen.

                                     JOHNNY
                         [[They're coming this way.]] [Yes, 
                         sir, here they come.]

               [Sound of marching.]

                                     [[CLIVE
                              (Grunts restlessly)
                         Hm! Better go!

               THEO puts his arm round CLIVE.

                                     THEO
                         Isn't it all the same who's going to 
                         win this war: the old or the new 
                         Army?]]

               A little pause. CLIVE stays where he is. The sound of the 
               band and the rumble of the machines is very close. The morning 
               wind makes little waves on the tank. Suddenly CLIVE smiles.

                                     [BARBARA'S VOICE
                         ... promise to stay just as you are

                              (Slowly)
                         Now here is the lake - and I still 
                         haven't changed...
                              (He shakes his head, 
                              his smile grows 
                              broader)
                         ... Hopeless!

                                     [JOHNNY
                         Sir?]

               The music blares out.

               Somewhere close by the New Army is passing[[: tanks, guns, 
               trucks, men, fast-moving... hard-hitting]].

               Pan from JOHNNY to THEO and finally CLIVE, who salutes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:
