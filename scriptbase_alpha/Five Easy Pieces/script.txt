          Five Easy Pieces

          By

          Carole Eastman

          TITLE SEQUENCE:
          
          The Bach-Vivaldi A-Minor Concerto for Four Pianos
          PLAYS OVER a series of family album photographs.
          Written in careful penmanship beneath each are
          names identifying family members:
          
          1ST PHOTO: A man stands in front of the raised
          sounding board of a piano, playing the viola.
          Seated on the piano bench, accompanying him, is a
          woman in a maternity dress: 
          
          "Isabelle and Nicholas"
          
          2ND PHOTO: A boy of 11, wearing conductor's tails
          and holding a raised baton in his right hand as if
          about to gesture a downbeat:
          
          "Herbert Kreutzer Dupea"
          
          3RD PHOTO: Another boy of approximately 9, in the
          act of playing the violin:
          
          "Carl Fidelio Dupea"
          
          4TH PHOTO: The two boys are now poised behind the
          piano. Seated on its bench is a girl of 6, her
          hands resting on the keyboard. Written beneath:
          
          "Elizabeth Partita Dupea"
          
          5TH PHOTO: The above family group, seated on the
          porch of the Dupea home. All eyes but Isabelle's
          are faced toward the camera. She beams upon a 3
          year-old asleep in her arms, his head resting
          against her bosom. His figure is encircled by the
          pen's marking and preceding his name is the
          configuration of a small heart:
          
          "Robert Eroica Dupea"
          
          INT. MUSIC ROOM - DUPEA HOME - DAY
          
          BACH-VIVALDI OVER: 
          
          A 7-year-old BOBBY sits in a chair, his feet
          dangling in absent-minded rhythm to a chamber piece
          played by his father, his two brothers and his
          sister. 
          
          CLOSE ON a metronome, marking a slow etude rhythm. 
          
          The CAMERA MOVES from it to Bobby, on the piano
          bench beside his mother. As she patiently
          demonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb
          in his mouth and leans against her arm. 
          
          ON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and
          TITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side
          on the piano bench, playing four-hands with
          dazzling virtuosity. 
          
          The CAMERA MOVES from them to a framed newspaper
          article on the music-room wall. Below a photograph
          of a 20-year-old young man are the words: "Herbert
          Kreutzer Dupea - Seattle's Youngest Guest
          Conductor."
          
          INT. RECITAL HALL GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
          
          BACH-VIVALDI OVER:
          
          Bobby, at 10, wearing a dress suit. His mother
          combs his hair with maternal concentration.
          
          CLOSE-UP of a program announcing a Dupea family
          recital. The CAMERA SCANS down the bill, over:
          
          Sonata in C Major for Two Violins - Bach - Played
          by Nicholas and Carl Dupea. 
          
          Like As a Lovelorn Turtle - Hendel - Sung by
          Isabelle Dupea. 
          
          Rondo Alla Turca - Mozart - Played by Elizabeth
          Dupea. 
          
          Piano Sonata, Opus 110 - Beethoven - Played by
          Herbart Dupea. 
          
          The CAMERA COMES to rest on:
          
          Five Easy Pieces - Grebner - Played by Robert
          Dupea. 
          
          INT. MORTUARY CHAPEL - DAY
          
          Five Easy Pieces, played haltingly OVER the torsos
          of a line of people moving slowly down the chapel
          aisle. 
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE 
          
          shows a solemn procession of the above, filing by
          an open casket holding Isabelle Dupea.
          
          ON THE FAMILY PEW
          
          The CAMERA PANS from NICHOLAS, seated on the aisle,
          to the four adult children seated next to him and
          COMES TO REST on Bobby. His gaze is cast down to
          his lap, as he refuses to look at:
          
          The pale profile of his mother's face resting
          within the satin folds of the casket lining, and...
          
          ... as the last of the "family friends" pay their
          respect: Nicholas steps out into the aisle and,
          followed by Tita, Carl and HERBERT, moves down
          toward the casket.  
          
          Bobby rises from his seat and makes his way toward
          the aisle, where he hesitates briefly, then turns
          and walks up the aisle and out the chapel doors. 
          
          TITLES END
          
          EXT. SIGNAL HILL OIL FIELD - DAY
          
          TAMMY WYNETTE'S "STAND BY YOUR MAN" OVER:
          
          The toothed bucket of a back hoe trenches into the
          earth, then lifts up into the air, revealing Bobby
          in hard-hat and heavy gloves, operating the levers.
          As the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a
          load of earth into the rear of a truck...
          
          ... a SERIES OF SHOTS begins, showing Bobby and a
          fellow hard-hat (ELTON) engaged in the dirty and
          dangerous task of working "crew" with a team of
          TOOL-PUSHERS on the derricks of Signal Hill.
          Functioning as servants of the well and its pumps,
          the PULL rods, MAKE and BREAK joints on the rig
          floor, WELD tubing, CARRY pipes, CLIMB the "tour,"
          and PLAY THE DOZENS on beer wagon breaks. 
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - SIGNAL HILL - NIGHT
          
          ABOVE SONG OVER:
          
          Bobby, still in his hard hat, as he drives. Out
          through the window, the derricks of the Hill can be
          seen, their night-work lights on. 
          
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          SONG OVER:
          
          FOLLOWING ON the car as it moves off the Hill into
          the seamy districts adjacent to it, passing by fast
          food joints, liquor stores, all-night porno parlors
          and neon-lighted bars. 
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          SONG OVER:
          
          ON BOBBY'S FACE:
          
          as he stares out through the windshield, his eyes
          distant, dwelling in an oblivion that blanks both
          the present and past. 
          
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          SONG OVER:
          
          The car pulls onto a low-rent residential street
          and comes to a stop in front of a small bungalow.
          
          Bobby exits the car, moves up the walkway to the
          house and disappears inside. 
          
          INT. RAYETTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          SONG OVER:
          
          Bobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand,
          staring morosely across the room, to:
          
          A PORTABLE STEREO,
          
          playing the song:
          
                         WYNETTE (V.O.)
               "And if you love him/Oh be proud of
               him/For after all, he's just a
               man..."
          
          RAYETTE DIPESTO,
          
          in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts.
          After placing them on the coffee table in front of
          him, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a
          less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more
          fervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to
          his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.  
          
                         WYNETTE (V.O.)
               "Stand by your man/And show the
               world you love him/Keep giving all
               the love you can/Stand by your
               man."
          
          The song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for
          the moment:
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (Arky accent)
               I'm gonna play it again...
          
          As she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her
          hand. 
          
                         BOBBY
               You're not going to play it again.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, lemme play the other side
               then.
          
                         BOBBY
               No.
          
          Again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo
          and pulls her down onto the couch.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Now quit, Bobby. You said you're
               goin' a help me pick a song. 
          
                         BOBBY
               You said.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, lemme sing the one I picked
               an' see what you think...
                    (she sings)
               "When there's a fire in your
               heart/Break the glass/Sound the
               alarm..."
          
          He picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it
          over his ear. 
          
                         RAYETTE
               Oh, you prick...
          
          She pulls it from his hand.
          
                         RAYETTE
               How 'bout if I just cut off your
               damn water?
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm too moved by your gentility to
               speak. 
          
          She immediately softens and tries to become more
          "refined."
          
                         RAYETTE
               Sugar, you know how I feel about
               you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to
               get you to take an interest in my
               kind a things, an' what I'm tryin'
               to do with myself...
                    (bringing her face close
                    to his)
               You know, there id'n anything in
               the world I wouldn't do for you,
               baby. I started livin' the day I
               found you, you know that?
          
                         BOBBY
               You're playing the other side.
          
          Very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He
          finishes the beer and holds the can out to her. 
          
                         BOBBY
               Cerveza.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (grabbing it from him)
               Serveza yourself!
          
                         BOBBY
               Now, now.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (she stands up)
               No, dammit, I would easy.
          
          And, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:
          
                         BOBBY
               But you heal fast.
          
          Through the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can
          be seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a
          can of beer and returns to Bobby. 
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (over the above)
               You can play the piano, an' your
               whole damn family can play on some
               type a musical instrument. An' all
               I'm askin' is for you to listen to
               my singing for one single little
               second...
          
          She hands him the can and sits back down on the
          couch.
          
                         RAYETTE
               But you think you would? No, you're
               too damn selfish...
          
          He gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as
          we'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky
          accent he's learned from working the rigs:
          
                         BOBBY
               Why'nt you take 'at sign off your
               tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Out where?
          
          She sits down and begins removing the tag.
          
                         BOBBY
               I don't know, I'll holler up Elton
               an' Stoney...
          
          She thinks about it, then moves closer to him and
          begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'll go out with you, or I'll stay
               here, and do anything you'd like
               for me to do... if you'll just do
               one thing. If you'll tell me that
               you love me.
          
                         BOBBY
               You can sing the song.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (annoyed)
               You know what, you are never
               satisfied.
          
                         BOBBY
               That's right, hand.
          
          The response makes her deeply insecure and she
          immediately lays her body against his...
          
                         RAYETTE
               Oh, now, baby...
          
          ... and initiates another round of kissing.
          
          INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
          
          Bobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to
          the lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self
          congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back
          to:
          
          Elton, seated at the scoring table. His wife,
          STONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe
          banquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that
          Elton's two front teeth are missing.
          
                         ELTON
                    (Okie accent)
               Your ball, Ray.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (reluctant)
               Is this suppose to be fun?
          
                         BOBBY
               Go on, get up there...
          
          She rises and moves to the rack.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               ... and stay relaxed this time.
          
          Picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane
          and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully
          as...
          
          ... it rolls off to the right and takes only one
          pin.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          as she moves to her second ball.
          
                         BOBBY
               Now don't loft it, just release it
               like I told you.
          
          ON RAYETTE
          
          as she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and
          comes back to the banquette, apologizing:
          
                         RAYETTE
               The ball's too heavy for me,
               honey...
          
          He looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her
          ball.
          
                         BOBBY
               It's not the damn ball.
          
          And as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'm tryin', baby, so don't start
               gettin' mad now.
          
                         BOBBY
               No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll
               be all right. Just spot and follow
               through...
          
          And as Elton bowls a strike...
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
                    (mumbling)
               Shit.
          
          He gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Nice ball, El.
          
          Rayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to
          bowl:
          
                         RAYETTE
               Id'n he somethin' to see?
          
          And as he makes another strike and returns to the
          banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around
          him. He returns her embrace, smiling over her
          shoulder at:
          
          Two heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY)
          taking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that
          Betty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is
          Amazonian.)
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Is it my turn again?
          
                         BOBBY
               Right. Now show me a little
               somethin' this time, okay? Give me
               some form...
          
          He remains standing, watching as she throws another
          gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi
          ing:
          
                         RAYETTE
               I can't help it, honey, the ball
               just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on
               me...
          
                         BOBBY
               Will you just do what the hell I
               tell you...
          
                         RAYETTE
               I did, didn' I, El?
          
                         BOBBY
               You got another ball comin'.
          
          She moves to the rack and, concentrating hard,
          advances down the lane and releases the ball. It
          rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the
          right spot and clears the pins.
          
                         ELTON
               Atta boy, Ray!
          
          Ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating
          herself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a
          response from him.
          
                         RAYETTE
               That was damn good, wad'n it? I
               finally did it...
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, great.
                    (begins removing his
                    bowling shoes)
               Why don't you throw Z's for 19
               frames, and then roll a strike on
               the last ball in the last frame of
               a losing game? Just wonderful.
          
          Turning to address the two young women over the
          back of the banquette.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Wasn't it, ladies?
          
                         TWINKY
                    (pointing at herself)
               Are you talking to us?
          
          Rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them
          to the floor.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'm gonna go wait in the car.
          
          He stretches his arms out on the back of the
          banquette as though he intends to reside there
          awhile.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, why don't you do that.
          
          She grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she
          gets up:
          
                         STONEY
               Wait an I'll I go with you,
               honey...
          
          As she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:
          
                         ELTON
                    (changing his shoes)
               We gotta get on home an' relieve
               the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come
               on over.
          
                         BOBBY
               Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for
               the beers...
                    (hands him the bowling
                    shoes)
               An' walk Rayette over with you,
               will you.
          
          Elton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse,
          slumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty
          and Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion
          concerning him.
          
          A WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to
          him.
          
                         WAITRESS
               Can I get you anything else?
          
                         BOBBY
               No. How much do I owe you?
          
                         WAITRESS
               Five'll do it.
          
          He takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays
          them on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As
          he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots,
          Twinky approaches behind him and leans down over
          the back of the banquette.
          
                         TWINKY
               We been wantin' to ask you
               something. Are you the guy on YV?
          
                         BOBBY
               Am I on TV?
          
                         TWINKY
                    (pointing lo Betty)
               She says you're the one that sells
               all the cars on TV.
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, I don't claim to have sold
               'em all. They still have some left,
               I believe.
          
          Betty appears on the other side of the banquette.
          
                         BETTY
               See, I told you it was him...
                    (then to Bobby)
               Your name's Donnie something,
               right?
          
                         BOBBY
               I leave it to you.
          
                         BETTY
               My name is Shirley, but they call
               me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (looking to Twinky)
               Twinky?
          
                         BETTY
                    (explaining)
               Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (looking from one to the
                    other)
               Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is
               nice talking to you girls. I just
               wish I had more time...
          
                         BETTY
               That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
          
                         BOBBY
                    (touching his hair)
               A wig?
          
                         BETTY
               Yeah, I told her it was you, but
               that you're wearing a wig, 'cause
               on TV you're mostly bald in the
               front.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (to Twinky)
               Your little friend's real sharp
               there...
                    (to Betty)
               Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig
               on TV, because with two and a half
               million people watching you, you've
               gotta be sincere. I just like to
               wear it when I'm out slippin'
               around bowling alleys an' things
               like that. I think it gives me a
               little more class, don't you?
          
                         TWINKY
               Oh, definitely...
          
                         BETTY
                    (looking at his hairline)
               Yeah, but I can see a little bitty
               of the net up there, that's what
               give it away.
          
                         TWINKY
               It's so weird to see you in person,
               but that's who she says you are.
          
                         BETTY
                    (to her)
               It is him, he said it's him.
                    (to Bobby)
               Aren't you.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, you could say it's me.
          
          Twinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking
          up a pencil and a score sheet.
          
                         TWINKY
               I'm gonna give you our number,
               Donnie, just in case...
                    (as she writes)
               We're both professionals, if you
               didn't guess.
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, you seem very professional...
          
                         TWINKY
                    (handing the score sheet
                    to him)
               I always tell everyone the same
               thing. I got rolled and beat up
               real bad recently, and since then
               it's two for one, an' I work
               strictly in tandem with Betty...
          
          He glances at the dwarfish Betty.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, I can see how she'd come in
               handy.
          
          EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Rayette sits sulking in Bobby's car. He comes up to
          the passenger window and leans down to her.
          
                         BOBBY
               Come on. We're goin' over to
               Elton's.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'm not.
          
                         BOBBY
               You just going to sit there?
          
                         RAYETTE
               Yes.
          
                         BOBBY
               Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I hope they do.
          
          He casually slaps the outside of the door.
          
                         BOBBY
               See you later, then...
          
          He walks off through the lot.
          
          ON RAYETTE
          
          staring out through the windshield.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          as he stops and comes back to the car.
          
                         BOBBY
               No one would want to hit on you,
               you look too pathetic.
          
          No response.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Come on, DiPesto. We can still have
               a good time.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You're the pathetic one, not me.
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm going on over there...
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'm not some piece a crap.
          
                         BOBBY
               I know you're not.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You treat me like I was.
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm sorry.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (close to tears)
               You go slippin' around in front a
               my face, an' in front a Elton an'
               Stoney. What do you imagine they
               think a someone you treat that
               way...
          
                         BOBBY
               Now, hand...
          
          He opens the door and gets inside, putting his arm
          around her.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Elton and Stoney know how I feel
               about you. An' they're just goin'
               to think I'm not too nice a guy,
               which I'm not, an' that you're a
               hell of a person puttin' up with
               me, that's all.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You're goin' a find me dead one
               time.
          
                         BOBBY
               Sssh, come on now...
                    (he kisses her)
               Be a good girl.
          
                         RAYETTE
               If you really want a get up an'
               leave me, you can read about it in
               the newsprint.
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm not going to get up an' leave
               you.
                    (kisses her again, then:)
               Now let's go over to El's an' have
               a good time.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Do you love me, Bobby?
          
          He hesitates briefly, then:
          
                         BOBBY
               Well now, what do you think?
          
          Though hardly an undying declaration, it's close
          enough to fill her with forgiveness. Reaching over,
          she pulls him into her arms.
          
          EXT. SIGNAL HILL DERRICK - DAY
          
          KALEIDOSCOPIC SERIES OF SCENES, showing Elton and
          Bobby WORKING THE RIG as part of a four-man team.
          The DRILLER stands back, giving them directives,
          while the prestigious DERRICKMAN, the "star" of the
          team, lounges around in the b.g. Though he has been
          working the fields for some months, it is apparent
          that Bobby is still somewhat of a novice in the
          operations of the rig.
          
          FADE OVER ABOVE ACTIONS, to:
          
          INT. SIGNAL HILL DOGHOUSE - DAY
          
          An impromptu card game, taking place on a lunch
          break.
          
          (IMPROVISED) Bobby, in a buoyant mood, lays down a
          winning poker hand and rakes in a pile of bills and
          change lying on the table. The participants include
          Elton and THREE OTHER TOOLPUSHERS. In the b.g., as
          the game continues, other "HANDS" can be seen
          changing clothes.
          
          INT. TWINKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Bobby sits morosely on the couch beside Twinky. One
          of his arms is around her, the other holds a can of
          beer. Both he and Twinky are looking at...
          
          ... Elton, who rides Betty on his leg as both sing
          "Ride a Cockhorse To Banbury Cross." She begins to
          laugh with the hysterical abandon of a child, and
          Elton, nearly beside himself, looks over to Bobby.
          
                         ELTON
               God, id'n she the cutest damn thing
               in your life!
          
          EXT. SIGNAL HILL FIELD - DAY
          
          (ELTON SINGING A RANK DOGHOUSE SONG OVER:)
          
          REMOTE ANGLE ON BOBBY AND ELTON
          
          Having been up all night, drinking, they move
          unsteadily toward a derrick and are intercepted by
          the driller as they climb the stairs to the rig
          floor. He informs them they are unfit to work and
          "impolitely" eighty-sixes them for the day.
          
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          (ELTON SINGING OVER:)
          
          Bobby's car slows as it moves into a freeway jam.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          He gestures out at the traffic as Elton, strumming
          a ukelele, concludes his song.
          
                         BOBBY
               Can you believe this shit?
          
          He takes a drink from a half pint of bard liquor,
          then angrily hits at the steering wheel.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Goddamned freeway... Jesus
               Christ...
          
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
          
          A few cars ahead, a truck can be seen carrying
          several furniture pieces protected by padded
          covers.
          
                         ELTON
               Give 'em the horn, Bob.
          
                         BOBBY
               Look at these assholes! What the
               hell are they doing?!
          
          EXT. FREEWAY JAM - DAY
          
          The assholes are going nowhere and other cars close
          up behind and to both sides of Bobby's car.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          He suddenly throws the car into "park"...
          
                         BOBBY
               I can't take this shit anymore.
          
          ... opens the door and gets out.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          moving down the freeway, away from his car. Behind,
          Elton can be seen sliding over into the driver's
          seat.
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          as Bobby steps up onto the fender of a car, looking
          for the cause of the jam.
          
                         DRIVER
               Hey, get off my car!
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          ON ELTON
          
                         ELTON
               Where the hell's he goin'?
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
          
          Bobby cuts in front of another car and climbs up
          into the rear of the truck. Moving to the front of
          it, he looks out over the cab.
          
          POV of the glut of cars in all four lanes.
          
                         ELTON
               Hey, Bob! Come on! Quit foolin'
               around!
          
          EXT. TRUCK - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          On his way out of the truck, Bobby pauses to look
          beneath one of the padded protectors, then pulls it
          off to reveal an upright piano. He leans down to
          the keyboard and plays a few notes.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          Elton, amused.
          
                         ELTON
               Shit, what's he doin'?
          
          EXT. TRUCK - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          Bobby has pulled the bench out from beneath the
          piano and, sitting himself, begins to play a Chopin
          prelude.
          
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
          
          Elton can be seen applauding him.
          
          EXT. TRUCK - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          playing as the traffic begins to move and the truck
          with it.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          Again, Elton leans out the window, yelling at him:
          
                         ELTON
               You better get your butt off there,
               Bob! Come on, now!!
          
          EXT. TRUCK - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          The right-turn indicator is flashing and the truck
          begins to work its way across the lanes.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
          
          ELTON'S POV
          
          of Bobby playing, as the truck heads for an off
          ramp.
          
          ON ELTON
          
          honking the horn and flailing his arm out the
          window as he tries to cross lanes. The traffic
          closes on his right, preventing him from following.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
          
          ANGLE INCLUSIVE OF ELTON
          
          hemmed into the left-hand lanes, and the truck,
          with Bobby still playing, pulling away on the off
          ramp.
          
          EXT. TRUCK - LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY
          
          (CHOPIN PRELUDE OVER:)
          
          The truck slows and comes to a stop at a signal.
          Bobby jumps out and moves to the sidewalk.
          
          FOLLOWING with him as he wanders, boozed and
          aimless, along the dispirited cheap streets of the
          city.
          
          INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Rayette clears some plates from an empty table and,
          crossing the diner, sees...
          
          ... Bobby entering. As he takes a seat at the
          counter, she goes about her tasks, ignoring him.
          
          He watches her as she moves to the only other
          customer and totals his bill.
          
          Another waitress appears with a coffee Silex. She
          gestures it at Bobby and he nods. As she pours him
          a cup, Rayette moves to the register, deposits some
          bills, then turns and exits to the kitchen.
          
          EXT. REAR OF DINER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Bobby leans against a pickup adjacent to Rayette's
          car.
          
          She comes out of the rear door of the diner,
          hesitates as she sees him, then moves past him to
          her car.
          
                         BOBBY
               I was with Elton last night, Ray.
          
          Maintaining her attitude of suffered injustice, she
          reaches to the car door and opens it.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               It's the truth.
          
          He reaches behind her and pushes the door shut.
          Then gently taking hold of her arm, he turns her
          toward him, bringing his face close to hers...
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Rayette...
          
          ... and as she turns away, be begins to kiss her
          neck. She lowers her gaze to the ground, quietly
          uttering:
          
                         RAYETTE
               You son of a bitch.
          
          INT. ELTON AND STONEY'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bobby, Elton and Stoney are seated on the couch,
          all looking toward the TV, playing an old black-and
          white.
          Rayette is seated on an adjacent chair, holding an
          infant in her lap, cooing and fawning over it
          throughout the following.
          
                         ELTON
               I swore to God I'd never hire on to
               this type a work again. Christ, I
               don't know how the hell I let you
               talk me into it...
          
          Rayette reaches over to Bobby.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Give me a swig, hon'.
          
          He hands her his beer and as she takes a sip and
          hands it back:
          
                         ELTON
               You didn' know I was a derrickman
               once, did you?
          
          Bobby shakes his head.
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               Down in the southern fields, an'
               man, did I hate it. An' Stoney's
               brother was a well-puller, wad'n
               he, honey? The one with three
               fingers?
          
                         STONEY
                    (her eyes on the TV)
               My brother Cruser, yeah...
          
                         ELTON
               I once hung suspendered 90 feet up
               on a tour, like a damn circus
               artist...
          
                         RAYETTE
               Honey, took at this little bugger.
          
                         ELTON
               Near broke my damn neck...
          
                         RAYETTE
               Id'n he the cutest little guy?
          
                         BOBBY
               Very cute... Put it down, an' let's
               go.
          
          Elton turns to him with a gap-toothed smile:
          
                         ELTON
               You know, you oughta get you one
               them things, Bob.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          as he stands up...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (standing up)
               Yeah...
                    (stretching his arms)
               An' I oughta live in a trailer park
               with my front teeth poked out...
          
          EXT. SIGNAL HILL RIG - DAY
          
          ON ELTON
          
          seated on the rig floor opposite Bobby, who eats a
          sandwich, as:
          
                         ELTON
               Well, what if she was, Bob? I can't
               see nothin' so bad in it...
          
          Bobby scowls hostilely at him.
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               What if I was to let you in on the
               little fact that she is.
          
          He looks away from Elton, not wanting to hear.
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               That's right. She told me. An'
               she's all tore up about it, which I
               hate a see.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          as he continues:
          
                         ELTON
               Hell, id'n it just somethin' to
               face up to? I'll tell you,
               somewhere along the line, you even
               get to likin' the whole idea...
          
          ON ELTON
          
                         ELTON
               I recall when Stoney first give me
               the news, I could a shit...
          
          Bobby throws his sandwich onto the rig floor near
          Elton's leg. He looks down at a spatter of
          mayonnaise on his pants.
          
                         ELTON
               Well, id'n that nice.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (attacking the messenger)
               It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here,
               listening to some asshole cracker
               compare his life to mine!
          
          He spills out the remainder of coffee from his cup
          and screws it onto the top of a thermos.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Just keep telling me about the good
               life, Elton, if you want a see me
               puke my lunch!
          
          Elton reaches down and wipes the mayonnaise off his
          pant leg.
          
                         ELTON
               If you're sayin' you're somethin'
               better'n what I am, that's one
               thing. But I can't say much a
               someone who'd run off an' leave a
               woman in a situation like this an'
               feel easy about it. An' that's all
               I gotta say.
          
                         BOBBY
               I hope that's all you gotta say,
               El, 'cause I'm about as tired of
               your mouth as I am workin' this
               stinkin' hole!
          
          He grabs his jacket and his lunch bucket, jumps
          down off the rig and begins walking toward his car
          parked by the Field Office.
          
          In the b.g., Elton gets up and hurls his hard hat
          toward Bobby.
          
                         ELTON
               Shit ass!!
          
          As he approaches his car, he looks toward the 
          Field Office, where...
          
          ... The driller is leaning down to a car with TWO
          MEN in it.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          calling over to him:
          
                         BOBBY
               Hey, Longcipher! I'm quitting!
          
          The driller gestures a direction to the driver of
          the car, and as it pulls off, he moves toward the
          office:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Longcipher! I'm talking to you!
          
          The driller opens the office door and looks back to
          Bobby.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Did you hear me?! I said I'm
               quitting!
          
                         DRILLER
               I don't give a shit what you do.
               You ben more trouble than you're
               worth, an' I'm damn glad to be rid
               of both a you assholes.
          
          He goes into the office and closes the door.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          throwing his jacket and his lunch bucket into his
          car. As he starts to get in, his attention is drawn
          back to the rig.
          
          POV:
          
          The car that held the two men is parked next to it,
          and both men are on the rig platform moving toward
          Elton. He backs away from them, breaks toward the
          rig tour and starts to climb it. One of the men
          catches hold of his leg and yanks him back. Elton
          pulls loose from him, jumps to the ground and
          begins running with both men in pursuit.
          
                         BOBBY
               Hey! What's goin' on?!
          
          He starts sprinting back to the rig.
          
          The first man has a hold on Elton and is struggling
          to subdue him. He is joined by the second man, and
          as they force his arms behind his back and cuff his
          wrists...
          
          ... Bobby MOVES INTO FRAME, grabbing onto the first
          man and wrestling him away from Elton.
          
                         ELTON
               Don't do that, Bob!! It's the Law!
          
          Bobby hurls the man onto the ground and turns
          around to go after the second man, struggling with
          Elton.
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               It's the Law, Bob, don't mix in!
          
          The second man pushes Elton aside and as Bobby
          throws a punch at him...
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               Look out behind!
          
          ... the other grabs him from behind, holding him,
          while the second man jams a fist into his stomach
          and, as he doubles over, follows with a violent
          chop to the back of his neck.
          
          Bobby slumps to the ground, and as the first man
          puts a knee into his back and prepares to handcuff
          him:
          
                         ELTON (CONT'D)
               Hey, don't do that. Don't you think
               you could just leave him...
          
          The second man takes hold of Elton and starts to
          move him off.
          
                         ELTON
               Sure as hell he wouldn' a done that
               if he'd known who you was... Would
               you, Bob?
          
          Bobby, dazed, raises his head from the dirt,
          looking toward Elton.
          
                         BOBBY
               Christ Almighty, what's happening
               here?
          
                         SECOND MAN
               Okay, let him go.
          
          As he starts pushing a resistant Elton toward the
          car, Bobby sits up.
          
                         BOBBY
               Tell me what in the hell's going
               on, Elton!
          
                         ELTON
               I got accused a robbin' a
               fillin'station down in the Indian
               Nation, didn' I tell you...
          
                         SECOND MAN
               Come on.
          
                         ELTON
               I got wild an' jumped my bail...
          
                         SECOND MAN
               Move it!
          
          He takes him roughly by the arm and moves off with
          the first man following.
          
                         ELTON
                    (over his shoulder, to
                    Bobby)
               An' here they come runnin' after me
               a year later... Ain't that
               somethin'?
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          looking toward:
          
          The two men forcing Elton into the rear seat of the
          car, as he calls back to Bobby:
          
                         ELTON
               Tell Stoney for me, will you?! Tell
               her to come get me...
          
          They close the door on him and get into the car. As
          it drives off...
          
          Bobby sits watching until it disappears from sight,
          then he sits back against a pump casing and drops
          his head onto his chest.
          
          INT. TWINKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON TWINKY'S FACE
          
          She opens her mouth and rends the air with a
          keening wail. Her face beads with moisture and
          journeys through expressions indistinguishable from
          grief and anguish. Presently, an ecstatic and very
          professional screech issues from her, after which
          she reaches up and pulls Bobby down onto her,
          breathing into his ear...
          
                         TWINKY
               Donnie, oh Donnie...
          
          INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
          
          (BACH PARTITA FAINTLY UNDER:)
          
          Bobby, dressed in a suit and tie, moves through a
          network of hallways, checking the door numbers.
          
          He arrives at a door designated as Studio A, and,
          after hesitating for a moment, opens it and steps
          inside.
          
          INT. STUDIO A RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
          
          (BACH PARTITA UNDER:)
          
          TWO RECORDING ENGINEERS glance at him without
          interest and return to their dials and needles.
          
          Bobby looks from them through the glass partition
          to the recording studio in view beyond.
          
          POV:
          
          ELIZABETH "TITA" DUPEA is at the piano, intensely
          into the Bach. She wears a monastic-looking dress,
          her unruly hair is pinned back from her face, and
          her glasses lie on the bench beside her.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          watching her with both affection and appreciation.
          
          ON TITA
          
          She is "sounding" as she plays, in tones out-of-key
          and discordant with the Bach.
          
                         FIRST ENGINEER
               There she goes again.
          
          Bobby glances over at him, then looks back to Tita.
          
          POV:
          
          She hunches over the keyboard and plays an
          arpeggio, humming a long monochromatic note.
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               My 1-year-old can carry a tune
               better than that.
          
          Bobby is about to defend her, when the engineer
          flips a toggle switch and addresses the mike
          feeding into the studio:
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER (CONT'D)
               Miss Dupea.
          
          There is no response and she continues playing.
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER (CONT'D)
                    (more emphatic)
               Miss Dupea.
          
                         TITA
                    (annoyed)
               Yes.
          
          Bobby can be seen in the b.g., having difficulty
          restraining his irritation under the following:
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               I'd like to remind you again, this
               isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
          
                         TITA
               Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing
               again?
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               If you want to call it that.
          
                         TITA
               Well, you have to simply tell me,
               that's all.
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               That's exactly what I am doing,
               again.
          
                         TITA
               Do you have to let me get halfway
               through the movement first? This is
               tiring me.
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               I have a suggestion. Why don't we
               take a break.
          
                         TITA
               Oh, for pity's sake...
          
          She puts her elbows on top of the piano and drops
          her head into her bands.
          
                         FIRST ENGINEER
               Is she going to cry again?
          
                         TITA
               I don't want to take a break.
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
               What would you like in your coffee?
          
          She makes a mumbled response, her head still in her
          bands:
          
                         TITA
               Tea.
          
                         BOBBY
               Would you tell her Bobby's here?
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER
                    (to the mike)
               Miss Dupea, Bobby's here.
          
          She raises her head, squints toward the booth, then
          grabs her glasses from the bench and puts them on.
          
          INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
          
          Bobby enters the studio and comes toward her,
          opening his arms. She rushes into his embrace,
          burying her face in his shoulder.
          
                         TITA
                    (very emotional)
               Oh my goodness... Bobby...
          
                         BOBBY
               Hi, Tita.
          
          She raises her head to look at him, and verging on
          tears:
          
                         TITA
               Robert Eroica...
          
                         BOBBY
               Now don't...
          
                         TITA
               No, I'm not...
                    (taking a deep breath,
                    then:)
               I'm not.
          
                         BOBBY
               That's good.
          
          A NEW ANGLE
          
          Tita sits on the piano bench, crying and searching
          through her purse for a tissue. Bobby hovers behind
          her, gently patting her on the back and glancing
          with some embarrassment toward the recording booth.
          
                         TITA
               I just can't look at you.
          
                         BOBBY
               Don't, then.
          
          As she blows her nose into the tissue, a young man
          comes into view, hands Bobby a paper cup and
          leaves. Tita takes another tissue from her purse
          and dabs at her eyes.
          
                         TITA
               You always do this to me.
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, I don't mean to.
                    (setting the cup down on
                    the piano)
               Here's your tea, Tita.
          
                         TITA
               Thank you...
                    (then:)
               Oh no, don't put it on there...
          
          She quickly picks up the cup and places it on the
          floor.
          
                         BOBBY
               Sorry.
          
                         TITA
                    (caressing the piano)
               This is a very special, very old CB
               275...
          
                         BOBBY
               Oh.
          
                         TITA
               You know who it once belonged to?
          
                         BOBBY
               No.
          
                         TITA
               Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (politely)
               No kidding.
          
          He sits down on the bench beside her...
          
                         TITA
               It has absolutely no objectionable
               idiosyncrasies...
          
          ... and tests it out with a brief flourish on the
          keys. She watches him, then:
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               Robert...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (stops playing)
               Very nice.
          
                         TITA
               I have to talk seriously with
               you...

               Everybody still up on the Island?
          
                         TITA
               Well, Herbert's mostly on the
               mainland because of the orchestra,
               so at the moment, there's just
               Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van
               Oost.
          
                         BOBBY
               Who's Van Oost?
          
                         TITA
                    (not fond of the subject)
               Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's
               working with Carl.
          
                         BOBBY
               Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing
               coaching piano?
          
                         TITA
               Well, 11 months ago he was on his
               bicycle, on his way to the post
               office in La Roche... and he ran
               into a Jeep and sprained his
               neck...
          
          Bobby laughs.
          
                         BOBBY
               Sprained his neck?
          
          Tita laughs, then:
          
                         TITA
               It's not funny. He permanently
               sprained his neck, and since then
               it's been extremely difficult for
               him to tuck the violin.
          
                         BOBBY
               Crashes into a Jeep and totals his
               neck.
                    (shaking his head)
               That's Carl...
          
                         TITA
               Robert, I have to tell you
               something...
          
                         BOBBY
               What?
          
                         TITA
               Daddy's very ill.
          
                         BOBBY
               Oh, well, what, what's he...
          
                         TITA
               He's had two strokes.
          
          He looks away from her, not wanting to hear any
          more.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               He's not... They feel he... maybe
               he might not recover, and that
               he'll either...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (standing up)
               Don't tell me about this...
          
          He moves away from the piano and Tita turns to look
          at him.
          
                         TITA
               But don't you think it's right,
               though, that you should see him, at
               least once...
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE
                    (miked)
               We're ready Miss Dupea.
          
                         TITA
                    (to the booth)
               Just a minute, please!
                    (to Bobby)
               Robert, don't you think it's right
               that you should see him?
          
          He moves aimlessly about trying to subdue his
          anguish.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah... I guess so...
          
                         TITA
               I'm going back up tonight. Will you
               go with me?
          
                         BOBBY
               No...
          
          He glances at her, catching her profound
          disappointment.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'd rather drive up myself and...
               maybe go into Canada after... And I
               can't stay long, Tita, probably a
               week, at the most.
          
                         TITA
               I know.
          
          He looks toward the booth.
          
                         BOBBY
               Well...
                    (then, to Tita)
               I better let you...
          
                         TITA
               Wait...
          
          She gets up from the bench and goes to him, taking
          hold of his arm.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               I'll walk out with you...
          
          As they move to the hall door, she addresses the
          booth:
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               I'll be back in two minutes!
          
                         SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE
               Cut that in half, will you?
          
          She smiles at Bobby as they go out into hall.
          
                         TITA
               They hate me, I feel.
          
          FOLLOWING WITH THEM
          
          down the hallway.
          
                         BOBBY
               Maybe you better stay, then.
          
                         TITA
               No, I need to talk to you, about so
               many things...
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, I'll be seeing you in a
               couple of days, won't I?
          
          They stop at the stairway.
          
                         TITA
               Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that
               you're coming...
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, me, too...
          
                         TITA
               It'll be so good for you, and for
               Daddy, because you know, you've
               never really...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (cutting her off)
               Tita, I've got to go...
          
                         TITA
               All right...
          
          He kisses her.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               Okay.
          
          Feeling herself about to break down again, she
          attempts a valiant smile and stands watching as...
          
          ... Bobby turns and goes down the stairs.

          looking from...
          
          ... a rumpled blanket on the couch, to...
          
          ... a can of beer and a lighted cigarette burning
          in an ashtray on the coffee table.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (calling out)
               Hello?!
          
          He crosses to a hall and moves down toward the
          bedroom.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               You have the day off?!
          
          He steps into the doorway, to see:
          
          Rayette, lying in bed, her back against the
          pillows, staring at the wall.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Are you sick?
          
          No response.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               You heard about Elton, I guess.
          
          She turns her gaze to the window. He looks at her
          briefly, then:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Okay, I get your point.
          
          As he moves to the closet:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Hope you didn't strain yourself,
               getting in here and into your pose
               before I hit the door.
          
          He picks up a suitcase from the closet floor, grabs
          some of his clothes from the rack, and, moving to a
          chair, sets the suitcase on it and begins packing.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I have to go home. My father's
               sick.
          
          Rayette turns on her side, making a snorting sound
          of disbelief.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Yeah, it's very funny.
          
          He moves to a dresser, extracts his underwear and
          returns to the suitcase.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'll be gone two or three weeks.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (not looking at him)
               You'll be gone, period.
          
          He closes the suitecase, secures it...
          
                         BOBBY
               I'll try and call you from up
               there.
          
          ... and picking it up, moves around the bed toward
          the door. He stops, setting the suitcase on the bed
          and looking down at her.
          
          She is still faced away from him, her shoulders
          trembling as she weeps soundlessly.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
                    (very emotional)
               Come on, DiPesto. I never told you
               it would work out to anything. Did
               I?
          
          He looks away from her, to the window.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'll send you some money, that's
               all I can do.
          
          Returning his gaze to her:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               And... I'll call you, like I
               said...
                    (he pauses, then)
               Bye, Ray.
          
          An audible sob finally comes from her. Bobby
          quickly picks up the suitcase and moves out of the
          bedroom and down the hall.

          Bobby pulls off onto the right-hand shoulder, stops

          A long-haired young woman (PALM) in Levi's and
          parka, presently pushing her close-cropped, boyish
          looking friend (TERRY) against the side of the car
          and making some indecipherable accusation.
          
                         BOBBY
               Hey! What's going on, what's the
               trouble?!
          
          The young woman turns and gives him the finger.
          
                         PALM
               Rotate, mack!
          
          ON RAYETTE
          
          sticking her head out the driver's window.
          
                         RAYETTE
               What'd she say?
          
          ON PALM
          
          gesturing angrily back at the wreck as she crosses
          toward Bobby.
          
                         PALM
               Look at my car! Piece of shit! I
               just bought it brand new from a
               used-car lot, and the steering goes
               to the pot on me!
          
                         BOBBY
               You're lucky no one was hurt.
          
                         PALM
               Seven hundred dollars, down the
               toilet! I'd like to go back and
               punch the son of a bitch out! Can
               you give us a lift?
          
          Without waiting for a response, she moves back to
          Terry, who is retrieving some of their belongings
          from the highway.
          
                         PALM (CONT'D)
               Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
          
                         RAYETTE
               Jesus, what a rude person...
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - DAY
          
          Palm and Terry, still under the spell of their
          roadside tiff, sit in sulky silence in the back
          seat.
          
          Bobby glances at Palm in the rear view.
          
                         BOBBY
               What's your name?
          
                         PALM
               Palm Apodaca.
          
          Rayette turns around and, thinking Terry is a boy,
          asks rather flirtatiously:
          
                         RAYETTE
               An' what's your name?
          
                         TERRY
               Terry Grouse.
          
          Shocked at the female voice coming from "him," she
          turns back around and pokes Bobby on the leg.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (loudly)
               What?
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (low tones)
               I'll tell you...
                    (spelling out)
               ... l-a-t-e-r.
          
                         PALM
               How far are you going to?
          
                         BOBBY
               Washington.
          
                         PALM
               We'll get off in Washington and
               hook another ride.
          
                         BOBBY
               Where are you going?
          
                         PALM
               Alaska.
          
                         BOBBY
               Alaska? Are you on vacation?
          
                         TERRY
                    (sullenly)
               She wants to live there, because
               she thinks it's cleaner.
          
                         BOBBY
               Cleaner than what?
          
                         PALM
                    (to Terry)
               You don't have to tell everybody
               about it. Pretty soon they'll all
               go there and it won't be so clean.
          
                         BOBBY
               How do you know it's clean?
          
                         PALM
               I saw a picture of it. Alaska is
               very clean. It appeared to look
               very white to me... Don't you
               think?
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
          
          She leans forward, looking annoyed.
          
                         PALM
               Before the what?

          (COUNTRY & WESTERN INSTRUMENTAL OVER:)
          
          ON THE CAR
          
          moving through the Redwood country above San
          Francisco.

          ON BOBBY
          
          bored, as he drives. Beside him, Rayette primps in
          the sunvisor mirror.
          
          ON THE BACK SEAT
          
          Terry lights a cigarette while Palm, staring
          morosely out the window, goes into a soliloquy:
          
                         PALM
               I had to leave this place. I got
               depressed, seeing all the crap. And
               the thing is, they're making more
               crap, you know? They've got so many
               stores and stuff and junk full of
               crap, I can't believe it.
          
                         BOBBY
               Who?
          
                         PALM
               Who? People, that's who! Pretty
               soon there won't be room for
               anyone.
               They're selling more crap that
               people go and buy than you can
               imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe
               everybody should have a big hole
               where they throw in all this stuff
               and burn it.
          
          Rayette leans around to her.
          
                         RAYETTE
               There'd never be a hole big enough.
               Now took at me, for instance, when
               I was just one person, before
               Bobby, I had so much garbage
               collectin' onto me every day, I was
               thinkin' about gettin a dispose
               all...
          
                         PALM
               A dispose-all, what's that but more
               crap? I've never seen such crap.
               Oofh, I don't know how people get
               up in the morning.
          
                         TERRY
               Mass production is what does it.
          
                         PALM
               What do you mean "mass"... I have
               to come out and tell you, you're
               not that clean, either.
          
                         TERRY
               Wait a minute. I'm not that neat,
               maybe, but I am clean.
          
                         PALM
               Well, you're not that bad, but some
               people... I mean, people's homes,
               just filth. I've been in people's
               homes...
          
                         TERRY
               In my personal observation, I think
               that more people are neat than are
               clean...
          
                         PALM
               In my personal thing, I don't see
               that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot
               of filth. What they need to do
               every day, no, once in a while, is
               a cockroach thing, where they spray
               the homes. And uh...
               can you imagine, if their doors
               were painted a pretty color, and
               they had a pot outside, with...
          
                         TERRY
               Yeah, it could be adorable...
          
                         PALM
               And they picked up! I mean, it
               wouldn't be filthy, with Coke
               bottles and whiskey, and those
               signs everywhere...
          
          She gestures angrily out the window at the roadside
          billboards.
          
                         PALM (CONT'D)
               ... they oughta be erased! All
               those signs, selling crap, and more
               crap, and, I don't know, it's
               disgusting, I don't even want to
               talk about it!
          
          Bobby starts to say something:
          
                         BOBBY
               Well...
          
                         PALM
               It's just filthy. People are dirty.
               I think that's the biggest thing
               that's wrong with people. I think
               they wouldn't be as violent if they
               were clean, because then they
               wouldn't have anybody to pick on...
               Oofh... Dirt...
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well...
          
                         PALM
               Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's
               filth. Filth is bad. That's what
               starts maggots and riots...
          
          She suddenly leans over to the front seat, pointing
          to a semi ahead.
          
                         PALM (CONT'D)
               Hey, follow that truck. They know
               the best places to stop.
          
                         RAYETTE
               That's an old maid's tale.
          
                         PALM
               Bullshit! Truck drivers know the
               best eating places on the road.
          
          Rayette turns around, asserting:
          
                         RAYETTE
               Salesmen and cops are the ones. If
               you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd
               know.
          
                         PALM
               Don't call me "honey," mack.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Don't call me "mack," honey.
          
                         PALM
               I wouldn't be a waitress. They're
               nasty and full of crap.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You better hold onto your tongue!
          
                         PALM
                    (giving her the finger)
               Hold onto this.
          
          Terry laughs.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Just one minute, you! Don't you
               ever talk to me like that!
          
                         BOBBY
               Shut up! All of you!
          
          INT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY
          
          All four are seated at a booth. The women have
          given their orders and a WAITRESS stands above
          Bobby, waiting for his:
          
                         BOBBY
                    (looking at his menu)
               I'll have an omelette, no potatoes.
               Give me tomatoes instead, and wheat
               toast instead of rolls.
          
          The waitress indicates something on the menu with
          the butt of her pencil.
          
                         WAITRESS
               No substitutions.
          
                         BOBBY
               What does that mean? You don't have
               any tomatoes?
          
                         WAITRESS
                    (annoyed)
               No. We have tomatoes.
          
                         BOBBY
               But I can't have any. Is that what
               you mean?
          
                         WAITRESS
               Only what's on the menu...
                    (again, indicating  with
                    her pencil)
               A Number Two: Plain omelette. It
               comes with cottage fries and rolls.
          
                         BOBBY
               I know what it comes with, but
               that's not what I want.
          
                         WAITRESS
               I'll come back when you've made up
               your mind...
          
          She starts to move away and Bobby detains her.
          
                         BOBBY
               Wait, I've made up my mind. I want
               a plain omelette, forget the
               tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the
               plate, and give me a side of wheat
               toast and a cup of coffee.
          
                         WAITRESS
               I'm sorry, we don't have side
               orders of toast. I can give you an
               English muffin or a coffee roll.
          
                         BOBBY
               What do you mean, you don't have
               side orders of toast? You make
               sandwiches, don't you?
          
                         WAITRESS
               Would you like to talk to the
               manager?
          
                         PALM
               Hey, mack!
          
                         BOBBY
                    (to Palm)
               Shut up.
                    (to the waitress)
               You have bread, don't you, and a
               toaster of some kind?
          
                         WAITRESS
               I don't make the rules.
          
                         BOBBY
               Okay, I'll make it as easy for you
               as I can. Give me an omelette,
               plain, and a chicken salad sandwich
               on wheat toast -- no butter, no
               mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup
               of coffee.
          
          She begins writing down his order, repeating it
          sarcastically:
          
                         WAITRESS
               One Number Two, and a chicken sal
               san -- hold the butter, the mayo,
               the lettuce -- and a cup of
               coffee... Anything else?
          
                         BOBBY
               Now all you have to do is hold the
               chicken, bring me the toast, charge
               me for the sandwich, and you
               haven't broken any rules.
          
                         WAITRESS
                    (challenging him)
               You want me to hold the chicken.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah. I want you to hold it between
               your knees.
          
          The other three laugh, and the waitress points to a
          "Right to Refuse" sign above the counter.
          
                         WAITRESS
               You see that sign, sir?!
          
          Bobby glances over at it, then back to her.
          
                         WAITRESS (CONT'D)
               You'll all have to leave, I'm not
               taking any more of your smartness
               and your sarcasm!
          
          He smiles politely at her, then:
          
                         BOBBY
               You see this sign?
          
          He reaches his arm out and "clears" the table for
          her.

               Fantastic! That you could figure
               all that out, and lay that down on
               her, to come up with a way you
               could get your toast.
          
                         BOBBY
               I didn't get it, did I?

               No, but it was very clever... I

          Though no one listens, she goes on, working herself

               Right, steam. A car you could ride
               around in and not cause a stink.
               But do you know, they will not even
               let us have it. Can you believe it?
               Why?! Man! He likes to create a
               stink. I wrote them a note once,
               and told them to clean it... I
               mean, don't you see that? It's just
               filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you
               wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a

                         RAYETTE
               Are you depressed about your daddy,

          onto his side, faced away from her.
          
          They lie silently in the dark for a moment. Then:
          
                         RAYETTE

               If you just wouldn't open your

               Why can't I go out to your folks'

                         BOBBY
               I have to see how things are first.
               My father's sick, you understand?
               They wouldn't be prepared for me
               bringing anyone.
          
          He holds out a roll of bills and as she takes them:
          
                         RAYETTE
               So how long am I supposed to sit

          Bobby gets out of his car and wanders the deck of
          the ferry. He stops to look out over the Sound to
          one of the islands off the Washington coast, then
          glances back to the mainland, receding in the
          distance.

          The car moves over a tree-lined country lane and
          presently turns off onto a private road, leading to
          a large Victorian-style house. It pulls to a stop
          behind two other cars.
          
          Bobby gets out of the car and moves up the porch
          steps to the front door.
          
          CLOSER ON him as he hesitates, listening briefly to
          the FAINT SOUND of two pianos coming from within.

          Bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the
          house, taking in the ghosts of the past.
          
          In the living room, he pauses at a table to look at
          several framed photographs. He picks up one of his
          mother and father, looks closely at it, then gently
          returns it to its place and resumes wandering.
          
          He stops at the music room and looks in through the
          half-opened door:
          
          POV INTO MUSIC ROOM:
          
          On the far side of the room, near windows which
          give view to a verdant exterior, are two concert
          grands. His brother CARL is seated at one of the
          pianos, and a young woman (CATHERINE VAN OOST) is
          seated at the other.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          looking from Carl, to Catherine. He watches her
          briefly, then steps out of the doorway...
          
          ... and moves down a hallway to a closed door. He
          reaches down and opens it, looking inside to:
          
          TITA
          
          grooming the hair of an elderly man (NICHOLAS
          DUPEA) seated in a wheelchair with his back to
          Bobby.
          
          She looks up and, seeing Bobby, smiles happily,
          then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around.
          
          ON NICHOLAS
          
          His eyes are half-closed and are cast down to the
          floor.
          
          Bobby moves over to him, bending down and looking
          into his face. Nicholas opens his eyes slightly and
          gazes through Bobby into an absolute elsewhere.
          
          Bobby raises his eyes to Tita.
          
                         BOBBY

          fed his dinner by a male nurse (SPICER).
          
          Bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated
          next to Tita. Unable to bear looking at his father,
          he glances over at Catherine, seated next to Carl
          on his right.
          
          She raises her eyes from her plate to ask him
          something, just as Tita is moved to reminisce:
          
                         TITA
               Remember, Bobby, what mother used
               to say when...
          
                         CATHERINE
                    (to Bobby)
               How long have you been...
                    (To Tita)
               Oh, excuse me...
          
                         TITA
               No, it's all right, you go ahead...
          
                         CATHERINE
               I was just going to ask Robert how
               long he's been away from here.
          
                         BOBBY
               Four or five years.
          
                         CARL
               No, the last time was three years
               ago.
          
                         TITA
               Oh no, it's been much more than
               that.
          
                         CARL
               Away from the piano, Tita, you have
               no sense of time at all.
          
                         TITA
               I don't think that's true.
          
                         CARL
               It is true.
          
                         TITA
               Besides being very rude.
          
                         CATHERINE
               What have you been doing since
               then?
          
                         BOBBY
               What have I been doing? Different
               things, different jobs, here and
               there. Nothing that interesting.
          
                         CATHERINE
               And you no longer play at all?
          
          Bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by:
          
                         CARL
               You know, just after I came back
               off tour with the Betenthaller
               Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert
               had a summit conference about
               you...
          
                         TITA
               Oh, my, "a summit conference." I
               wonder where I was, polishing
               silver behind the coal bin.
          
                         CARL
               I don't know where you were, penis
               envy.
          
                         TITA
               I hope I didn't hear that.
          
                         CARL
               At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a
               private detective to ferret you
               out, and I said, "What for?"
               Whatever the hell he's doing, even
               if it's a completely wasteful
               escapade, it's entirely his
               business. Simple as that...
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
          
                         TITA
               I don't think you should infer
               Daddy was wrong in front of him...
          
          She looks at Spicer, pushing a spoon at Nicholas's
          closed mouth.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               Don't force him like that, Spicer.
          
          Spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his
          own dinner.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (to Catherine)
               How long have you been staying
               here?
          
                         TITA
               A couple of months.
          
          He starts to ask another question and is again
          overridden by:
          
                         CARL
               Did you hear about my misfortune,
               Robert?
          
                         BOBBY
               What?
          
                         CARL
               It's still nearly impossible for me
               to turn my neck. If I wanted to
               turn toward Catherine, for
               instance, I'd first have to twist
               the whole base of my body around...
                    (demonstrating)
               ... like this...
          
          Tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate,
          exits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself
          in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass,
          Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at
          him. She quickly alters her gaze to Carl.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I wouldn't mind doing a little
               work, if you're finished, and not
               too tired...
          
                         CARL
               No, I'm finished...
                    (placing a hand on his
                    stomach)
               Satiety is my father and mother.
          
          Finding he's amused himself and nobody else, he
          gets up and addresses Bobby.
          
                         CARL (CONT'D)
               She's tremendously gifted, this
               girl.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (looking at her)
               Is she?
          
          Catherine stands up and, wanting to change the
          subject:
          
                         CATHERINE
               Excuse me, I don't want to hear
               this...
          
          She exits and Carl, on his way out, pauses at
          Bobby's chair.
          
                         CARL
               I hope you feel at home, Robert.
                    (patting him on the
                    shoulder)
               I'm really glad you're here.
          
                         BOBBY
               Thanks, Carl...
          
          He looks down table to see Spicer stacking his
          plate onto Nicholas's and his eyes follow him as
          he, too, moves out of the dining room to the
          kitchen.
          
          CLOSE ON BOBBY
          
          in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his
          father. He looks down at his plate, poking at the
          remainder of his dinner, then braves a look down
          the table.
          
          ON NICHOLAS
          
          looking back at him, his eyes devoid of interest or
          cognition.
          
          EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
          
          Bobby and Tita walk away from the house down toward
          the ocean. Accompanying them is a Borzoi hound
          belonging to her.
          
                         TITA
               He has ways of communicating,
               Robert. I can tell when he's
               expressing approval or disapproval,
               just from his eyes...
          
                         BOBBY
               Uhm hmm. Some range.
          
                         TITA
               It's not that bad.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yes, it is. I can't take seeing
               him, sitting there like a stone.
          
                         TITA
               A week or two isn't going to ruin
               your life, for Godsakes.
          
          He doesn't respond.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               I mean, you think I'm that happy?
          
                         BOBBY
               No, I don't.
                    (a pause, then:)
               You should've left a long time ago.
          
                         TITA
               We can't all get up and leave, can
               we? I mean, there are certain needs
               you have to respond to...
          
          She stops walking and moves to one of the garden
          chairs, facing out toward the bay.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               And anyway, I want you to stay, so
               I can spend some time with you, and
               ask you some questions...
          
          He leans his back against a tree.
          
                         BOBBY
               What questions?
          
                         TITA
               Well, do you -- I mean, have you
               enjoyed all these... strange things
               you've been doing?
          
                         BOBBY
               Sometimes.
          
          She stares at him for a moment, and taking note of
          it:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Why? Am I some kind of freak to you
               or something?
          
                         TITA
               No, no, I don't think that, I'm
               just curious about it...
                    (a pause)
               Do you think I'm a freak?
          
                         BOBBY
               Sort of.
          
          She laughs.
          
                         TITA
               Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I
               look?
          
                         BOBBY
               No, I don't really think you're a
               freak.
          
                         TITA
               I probably am, but I don't care. I
               mean, I wasn't that blessed to
               begin with, and when would I have
               had time to make any
               improvements...
          
                         BOBBY
               What about Carl and Catherine? Is
               he just coaching her, or what?
          
                         TITA
               Constantly. Night and day. And
               unless I get up before the birds, I
               can't get in any practice time for
               myself...
          
                         BOBBY
               Uhm hmm.
          
                         TITA
               Actually, it's very admirable, the
               way she works. She'll probably be
               enormously successful, because
               she's attractive as well, not that
               that's so important in music,
               but...
          
                         BOBBY
               You're attractive, Tita. If you
               just did a little more with
               yourself...
          
                         TITA
               Like what?
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, if you just maybe did
               something with your hair, or...
          
                         TITA
               Oh, let's not talk about my hair,
               it does what it wants to, and
               anyway, who cares, I want to talk
               about you...
          
                         BOBBY
               There's nothing to say, Tita...
          
          He offers nothing further and looks out over the
          bay. Then, after a brief silence:
          
                         TITA
               Well, you're not going to run out
               on me right away, are you?
          
                         BOBBY
               I don't know.
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
          
          Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth,
          looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine.
          
          He moves to the music room and looks inside.
          
          THROUGH THE DOORWAY
          
          Catherine can be seen, seated at the piano. Carl
          stands above her and they engage in some exchange
          about the score resting on the piano's music stand.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          as he moves down the hallway and sees:
          
          Spicer descending the staircase, with the brittle
          Nicholas in his arms.
          
          He ducks into the nearest room to avoid them.
          
          INT. DEN - DUPEA HOME - DAY
          
          Tita, startled in the act of appraising herself in
          a mirror above the fireplace, turns around to
          Bobby:
          
                         TITA
               Oh God, don't sneak up on me like
               that!
          
          We see she wears a little make-up and has done
          something "different" with her hair.
          
                         BOBBY
               Sorry.
          
          He turns and exits the den.
          
          EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
          
          Bobby stands on the front porch, looking toward...
          
          ... Catherine coming up from the ocean. She wears a
          bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a
          towel, and as she approaches:
          
                         CATHERINE
               Hello...
          
                         BOBBY
               I guess you fell in the water.
          
                         CATHERINE
                    (amused)
               Yes, intentionally.
          
                         BOBBY
               That's dangerous, you know.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Swimming?
          
                         BOBBY
               Playing piano all day and then
               jumping into cold water. You could
               get a cramp.
          
          She laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner
          of the towel.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I love to swim, and I don't mind
               the cold at all. It's invigorating.
          
                         BOBBY
               Well, I wouldn't want to get too
               invigorated myself.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Why?
          
                         BOBBY
               What would I do with it? Run amok?
          
          She comes up the stairs.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Besides piano and swimming, what
               else do you do?
          
                         CATHERINE
               Well, there's fishing and boating.
               There's concerts on the mainland
               and... but I feel silly telling
               you. This is really your home. You
               probably know better than I what
               there is to do.
          
                         BOBBY
               Nothing.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Nothing? Then it must be very
               boring for you here.
          
                         BOBBY
               That's right. Have you anything to
               suggest?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I don't know. Let me give it some
               thought.
          
          She moves toward the front door, with Bobby
          following.
          
                         BOBBY
               What're you doing right now...
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
          
          Catherine comes inside and moves toward the
          stairway, with Bobby behind.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Right now I'm going to run a hot
               tub and soak myself.
          
                         BOBBY
               Then after that?
          
          She goes up a few steps and turns back to him.
          
                         CATHERINE
               After that, I plan to read some
               music and rest for awhile.
          
                         BOBBY
               Tomorrow, then.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Tomorrow's a full practice day...
                    (continues up the stairs)
               But the day after is kind of open.
          
          At the top of the stairs, she stops and looks down
          at him.
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (as if it were a year)
               The day after tomorrow.
          
                         CATHERINE
               If you're free.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, I'll probably be free.
          
          She turns and disappears into the second-floor
          hallway.
          
          INT. DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the
          table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is
          remote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas,
          and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he
          drinks from a bottle of beer.
          After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas
          and Tita quickly requests:
          
                         TITA
               Don't laugh...
          
          She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do
          Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate
               anything...
          
                         CARL
               I took some aspirin and it really
               upset my stomach.
          
          Catherine begins pouring the coffee.
          
                         CATHERINE
               One thing that's hard to understand
               is how you could have this
               incredible background in music, and
               then just walk away from it,
               without a second thought...
          
                         BOBBY
               I gave it a second thought.
          
          Tita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:
          
                         TITA
               He looks tired to me, Spicer. I
               think you should put him to bed.
          
          He nods, and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from
          the room:
          
                         CATHERINE
               I mean, how could you not play
               anymore? That's so strange to me...
          
                         BOBBY
               I have played a few times. Here and
               there. As a matter of fact, I was
               once a rehearsal pianist for a Las
               Vegas musical revue.
          
                         CATHERINE
               You don't call that music, though.
          
                         BOBBY
               Of course I do. It's music. You
               know...
          
          He places his hands on the table and simulates the
          playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper,
          simultaneously vocalizing as he does.
          
          Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces
          disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
          
                         CARL
               Robert, do you mind?
          
                         BOBBY
               What?
          
                         CARL
               Nothing. Will you excuse us for a
               while?
          
          He takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.
          
                         CATHERINE
               We really don't have to, Carl, if
               you're not feeling good...
          
                         CARL
                    (a bit martyred)
               Well, maybe if we put the
               Thermaphore on me for a while,
               first...
          
                         CATHERINE
               Oh, all right.
          
          And as they move to the door, she glances
          apologetically back at Bobby.
          
          Deflated and embarrassed, he looks away from Tita's
          sympathetic gaze. After a brief silence, she
          reaches to a platter on the table.
          
                         TITA
               Do you want some gingerbread?
          
                         BOBBY
                    (elsewhere)
               What?
          
                         TITA
               With applesauce?
          
                         BOBBY
               No, thanks...
          
          INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bobby stands in the living room. It is dark and the
          only light comes from some burning logs in the
          fireplace. He listens briefly to the sounds of a
          Beethoven sonata coming from the music room...
          
          ... then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and
          lies down, staring absently into the flames. After
          a moment, he closes his eyes.
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to FADE.
          
          INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - MORNING
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          still asleep in the chaise. He is suddenly jolted
          awake by a loud thud and sits up, looking out the
          window to:
          
          POV OF SPICER
          
          lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to
          it. He does a series of vigorous presses with it,
          before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the
          porch.
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
          
          (BACH VIOLIN OVER:)
          
          Bobby stands in the hallway, a phone to his ear,
          listening to Rayette and looking down the hall
          toward the open door to Catherine's room.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, well fine, you know what I
               suggest, Ray...
                    (listening)
               Because I don't know how long.
               Things are not going that well
               here...
          
          He listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving
          around in her room.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Yeah, well I'm not having any fun,
               either, so why don't you...
                    (pause)
               No, you can't, it's just not
               convenient, and I have to get
               off...
                    (listening impatiently)
               Ray, I really have to go, I have to
               get off now...
                    (longer pause)
               Another couple of days, maybe. I'll
               call you and let you --
                    (pause)
               All right, if you're gone, you're
               gone. Now I have to get off, okay?
                    (pause)
               Bye, Ray...
          
          He hangs up and, as he starts down the hall to
          Catherine's room, the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps
          out into the hall ahead of him. He carries his
          fiddle and detains Bobby, with:
          
                         CARL
               Only 10 minutes of playing and it's
               already killing my neck...
          
          Bobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances
          out at them and then closes the door to her room.
          
          EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
          
          Bobby and Carl, playing a game of table tennis.
          Tita stands leaning against a tree, watching them.
          In the b.g., Spicer can be seen, meticulously
          oiling and cleaning the wheelchair.
          
          As they volley the ball back and forth:
          
                         BOBBY
               You sure you should be playing,
               Carl?
          
                         CARL
               What do you mean? Aside from my
               neck, I'm in superb shape.
          
          Carl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to
          him, he tosses it to Bobby.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (serving)
               I don't know, there's something
               wrong with the way you move.
          
          Carl hits the net again.
          
                         CARL
               I'm not aware of it. Like what?
          
                         BOBBY
               Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
          
          Carl serves and as they volley:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'd hate to see you walk across a
               concert stage like that.
          
          Carl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball...
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Two -- Nineteen.
          
          ... and as he retrieves it:
          
                         CARL
                    (irritated with Bobby)
               I've walked across a stage a number
               of times, without exciting any
               particular response...
          
                         BOBBY
               That's what I mean...
          
          Carl comes back to the table.
          
                         CARL
               Any particular humor, I meant.
          
          He angrily serves the ball.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (returning)
               I think you should get someone to
               coach you how to walk. I think it's
               a substantial problem.
          
          He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some
          shrubbery several yards away.
          
                         CARL
               Dammit!
          
          As he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
          
                         BOBBY
               Look at that.
          
                         TITA
               Why are you being so mean?
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't
               you see that?
          
          She looks at Carl, bent over and searching through
          the shrubs.
          
                         TITA
               I don't think I'd notice. I'm so
               used to Carl.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (wanting to go on about
                    it)
               Yeah, well, he's...
          
          She interrupts him, looking toward Spicer.
          
                         TITA
               Bobby? Do you think Spicer is
               attractive?
          
          He looks over at Spicer, polishing the frame of the
          wheelchair.
          
                         BOBBY
               I think he's got a terrific
               personality.
          
                         TITA
               You know, he was formerly a sailor.
          
          Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back
          with the ball.
          
                         BOBBY
               Look, can't you see that, what I'm
               talking about?
          
                         TITA
               Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
          
          Carl comes up to the table, asserting:
          
                         CARL
               See? There's nothing wrong with the
               way I walk. Now where are we?
          
                         BOBBY
               At game, Carl.
          
          Carl serves and they volley briefly. Then BobbY
          angles the ball sharply and puts it away.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               That's three games to none, Carl.
          
                         CARL
               All right, let's have a rematch.
          
                         BOBBY
               I thought you had to go to the
               mainland today. Aren't you going to
               miss the ferry?
          
          Carl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops
          his paddle onto the table.
          
                         CARL
               Too bad. Just when I was hitting my
               stride.
          
          He starts away, then turns back.
          
                         CARL (CONT'D)
               Say goodbye to Catherine for me,
               will you?
          
          As he moves off in the direction of the cars, Tita
          comes up beside Bobby.
          
                         TITA
               Can I play now?
          
          Carl calls over to them from his car:
          
                         CARL
               Tell her I'll be back sometime
               tomorrow!
          
          Bobby turns to Tita.
          
                         BOBBY
               Where is she, anyway?
          
                         TITA
                    (ignoring the question)
               My turn.
          
          He hands her the paddle...
          
                         BOBBY
               Why don't you and Spicer play?
          
          ... and moves off toward the house.
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
          
          Bobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no
          response, opens it and steps inside.
          
          INT. CATHERINE'S ROOM - DAY
          
          He wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but
          taking in some essence of Catherine from her
          belongings and from the scent of her that lingers
          in the room.
          
          His journey brings him into proximity with the
          windows and he pauses to look out at:
          
          TITA AND SPICER BELOW
          
          playing table tennis.
          
          He starts to move from the windows, when he sees:
          
          CATHERINE'S CAR
          
          pulling into view and parking near the garage. She
          gets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a
          wrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to
          the house to have some exchange with Tita.
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          quickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING
          with him as he moves to the music room and goes
          inside, leaving the door open.
          
          INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
          
          He crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and
          rubs his hands together to warm them. Then,
          scanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands
          on the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude.
          
          Presently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She
          stands listening for a moment, then places the
          shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the
          doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and
          sits down.
          
          Bobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the
          keyboard.
          
          ON CATHERINE
          
          her features intensely concentrated, as she listens
          to his playing.
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          apparently deep into the music. On the wall behind
          him are the series of photographs seen in the
          opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old
          Bobby in his dress suit, playing a recital.
          
          THE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands...
          
          ... then to Catherine, profoundly moved.
          
          ANGLE INCLUDING BOTH
          
          as Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude.
          He lets his hands linger on the keys until the last
          overtones fade, then he removes them to his lap.
          
          After a brief silence:
          
                         CATHERINE
               That was beautiful, Robert. I'm
               surprised...
          
                         BOBBY
               Thank you.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I was really very moved by the way
               you...
          
          Unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a
          brief, derisive laugh issues from him.
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Is that funny?
          
                         BOBBY
               It wasn't supposed to be, it just
               struck me that way.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Why?
          
                         BOBBY
               Nothing. It's just that... I picked
               the easiest piece I could remember.
               I think I first played it when I
               was 8 years old and I played it
               better then.
          
                         CATHERINE
               It doesn't matter. It was the
               feeling I was affected by.
          
                         BOBBY
               I didn't have any.
          
                         CATHERINE
               You had no inner feeling?
          
                         BOBBY
               None.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Then I must have been supplying it.
          
          She gets up and crosses toward the settee.
          
                         BOBBY
               Wait...
          
                         CATHERINE
               Well, at least you're accomplished
               at something...
          
                         BOBBY
               What?
          
                         CATHERINE
               At being a fake.
          
          And as she picks up the flowers and the shopping
          bag:
          
                         BOBBY
               Catherine...
          
                         CATHERINE
               No, you're very good at it. I'm
               really impressed.
          
          She goes out the door.
          
          Bobby looks down at the keyboard. He closes the
          cover and softly utters:
          
                         BOBBY
               Shit.
          
          INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          She stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up
          her hair, preparatory to taking a bath. Her
          attention is drawn to...
          
          ... Bobby entering, and as he crosses to her, she
          quickly turns back to the mirror.
          
                         BOBBY
               You think I'm a fake.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I think it's what you think.
          
                         BOBBY
               No, it isn't what I think.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Look... You made a very calculated
               move, and then made me feel
               embarrassed for responding to you.
               That wasn't necessary.
          
          She moves away from him and he follows her.
          
                         BOBBY
               Yes, it was. You've made it clear
               that if I can cut a little piano, I
               might get a little response.
          
                         CATHERINE
                    (stops and turns to him)
               I don't think that's accurate...
          
                         BOBBY
               Up to now, what I've been getting
               from you are meaningful looks over
               the dinner table and a lot of vague
               suggestions about the day after
               tomorrow...
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'm not conscious of having given
               you any meaningful looks. And as
               for the day after tomorrow, this is
               the day after tomorrow, and I am,
               unfortunately, seeing you... Now if
               you'll excuse me, I'd like to take
               a bath.
          
          She moves back to the dresser and as she begins
          searching through an array of bath oils on top of
          it, Bobby steps in beside her.
          
                         BOBBY
               It's convenient to fake looking for
               something right now, isn't it?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'm not faking anything. I'm
               looking for some bath oil...
          
                         BOBBY
               Some bath oil?
          
          He lifts up one of the bottles.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               What about this one?
                    (picking up another)
               Or this one?
                    (and another)
               How about some jasmine?
                    (and another)
               What about some musk?
          
                         CATHFRINE
               What are you doing!
          
                         BOBBY
                    (knocking the bottles
                    over)
               What are you doing, screwing around
               with this crap?!
          
          A little intimidated by his aggressivity:
          
                         CATHERINE
               I don't find your language that
               charming.
          
                         BOBBY
               It's direct, anyway, which seems to
               be difficult for you.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'd like you to leave now. Is that
               direct enough?
          
          He makes no move to go.
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               You're not a serious person, by
               your own admission. And that may be
               interesting, but it doesn't
               interest me...
          
          Needing the safety of distance, she moves over to
          the windows next to the bed. Again, he follows
          after her.
          
                         BOBBY
               Serious, that's what's important to
               you?
          
                         CATHERINE
               Yes, that's what's important to
               me...
          
          He takes her by the shoulders...
          
                         BOBBY
               Okay, let's be serious...
          
          ... and forces her onto the bed.
          
                         CATHERINE
               No, don't do that...
          
                         BOBBY
               Shut up...
          
          He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants
          to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him,
          uttering a quiet challenge:
          
                         CATHERINE
               No inner feeling.
          
                         BOBBY
               That's right.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I don't believe vou.
          
          He leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms
          encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls
          his body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses.
          And as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery
          and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE
          OVER BEGINS, to:
          
          INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Catherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches
          her as she addresses the ceiling:
          
                         CATHERINE
               I married him when I was 17. He was
               a cellist, and I thought he was the
               most brilliant man I'd ever met...
               And I'm sure he was, because at
               that age, I hadn't met that many...
               But he was insidious, you know. He
               had me convinced that I was a
               mediocrity, musically, as a woman,
               as an intellect. But in this
               completely imperceptible, pleasant
               way, so that you weren't even sure
               he was doing it. Anyway, I just
               woke up one morning and I said, you
               know something Joseph, you're full
               of beans, and I left him...
          
                         BOBBY
               That's what you said?
          
                         CATHERINE
               Something witty and devastating
               like that.
          
          She moves onto her side, looking over at him.
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               As a matter of fact, he's the one
               who introduced me to Carl...
                    (a pause, then:)
               How are you?
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm fine.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Carl restored my confidence. He
               really did. He's much more
               substantial than you give him
               credit for.
          
                         BOBBY
               Is he?
          
                         CATHERINE
               Yes.
          
          She reaches over, tentatively caressing his face,
          then:
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               Do you think you could discreetly
               move across the hall now?
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah, I think I could.
          
          He kisses her, gets up and crosses to the door, and
          as he opens it:
          
                         CATHERINE
               Robert?
          
                         BOBBY
               What?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I could spend some time with you
               tomorrow morning, before Carl comes
               back, I mean, if you'd like to.
          
                         BOBBY
               Of course I'd like to.
          
          EXT. LA ROCHE WOODS - DAY
          
          (CHOPIN OVER:)
          
          Bobby and Catherine walk over a path through a
          thickly wooded area that presently brings them in
          sight of the Dupea house. He stops and, taking hold
          of her, leans back against a tree, kissing her.
          When they break off and resume walking, she takes
          one of his hands in both of hers and, after looking
          at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years
          of manual labor, she lays the hand against her
          cheek.
          
          The ANGLE ALTERS from them, to:
          
          EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
          
          A taxicab pulls up in front of the house. Rayette
          gets out with her suitcase and, after paying the
          driver, moves up the steps to the front door and
          reaches out to ring the bell.
          
          INT. DUPEA DINING ROOM TABLE - NIGHT
          
          ON RAYETTE
          
          looking down the table to Nicholas.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You certainly do have a beautiful
               piece a real estate out here, Mr.
               Dupea.
          
          ON NICHOLAS AND SPICER
          
          the former with his chin resting on his chest.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (turning to Bobby)
               Can he hear me?
          
          Bobby doesn't respond.
          
                         TITA
                    (politely)
               He's not hard of hearing.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, that's a blessing, at least.
          
          She takes a bite of food, and as she chews:
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               This certainly is an improvement on
               the motel an' the coffee shop.
                    (to Bobby)
               How could you have left such a
               beautiful place, Bobby?
          
                         BOBBY
               I don't know.
          
          ON CARL
          
          fascinated with Rayette, while beside him,
          Catherine keeps her eyes on her plate as she eats.
          
                         CARL
               You've been staying in a motel all
               this time?
          
                         RAYETTE
               For two whole weeks, an' there
               wasn't hardly nobody there to talk
               to but me.
               The manager of the place told me it
               was the off season, an' it must a
               ben, because other'n me, there was
               just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon,
               that didn't appear to be all there,
               an' this old married pair next to
               me that was always hollerin' for
               quiet. Can you imagine? All you
               could a heard there was a pin, an'
               them, hollerin' away...
          
                         CARL
               I don't understand why you had to
               stay in a motel. There's more than
               enough room here.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby
               said he hadda kind of feel things
               up here first, which I can
               understand, but then it went an'
               took so long, I ran flat outa
               money...
                    (to Bobby)
               I didn't have no number to call,
               you know.
                    (to Carl)
               So I hadda clear outa there an'
               come on up here, in the hopes that
               I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
          
                         CARL
               Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, thank you, that's a very nice
               thing for you to say.
          
                         CARL
               Not at all.
          
          She goes on eating and there is a brief silence
          before she resumes, looking over at Catherine:
          
                         RAYETTE
               That certainly is a beautiful head
               a hair you have.
          
                         CATHERINE
               Thank you.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Is it natural?
          
                         BOBBY
               Rayette.
          
                         RAYETTE
               What?
          
                         BOBBY
               Just finish eating.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
          
          Carl laughs.
          
                         CARL
               No, you're not. Go ahead and take
               your time.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I do eat slow as a bird, whereas
               Bobby can put it away like a speed
               swing...
                    (to Tita)
               Is there any ketchup around?
          
                         BOBBY
               Oh, for chrissakes...
          
                         CARL
               Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
          
                         RAYETTE
               It's all right. He don't mean
               anything by that.
          
                         BOBBY
               I don't, huh?
          
          He throws his napkin on the table, gets up and
          leaves the room. There is an awkward silence,
          followed by Rayette valiantly covering her own
          feelings:
          
                         RAYETTE
               I guess Bobby's just about the
               moodiest man I ever ben with...
          
          INT. FISHERMAN'S BAR - MAINLAND - NIGHT
          
          (TAMMY WYNETTE'S "DON'T TOUCH ME" OVER:)
          
          Bobby finishes the last of several drinks. He ships
          a half pint into his jacket pocket, lays some bills
          on the bar and moves toward the door.
          
          EXT. FISHERMAN'S BAR - MAINLAND - NIGHT
          
          (WYNETTE OVER:)
          
          Thoroughly anesthetized, he wanders aimlessly
          through the harbor-front streets. As he disappears
          into the dark, the MUSIC FADES.
          
          EXT. WHARF - MAINLAND - DAWN
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          lying huddled on the boardwalk next to the boat
          slips. The crying of the gulls and the sound of
          outgoing fishing launches awaken him. Disoriented,
          he gets to his feet and, hugging himself against
          the cold, moves unsteadily down the dock.
          
          EXT. FERRY - MORNING
          
          Bobby's car pulls off the ferry and approaches a
          line of cars waiting to board. He sees Catherine at
          the wheel of the first car, and pulling abreast of
          her, stops and rolls down his window.
          
                         BOBBY
               Where are you going?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'm going to pick up some friends
               of Carl's. Are you all right?
          
                         BOBBY
               I have to talk to you.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'll be back later...
          
          The blocked cars behind each of them begin HONKING
          impatiently and CONTINUE TO under the following:
          
                         BOBBY
               No, I want to talk to you now. I
               have to explain something about...
          
                         CATHERINE
               No, you don't have to, it isn't
               necessary...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (overlapping her)
               Yes, it is!
          
          A DRIVER behind Bobby sticks his bead out the
          window, yelling furiously at him:
          
                         DRIVER
               Come on, get moving, dammit!!
          
                         BOBBY
                    (turning around to him)
               Will you shut up for a minute!!
                    (to Catherine)
               Pull your car out of line.
          
                         CATHERINE
               No, I can't...
          
                         BOBBY
               Will you let me talk to you,
               please?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I can't do that. I haven't been
               being fair to Carl. I have to tell
               you that.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (barely audible)
               Oh. You have to tell me that.
          
                         CATHERINE
               What?! I can't hear you!
          
          He looks back at her not responding.
          
                         CATHERINE (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry everything's been so
               confusing, but I have to go,
               Robert...
          
                         BOBBY
               Catherine...
          
                         CATHERINE
               Please, I'll see you later this
               evening.
          
          She pulls ahead and moves onto the ferry.
          
          INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          FAVORING SAMIA GLAVIA
          
          a friend of Carl's. (Somewhere under the following,
          the ANGLE ALTERS to include TWO OTHER FRIENDS, as
          well as Carl, Catherine, Bobby and Rayette, seated
          around the living room, variously captive to her
          monologue.)
          
                         SAMIA
               But the point is, man is born into
               the world with a pre-existent
               adversary, both real and imaginary,
               so you'd have to say that
               aggression was one of his primary,
               psychic inheritances, which...
          
          JOHN FINCHER, a professorial type, attempts to
          interject:
          
                         FINCHER
               If I may beg to differ...
          
                         SAMIA
               Beg all you like, John, but the
               fact remains that man takes
               enormous delight in aggressive
               acts, as well as the portrayal of
               aggressive acts, and to be
               triumphant over another no matter
               how, seems fundamental to his
               having a sense of well being, as
               well as...
          
                         FINCHER
               No, I don't quarrel with your
               inference, but you draw too long a
               bow in your conclusions, which seem
               unnecessarily harsh and...
          
                         SAMIA
               Well, I don't make poetry. As an
               analyst, I...
          
          Rayette interrupts, calling across the room to
          Carl:
          
                         RAYETTE
               Is there a TV in the house?
          
          Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia:
          
                         SAMIA
               John believes in the basic goodness
               of man, and that's fine, but gaze
               into the pit like I have and that
               view seems a little soporific. And
               not unlike television, it hardly
               represents the real world...
          
                         RAYETTE
               There's some good things on it,
               though.
          
                         SAMIA
               Pardon me?
          
                         RAYETTE
               The TV. There's some good things on
               it, sometimes.
          
                         SAMIA
               I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't
               really discussing media...
          
                         FINCHER
               If you really hold such bleak
               views, how can you, in good
               conscience, carry on a practice?
          
                         SAMIA
               Oh, there's always hope, I think,
               for a few individuals, if they're
               courageous enough to shed their
               illusions and their...
          
                         CATHERINE
                    (cutting her off)
               And what about love?
          
                         SAMIA
               What about it? Wouldn't you agree
               that a great deal of mischief has
               been done in the name of love?
          
                         CATHERINE
               No, I wouldn't.
          
                         SAMIA
               Well, you're a romantic, Catherine,
               as are most musicians, and what's
               more, about to be married...
          
          ON BOBBY
          
          and his reaction as Samia goes on:
          
                         SAMIA
               ... which should exclude you from
               any objective discussion. But keep
               in mind, even the arts aren't free
               of aggressive content, nor the
               institution of marriage.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I think these cold, "objective"
               discussions are aggressive,
               Samia...
          
          She gets up and starts to move away.
          
                         SAMIA
               But I'd like to say, so that I
               don't dampen the spirit of your
               adventure...
          
                         CATHERINE
                    (cutting her off)
               You haven't dampened my spirit,
               Samia... Excuse me.
          
                         SAMIA
               Well, I should hope not...
          
          She leaves the room, with Bobby's eyes following
          her, and as Carl moves over to sit beside Rayette,
          Samia resumes to Fincher while the other friend
          moves in beside Bobby and tries to engage him in
          conversation.
          
                         SAMIA (CONT'D)
               Because obviously there are loftier
               classes of people that do establish
               a kind of relating, that's
               relatively free of... (Etc.)
          
          ON CARL AND RAYETTE
          
          as she indicates Tita's dog, lying near the
          fireplace.
          
                         RAYETTE
               What kind of doggy is that?
          
                         CARL
               It's a Borzoi.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat
               once, that Bobby give me...
          
          She calls across to Bobby, interrupting Samia.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Remember, Bobby?! The little
               pussycat you gave me?!
          
          Bobby, now feeling trapped by the other friend,
          looks across to her ass she returns her attention
          to Carl.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               She had four little white paws, an'
               oh, was I crazy over her. We hadda
               go an' leave her one time at some
               friends, an' she went out an' got
               smashed flatter'n a tortilla right
               outside their mobile home.
          
          Samia gestures toward Rayette as if she were an
          example to prove her point.
          
                         SAMIA
               There. You see what I mean?
          
          Bobby looks over at Samia.
          
                         SAMIA (CONT'D)
               The choice of words, "squashed
               flat," juxtaposed against the image
               of a fluffy kitten...
          
                         RAYETTE
               Well, she was.
          
                         SAMIA
               Perhaps...
          
          She addresses Fincher gesturing toward Rayette
          again.
          
                         SAMIA (CONT'D)
               But you see how close that is to
               what I'm trying to...
          
          Bobby stands up, cutting her off:
          
                         BOBBY
               Don't sit there pointing at her.
          
                         SAMIA
               I beg your pardon.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (advancing on her)
               I said, don't point at her like
               that! What gives you the right to
               sit there and tell anybody about
               class and who the hell's got it,
               and what she typifies! You
               shouldn't even be in the same room
               with her, you creep!
          
                         SAMIA
               Carl, this is really too much...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (to Samia)
               You're totally full of shit!
          
                         CARL
               Robert, I think you better just...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (cutting him off)
               You're all full of shit!
          
          He turns away and exits the room.
          
          INT. DUPEA HOME - NIGHT
          
          FOLLOWING WITH BOBBY
          
          running up the stairs and down the hall to
          Catherine's room. He goes inside and, not finding
          her, comes quickly back into the hall. As he moves
          down it, opening other doors, he begins calling her
          name.
          
          He comes back down the stairs and runs into Rayette
          at the bottom landing.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Bobby...
          
                         BOBBY
                    (moving past her)
               I can't talk to you right now,
               leave me alone...
          
          He moves to the music room, to the den, then down
          the main hall to the kitchen, which gives off to
          two other doors. He opens one of them, to see:
          
          INT. SPICER'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Tita and Spicer. Though both are clothed, they are
          caught in some stage of intimacy on top of Spicer's
          bed. Tita sits up immediately, mortally
          embarrassed, as Bobby steps into the room.
          
                         BOBBY
               Tita, what the hell are you doing?!
          
          Spicer stands up.
          
                         SPICER
               Hey, this is my room.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (moving over to the bed)
               What's going on here!?
          
                         TITA
               It's none of your business!
          
                         BOBBY
               Where's Catherine?!
          
                         TITA
               I don't know where she is!
          
          Spicer moves to Bobby, taking hold of his arm.
          
                         SPICER
               Don't you believe in knocking, pal?
          
          Bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on Tita.
          
                         BOBBY
               I'm talking to you, Tita!
          
                         TITA
                    (close to tears)
               Can't I have anything to myself, 
               dammit?!
          
                         SPICER
                    (grabbing hold of him
                    again)
               Come on now, out!
          
                         BOBBY
                    (struggling with him)
               Keep your fucking hands off my
               sister, nurse!
          
          Spicer goes into sudden rage, pushing Bobby
          violently toward the door and yelling:
          
                         SPICER
               Did you hear me! Move out!!
          
          Bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries
          them into the kitchen, Tita begins yelling:
          
                         TITA
               Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop!
               I mean it!
          
          Spicer gets Bobby into a painful headlock and is
          being bulled around the kitchen by him.
          
                         SPICER
               Hold it, just hold it!!
          
          They crash into the kitchen table, knocking chairs
          over.
          
                         TITA
               Carl! Somebody get Carl!
          
          Bobby rams Spicer into the refrigerator.
          
                         SPICER
               Take it easy, dammit!
          
          He hurls him against the kitchen wall, still
          holding him in a headlock as Tita enters the
          kitchen.
          
                         TITA
               Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!!
               Carl!!
          
          And as she runs from the room, Spicer begins
          violently jerking his forearm up against Bobby's
          trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated
          command:
          
                         SPICER
               Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
               Give up! Give up!
          
          He feels Bobby's body slacken. He releases him and
          Bobby drops to the floor as...
          
          ... Carl, Catherine and Tita run into the kitchen,
          looking to:
          
          Bobby, gasping for air, tries to get up from the
          floor, and unable to, slumps back against the
          kitchen wall.
          
                         TITA
               Oh God, Bobby, look what you've
               done...
          
          He looks past her, to Catherine.
          
                         BOBBY
               I just wanted to talk to you for a
               minute.
          
          EXT. BAYFRONT - DAY
          
          Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall
          bordering the Dupea property. Each is staring out
          at the ocean, and after a moment:
          
                         CATHERINE
               No. It's useless, Robert. It
               wouldn't work, not ever...
          
                         BOBBY
               Just give me a chance, will you?
          
                         CATHERINE
               I'm trying to be delicate with you,
               but you're not understanding me.
               It's not just because of Carl, or
               my music, but because of you...
                    (she looks at him)
               I mean, what would it come to? If a
               person has no love for himself, no
               respect, no love for his work, his
               family, his friends, something...
               How can he ask for love in return?
               I mean, why should he ask for it?
          
          Profoundly wounded, he looks away from her.
          
                         BOBBY
               And living out here, in this rest
               home asylum, that's what you want?
          
                         CATHERINE
               Yes.
          
                         BOBBY
                    (looking back to her)
               That'll make you happy.
          
                         CATHERINE
               I hope it will, yes.
                    (she pauses, then:)
               I'm sorry.
          
          Needing to distance herself from witnessing his
          pain, she gets up and moves OUT OF FRAME.
          
          His eyes move from her to look out over the bay
          and, after a brief silence, he softly utters:
          
                         BOBBY
               Okay.
          
          EXT. COUNTRY - DAY
          
          Bobby pushes Nicholas's wheelchair along a path
          between fields of tall grasses and wildflowers. He
          stops and moves around to the front of the chair.
          
                         BOBBY
               Are you cold?
          
          He leans over to adjust the blanket covering
          Nicholas's legs and, hunkering down in front of
          him, glances around at the fields, searching for
          articulation:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I don't know if you'd be
               particularly interested in hearing
               anything about me. My life, I
               mean... Most of it doesn't add up
               to much... that I could relate as a
               way of life that you'd approve
               of...
          
          He pauses briefly, then:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'd like to be able to tell you
               why, but I don't really... I mean,
               I move around a lot because things
               tend to get bad when I stay. And
               I'm looking... for auspicious
               beginnings, I guess...
          
          He breaks off again, resuming with evident
          difficulty.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'm trying to, you know, imagine
               your half of this conversation...
               My feeling is, that if you could
               talk, we probably wouldn't be
               talking. That's pretty much how it
               got to be before. I left...
                    (another pause)
               Are you all right?
          
          He searches his father's face, entreating him for
          some kind of answer, some sign of response, and
          seeing none...
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I don't know what to say...
          
          ... he breaks down, barely able to utter the
          following:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               Tita suggested that we try to... I
               don't know. I think that she...
               seems to feel we've got... some
               understanding to reach... She
               totally denies the fact that we
               were never that comfortable with
               each other to begin with...
                    (pauses, trying to gain
                    control)
               The best I can do, is apologize.
          
          He looks silently at his father for a moment...
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               We both know I was never really
               that good at it, anyway...
          
          ... then, bowing bis head:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry it didn't work out.
          
          EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
          
          Bobby comes out the front door. He carries his
          suitcase and, as he descends the steps and moves
          across the drive...
          
          ... Tita, wearing gloves and holding a pair of
          gardening clippers, comes around the side of the
          house and calls out to him:
          
                         TITA
               Bobby!
          
          He sets the suitcase down as she comes toward him.
          
                         TITA (CONT'D)
               You're leaving?
          
                         BOBBY
               Yeah. I said a week, and I've
               overstayed myself...
          
                         TITA
               You were going without saying
               goodbye?
          
                         BOBBY
               I didn't want to say goodbye to
               anyone.
          
                         TITA
               But what about me?
          
                         BOBBY
                    (smiling at her)
               I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
          
          She puts her arms around him and as she embraces
          him:
          
                         TITA
               Just once in a while, call and tell
               me where you are, please...
          
                         RAYETTE'S VOICE
               Watch the birdie!
          
          They turn to see:
          
          Rayette, standing near the open trunk of Bobby's
          car, taking a Polaroid shot of them.
          
          Bobby returns his attention to Tita, kissing her.
          
                         BOBBY
               Bye, now.
          
                         TITA
                    (tearing up)
               Bye, Robert.
          
          He picks up his suitcase and moves to the trunk,
          where Rayette is fussing with her camera. He puts
          the suitcase inside, closes the trunk and takes
          hold of her arm.
          
                         BOBBY
               Come on.
          
                         RAYETTE
                    (resisting him)
               Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a
               picture of you an' me in front of
               the place...
          
                         BOBBY
               No, let's go...
          
          She pulls free of him and, as she moves back toward
          Tita, Bobby can be seen getting into the driver's
          seat.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I never got the chance to thank you
               all for your hospitality. You tell
               Carl for me, if any of you folks
               wanta come on down to our place
               anytime, you'd be more'n welcome...
          
                         TITA
               Thank you, that's very nice.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Bye bye, now.
          
          She moves back to the car and gets in.
          
          ON TITA
          
          watching as Bobby's car pulls out of the drive and
          disappears onto the private road.
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          As Bobby's car moves over a highway through the
          northern forests, RAYETTE'S VOICE is heard SINGING:
          
                         RAYETTE
               "Your kiss is like a drink when I'm
               thirsty/An' I'm thirsty for you
               with all my heart..."
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          Rayette is seated close to Bobby, looking at him as
          she sings.
          
                         RAYETTE
               "But don't love me/Then act as
               though we've never kissed/Oh, don't
               touch me..."
          
          She leans closer and kisses him, then bringing her
          lips close to his ear:
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               "Don't touch me..."
          
          She kisses him again.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               "Don't touch me..."
          
          And again.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               "Don't touch me..."
          
          Her kisses become more fervent and insistent.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               "Oh, don't touch..."
          
          He suddenly pushes her away.
          
                         BOBBY
               Cut it out!
          
          Grievously hurt by his gesture and expressive of an
          anger she's heretofore been afraid to reveal:
          
                         RAYETTE
               Son of a bitch, Bobby! You quit
               pushin' me away like that! I've had
               enough a that to last me a
               lifetime!
          
          She makes a fist of her hand as though she were
          about to hit him, then changes her mind.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Whyn't you just try an' be good to
               me for a change!?
          
          There is no response. She turns away from him,
          looking out through the windshield for a moment,
          then:
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               There id'n anyone gonna look after
               you an' love you better'n I do, you
               know that.
          
          She looks over at him.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Baby? Did you hear me?
          
          There is no response.
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          ON BOBBY'S CAR
          
          as it turns off the highway and pulls up into a gas
          station next to roadside cafe.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY
          
          ON RAYETTE
          
          searching through her purse.
          
                         RAYETTE
               I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get
               some coffee. You want anything?
          
                         BOBBY
               No.
          
                         RAYETTE
               You got any change?
          
          He searches into his jacket, takes out his wallet
          and hands it to her.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Don't you just have 50 cents or
               somethin'?
          
          He shakes his head.
          
                         RAYETTE (CONT'D)
               Okay, be right back...
          
          She reaches to the door and opens it.
          
          EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY
          
          Bobby gets out of the car as the station attendant
          approaches.
          
          Rayette turns back to him as she nears the front of
          the cafe.
          
                         RAYETTE
               Sure you don't want anything?
          
                         BOBBY
                    (to attendant)
               Fill it up.
          
          The attendant moves to the pumps, and as Bobby
          crosses toward the men's room and disappears
          inside, a Peterbilt semi can be seen pulling into
          the station.
          
          INT. GAS STATION - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the
          waste container. He moves to the wash basin and
          stands a moment, gazing absently down at it, his
          mind searching for that inward oblivion in which
          nothing much is demanded, nothing much felt.
          
          Then, leaning over and placing his hands on the rim
          of the basin...
          
          ... he lifts his gaze to the mirror and, after
          minutely perusing the features of his face, looks
          into his own eyes as he had into his fathers,
          silently beseeching them for guidance.
          
          EXT. MEN'S ROOM - GAS STATION - DAY
          
          (SOUND OF SEMI'S MOTOR OVER:)
          
          REMOTE ANGLE as Bobby comes out of the men's room.
          He has left his jacket inside and stands for a
          moment, looking at the...
          
          ... DRIVER, bending down to check the undercarriage
          of the semi. As he stands up and circuits the front
          of the truck, heading for the cab:
          
                         BOBBY
                    (faintly audible)
               Hey, wait a minute.
          
          He moves over to him and after a brief exchange,
          the driver nods his bead and continues on to the
          cab, Bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs
          up into the pass seat.
          
          INT. SEMI CAB - GAS STATION - DAY
          
          The driver glances over at Bobby:
          
                         DRIVER
               Haven't you got a jacket or
               anything with you?
          
                         BOBBY
               No, I don't, I uh... it got burned
               up. Everything in the car got the
               shit burned out of it. All I got
               left is what I have on...
          
                         DRIVER
               I've got an extra jacket behind the
               seat, if you want to put it on.
          
                         BOBBY
               No, it's okay.
          
                         DRIVER
               Suit yourself. But I'll tell you,
               where we're headed is gonna get
               colder'n hell.
          
                         BOBBY
               It's all right. I'm fine.
          
          The driver puts the truck into gear and releases
          the brake.
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'm all right.
          
          And as the truck begins to move forward:
          
                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
               I'm fine.
          
          EXT. SEMI - GAS STATION - DAY
          
          REMOTE ANGLE:
          
          The semi pulls out of the station onto the highway,
          giving view to Bobby's car. The attendant is
          cleaning the windshield and Rayette can be seen
          opening the passenger door. As she gets out and
          surveys the area for some sign of Bobby, the semi
          MOVES INTO VIEW, going north on the highway.
          
          Rayette looks over the hood of the car, addressing
          the attendant. He gestures toward the men's room
          and as she moves across the station and disappears
          OFF THE SCREEN...
          
          ... the semi recedes in the distance, leaving a
          black trail of smoke from its exhaust stack,
          dissipating in the air.
          
                           THE END
