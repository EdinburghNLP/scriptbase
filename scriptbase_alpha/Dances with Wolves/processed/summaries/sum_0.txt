Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union troops to a victory during the Civil War.
He requests a position on the western frontier, but finds it deserted.
He soon finds out he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs "Two-socks" and a curious Indian tribe.
Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians.
He gradually earns the respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways.
