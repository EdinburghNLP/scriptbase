FADE IN: TITLES APPEAR ON BLACK B.G.

TITLES END and we WIDEN to reveal that the black b.g. is 
actually the sludge-clogged surface of the Cuyahoga River. 
We TILT UP from the river to reveal the city of Cleveland, 
then follow with a series of shots of Cleveland landmarks.

INT. THE INJUN DINER - DAY

Three men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the 
counter. BOBBY JAMES, 22-year-old grad student, VIC BOLITO, 
30-year-old telephone worker, and JOHNNY WYNN, 45-year-old 
house painter. THELMA GORDON, 65-year-old waitress, delivers 
their breakfast.

               THELMA
     Spring training starts the twelfth. 
     How do you think the Indians will do 
     this year?

               VIC
     They don't look too good.

The other two shake their heads in contemplation of this 
sorry fact.

INT. MEN'S CLUB - DAY

A 45-year-old BUSINESS EXECUTIVE is talking to a fellow club 
member over lunch.

               BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
     They don't look particularly good, 
     do they?

EXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY

Two LONGSHOREMEN are talking while they unload a freighter.

               LONGSHOREMEN
     I'll tell ya. They don't look very 
     fuckin' good.

EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

Down on the field, two KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS speak Korean as 
they resod the outfield.

               GROUNDSKEEPER
          (in subtitles)
     They're shitty.

We TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the 
third deck.

INT. GLASS-ENCLOSED AREA - DAY

It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are 
seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL 
BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations 
director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel 
Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for 
somebody.

               DONOVAN
          (checking his watch)
     Thirty minutes late. Think she'll 
     show?

               MATTHEWS
     She's got to. She's the damn owner 
     now.

               DONOVAN
     She didn't last week. She was having 
     a guava facial.

As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the 
conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY-
BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a 
flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the 
designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something 
less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA 
on her left hip.

               RACHEL
     Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to 
     another season of Indians' baseball.

The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The 
Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the 
table and Rachel sits.

               RACHEL
     I know that it may not seem the same 
     without Donald here this year, but I 
     promise you by the end of the season 
     this team will have made history.

Several eyes roll up around the room.

               RACHEL
          (picking up a newspaper)
     Unfortunately there are some in the 
     press who feel that...
          (reading from the 
                              page)
     "the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps 
     has no business being the owner of a 
     major league baseball team."

Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.

               RACHEL
     Obviously, Donald didn't feel that 
     way or he wouldn't have left the 
     team to me. And I was more than 
     showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I 
     know some of you have doubts about 
     my ability to run this franchise. 
     God help you if I ever find out about 
     it.

This causes a few nervous glances in the room.

               RACHEL
     Spring training begins in two weeks.
          (throwing a sheet of 
                              paper on the table)
     Here's the list of people we'll be 
     inviting to camp this year.

Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list.

               RACHEL
     I could sit here and tell you what a 
     great year we're gonna have, but the 
     facts are we lost the two best players 
     we had to free agency. We haven't 
     won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't 
     even finished in the first division 
     for 15. Obviously it's time to make 
     some changes. What do ya think?

               SIMMONS
     I never heard of half these guys. 
     And the ones I do know are way past 
     their prime.

               DONOVAN
     Most of these guys never had a prime.

               BUTLER
          (pointing to the sheet)
     This guy here is dead.

               RACHEL
     Cross him off then.

               BUTLER
          (under his breath)
     Let's not be hasty.

               RACHEL
     It's time to shake things up, Charlie. 
     Clear the board and start over.

               DONOVAN
     Well, it's not the best material 
     I've ever had to work with, but I'll 
     do my best to see we move up a notch 
     this year.

               RACHEL
     I know you will, Charlie. That's why 
     I'm movin' you up to General Manager. 
     Congratulations.

Rachel sticks out her hand. Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, 
bewildered by this whole development.

               RACHEL
     Well, that should do it for today. 
     Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to 
     work.

With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with 
her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded.

               MATTHEWS
          (checking his watch)
     One minute, 58 seconds.

INT. DONOVAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, 
pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The 
basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full 
of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk 
accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, 
there's a voice at the door.

               BODY-BUILDER ASSISTANT
     Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps would like 
     to see you.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Donovan is ushered in by Rachel's Male Secretary. Donovan 
carries his player roster with him.

INT. RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY CONT

               RACHEL
     Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat.

               DONOVAN
     I'm glad you called me in. I'm still 
     unclear on a couple things

               RACHEL
     Oh, really? Like what?

               DONOVAN
     Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna 
     be the Manager?

               RACHEL
     I was thinking of Lou Brown.

               DONOVAN
     Lou Brown?

               RACHEL
     He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of 
     the International League for the 
     last 30 years.

This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan.

               RACHEL
     I think he'll fit right in with our 
     team concept.

               DONOVAN
     What exactly is our team concept?

               RACHEL
     That's what I wanted to talk to you 
     about. I want to put together a team 
     that will help us relocate to Miami.

               DONOVAN
     What do you mean?
          (referring to the 
                              roster)
     Some of these guys are furniture 
     movers?

               RACHEL
     I'm serious about this, Charlie. 
     It's no secret I've never liked 
     Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, 
     downtown is a pit, the stadium's 
     falling apart, and we can't draw 
     dick. Another couple of years of 
     this and I'm gonna have to start 
     feeding Cha-Cha dog food.

Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love 
pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust.

               DONOVAN
     Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and 
     move a team on a whim...

               RACHEL
     It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered 
     to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 
     capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no 
     rent for the first million at the 
     gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media 
     guarantee; 45 percent of the 
     concession gross, all of the parking 
     and they pick up the stadium 
     operations costs. No other franchise 
     in baseball can match that deal.

               DONOVAN
     Even so, the League'll never let us 
     leave Cleveland. We got a lease with 
     the city.

               RACHEL
     The lease says we have the right to 
     move if our attendance falls below 
     800,000 for the year.
          (pushing across a 
                              copy of the lease)
     Paragraph 40, line 17.

Donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow.

               RACHEL
     If we play bad enough, we should be 
     able to come in under that.

               DONOVAN
     What are you saying? You want us to 
     lose?

               RACHEL
     No, we've been losing. What I want 
     us to do is finish dead last.

Donovan is stunned. He casts around helplessly for some 
response.

               DONOVAN
     Mister Phelps would never have 
     approved of this.

               RACHEL
     He knew it had to be done. He just 
     didn't have the courage to do it.
          (with veiled menace)
     Hopefully, you will come to see the 
     wisdom of it.
          (pause)
     If this team lives up to its 
     potential, we could have the worst 
     record in all baseball.

On Donovan's sunken face, we go to:

EXT. SHABBY MEXICAN HOTEL - MORNING

On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway. OVER we hear a 
telephone RING.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

The room is a total mess. The back door is off its hinges 
and a few chickens have wandered in. As they peck around the 
debris, we PAN the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers 
and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male 
and female.

We reach the bed and find our hero, JAKE TAYLOR, 35, and 
with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face. 
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late 
twenties. She's not great looking, but at least she's 
overweight. Taylor's hand fumbles to the RINGING telephone.

               TAYLOR
     Yeh.

It's Charlie Donovan calling from his office in Cleveland. 
We CUT BACK AND FORTH between the two as we will in subsequent 
phone scenes.

               DONOVAN
     Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan, 
     new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.

               TAYLOR
          (skeptical)
     Yeh...

               DONOVAN
     I wanted to call and say the 
     organization remembers you fondly 
     from the years you played here and 
     we'd love to have you come to spring 
     training for a shot at this year's 
     club.

               TAYLOR
     Who is this?

               DONOVAN
     What?

               TAYLOR
     Is that you, Tolbert? This isn't 
     very funny, ya know. I'm hung over. 
     My knees are killin' me. If you were 
     gonna pull this shit, you could've 
     at least said you were from the 
     Yankees.

Taylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him.

               TAYLOR
          (still to Donovan)
     By the way, you were with me last 
     night. Who's this girl on top of me?

Donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation.

               TAYLOR
     Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.

Taylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone. 
Taylor looks up to see TOLBERT standing in the doorway.

               TAYLOR
     Tolbert.

               TOLBERT
     Who the hell were you talkin' to?

On Taylor's reaction, we...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. TOLEDO TIRE STORE - DAY

We PICK UP LOU BROWN, a portly man in his early fifties, 
making his way to his glass-partitioned office.

               SECRETARY
     Lines three and four are waiting for 
     you, Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR-
     70's.

               BROWN
          (picking up the phone)
     Tire World.

               DONOVAN
     Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the 
     new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians. 
     Listen, Lou, I hope you're sittin' 
     down 'cause I got an offer you 
     probably been dreamin' about your 
     whole life. We been watchin' your 
     progress down there at Toledo with a 
     lotta interest and well...
          (a dramatic pause)
     How would you like to manage the 
     Indians this year?

For a moment there's silence on the line, then:

               BROWN
     I don't know...

               DONOVAN
          (incredulous)
     What do ya mean you don't know? This 
     is a chance to manage in the big 
     leagues.

               BROWN
     Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie. 
     I got a guy on the other line about 
     some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya 
     later.

Brown clicks off. Donovan puts his head down on his desk.

INT. CHARLIE DONOVAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Donovan's on the phone to another player.

               DONOVAN
     Rick, we heard about your pitching 
     out at Portland last year...

RICKY VAUGHN

Good-looking, muscular, 19-year-old. Sleeveless black T-shirt. 
Talking on a wall phone in a nondescript room.

               VAUGHN
     I'm, ah, not with them anymore...

Vaughn has been working, sweating slightly. He takes off his 
cap to mop his brow -- revealing a RADICAL HAIRCUT with 
PIGTAIL. He sports a RING in his left ear.

               DONOVAN
     We'd still like to take a look at ya 
     at our spring camp in Arizona, March 
     first.

LONG SHOT - VAUGHN

In the b.g., Vaughn is on the phone. In the f.g., we see 
security bars. Vaughn's in a Youth Authority prison.

               VAUGHN
     Yeh, well, I'm not sure I can make 
     it by then.

               DONOVAN
     Don't worry, we're gettin' you out 
     on a sort of work furlough deal. Any 
     questions?

               VAUGHN
     Yeh. Where's Cleveland?

INT. DONOVAN'S OFFICE - DAY

On the speaker again to Lou Brown. Rachel watches, impatient 
for him to close the deal.

               DONOVAN
     Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty 
     years. Don't you wanna advance some?

               BROWN
          (eating a sack lunch)
     I used to coach the unwed mothers' 
     softball team. I have advanced some.

Rachel rubs her fingers together, making the money sign to 
Donovan.

               DONOVAN
     Well, what are you really worried 
     about? The money?

               BROWN
     Naw, I'm just not sure I'd be happy 
     in a big organization like that. 
     Owners are always on your back, tryin' 
     to "help you out."

               DONOVAN
     I don't think that's gonna be a 
     problem.

               BROWN
     Down here baseball's a game, not a 
     business. I don't wanta be a 
     babysitter for a buncha millionaires 
     who think they know it all already.

               DONOVAN
     We don't have any millionaires.

               BROWN
     Well then, bonus babies or whatever 
     you got...

               DONOVAN
     Don't have any bonus babies either.

               BROWN
     Don't you have any proven major league 
     talent?

               DONOVAN
          (embarrassed)
     Not that I know of.

               BROWN
     Well, then... I'll be up in a couple 
     days.

               DONOVAN
     What?

               BROWN
     Sounds like my kinda team. Have my 
     contracts ready.

Brown hangs up.

               DONOVAN
          (to the others)
     Guess I really put the screws to 
     him.

EXT. MEXICAN LEAGUE BALL PARK - DAY

This one's a dandy. The left field wall is a 20-foot high, 
solid granite outcropping. A final out is made and the teams 
change over.

TAYLOR

returning to the dugout at the end of the inning, wondering 
what the hell he's doin' here.

               MANAGER
     Taylor, telephone for you.

Taylor goes to the phone in the clubhouse tunnel.

               TAYLOR
     Hello.

               DONOVAN
     Jake, Charlie Donovan again.

               TAYLOR
     Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry 
     about this morning...

               DONOVAN
     No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts 
     on the first. Can you make it?

               TAYLOR
     Sure.

               DONOVAN
     You been stayin' in shape down there?

               TAYLOR
     Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.

               DONOVAN
     I thought so. See ya in Arizona.

Donovan hangs up. Taylor shoots a fist in the air, and we...

                                   CUT TO:

TAYLOR

approaching his MANAGER.

               MANAGER
     Let's go, Taylor. You're up.

               TAYLOR
     Luis, I'm not gonna be playin' 
     anymore. I got a tryout in the States.

               MANAGER
     Fine. Leave your uniform.

               TAYLOR
     But I changed at the motel.

               MANAGER
     Leave your uniform.

TAYLOR

coming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his 
shoulder. He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts.

INT. BEAT-UP MEXICAN BUS - DAY

Taylor sits in the back seat. He has six Coke bottles filled 
with sand strapped to his ankles. He lifts his legs up and 
down to strengthen his muscles.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. INDIANS' TRAINING CAMP PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching) 
and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the 
arrival of their "troops." First to arrive is:

TAYLOR

He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats 
and luggage.

               DONOVAN
     This looks like Jake Taylor.

Brown turns around from a conversation with Temple.

               BROWN
     He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't 
     he?

               DONOVAN
     Yeh.

               PEPPER
     Wish we had him two years ago.

               DONOVAN
     We did.

               PEPPER
     Four years ago then.

INT. PLAYER'S BARRACKS - DAY

Like an Army barracks. Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. 
Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor.

               TAYLOR
     What happened to the private rooms?

               TEMPLE
     We're on an austerity program. This 
     is what happens when you finish 24 
     games out.

BROWN, PEPPER, TEMPLE AND DONOVAN

back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players.

The first is a tall, muscular Latin, PEDRO CERRANO, dressed 
in black from head to toe. He arrives on foot, carrying a 
black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. He 
looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge.

               BROWN
     Who's that?

               DONOVAN
     I think it's Cerrano. Defected from 
     Cuba. Wanted religious freedom.

               BROWN
     What's his religion?

               DONOVAN
     Voodoo.

BLACK AND TAN ROLLS-ROYCE

pulling into the parking lot. Out steps RODGER DORN, high-
priced third baseman. Brown eyes him with vague disapproval.

               BROWN
     Thought you didn't have any high-
     priced talent.

               DONOVAN
          (sheepish)
     I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's 
     only high-priced. Got him as a free 
     agent three years ago.

               BROWN
     Still hits the ball pretty well, 
     doesn't he?

               DONOVAN
     Yeh, he just can't field it.

Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car.

               BROWN
     We'll shape him up.

WILLIE HAYES

a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72 VW Beetle which 
he's got a Cadillac grille on. He steps out in his shades 
and sharkskin suit.

               DONOVAN
     Don't recognize this guy.

Hayes strolls up and introduces himself.

               HAYES
     Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I 
     play like Mays and run like Hayes.

               BROWN
     Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.

               HAYES
     Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff...

Hayes hustles off toward his car.

               DONOVAN
     I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

A motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's 
attention from Hayes.

Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. He's 
still sporting his radical do.

               PEPPER
     Look at this fuckin' guy.

               TEMPLE
     Maybe he's the mascot.

Donovan is speechless. Brown breaks into a small smile. Yes, 
sir, this is his kinda team.

INT. PLAYERS' BARRACKS

Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker. Vaughn enters 
the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn.

               DORN
     Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks 
     like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, 
     T.B., I love your pony tail. And the 
     earring's cute too. Where's the 
     matching bracelet?

Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, 
making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed. 
It's the one above Taylor. Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in 
silence.

               TAYLOR
          (offering his hand)
     Jake Taylor.

Vaughn shakes it and nods. Says nothing.

               TAYLOR
     So, you just gonna settle for toilet 
     brush, or you got another name?

               VAUGHN
     Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.

               TAYLOR
     Forget about Dorn. He's always a 
     little tough on rookies. You'll get 
     a lot worse from other teams.

The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes.

               HAYES
     Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays 
     Hayes here.

               TAYLOR
     Jake Taylor.
          (pointing to Vaughn)
     Rick Vaughn.

Hayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn.

               HAYES
     What the hell league you been playin' 
     in?

               VAUGHN
     California Penal.

               HAYES
     Never heard of it. How'd you wind up 
     playin' there?

               VAUGHN
     I stole a car.

On Hayes' look, we...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

It's dark. Everyone's asleep. Three SECURITY GUARDS with 
flashlights come down to the top bunk where Hayes is sleeping.

               GUARD
     This guy wasn't invited to camp.

They lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the 
door, Hayes still asleep on it.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first 
day of practice. Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a 
slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his 
pigtail. Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of 
the locker room.

INT. CLUBHOUSE - MORNING

Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout.

               BROWN
     Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. 
     Most managers tell you at this time 
     that all the jobs are open, that 
     nobody's a lock at any position, and 
     that talent isn't everything. They'd 
     rather see desire and discipline in 
     a player. Then they tell you that 
     most of all they want you to have 
     fun out there, even though they're 
     gonna work your ass off on 
     fundamentals and condition you till 
     you drop. The difference between me 
     and those other managers is...
          (pause)
     I mean it.

On a locker room full of uneasy faces, we...

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD PARKING LOT - MORNING

Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, 
his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew 
on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the 
field, he sits up with a start.

               HAYES
     Shit, I been cut already?

THE PRACTICE FIELD

We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time 
trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind 
Cerrano.

               PEPPER
          (checking stopwatch)
     11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen 
     down.

As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher 
named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.

HAYES

looking through the chain-link fence surrounding the field.

DORN AND GENTRY AGAIN

Temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle. 
Dorn and Gentry take off.

Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking 
toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a 
good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go 
to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and 
blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and 
Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look.

               BROWN
     Get him a uniform.

EXT. THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY

The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics, 
counting off in unison.

TAYLOR

struggling through a series of pushups. He glances over in 
disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like 
pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts 
doing them one-handed.

Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up 
and down while leaving his body on the ground.

               HARRIS
     C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.

               HAYES
     Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no 
     pain.

EXT. THE BATTING CAGE - DAY

Taylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm. 
Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second. 
Brown drifts over.

               BROWN
     How the knees holdin' up, Jake?

               TAYLOR
     Great. Never been better.

               BROWN
     Mobility's good? No problem gettin' 
     off the throw to second?

               TAYLOR
     No problem.

               BROWN
     I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who 
     can keep this team together on the 
     field. You were a helluva player 
     when you were sound, but around the 
     league they think you can't take the 
     pounding anymore.

               TAYLOR
     Around the league they're wrong.

               BROWN
     I'm gonna have to put you to the 
     test, ya know. So, I want the absolute 
     truth here. Are you 100 percent?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' 
     like that?

               BROWN
          (walking away)
     You better if you wanna make this 
     team.

Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second. It 
bounces two feet in front of the bag.

EXT. BATTING CAGE - DAY

Brown is watching batting practice.

Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual 
worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, 
knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real 
slugger's routine.

               BROWN
     C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All 
     Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.

Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he 
takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. 
We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes 
prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop-
ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.

               BROWN
     Well, you may run like Mays, but you 
     hit like shit.

               HAYES
     My stroke'll come back once I get 
     warmed up.

               TEMPLE
          (referring to some 
                              stats)
     Never did get warmed up last year. 
     Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up.

               BROWN
     I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. 
     His speed could be a big asset.

               PEPPER
          (aside)
     For what? Running back to the dugout?

               BROWN
     You gotta stop swingin' for the fences 
     though, Hayes. All you're gonna do 
     is give yourself a hernia. With your 
     speed you should be hittin' the ball 
     on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every 
     time I see you hit one in the air, 
     you owe me twenty pushups.

               HAYES
     Hey, no problem.

The next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up.

               HAYES
     Shit.

As he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple.

               BROWN
     Sometimes you can teach a guy to 
     hit. You can't teach him to run.

BROWN AND PEPPER

coming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up 
pitches to Jake.

               BROWN
     All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're 
     a pitcher. Let's see what you got.

Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn 
goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that 
Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The 
ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the 
backstop.

Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with 
eternity, then turns to Pepper.

               BROWN
     Nice velocity.

               PEPPER
     Sounded like it.

               TAYLOR
     Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin' 
     that much octane.

Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who's holding a speed gun.

               BROWN
     How much?

               CLUBHOUSE MAN
     96 miles an hour.

               BROWN
          (to Pepper)
     Better teach him some control before 
     he kills somebody.

RODGER DORN

fielding grounders at third base. He plays them off to his 
left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.

               BROWN
     C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the 
     damn ball.
          (making like a 
                              bullfighter)
     Don't give me this ole' bullshit.

               DORN
     I took one of these in the eye last 
     year. Nearly lost my sight.

               BROWN
     I'm deeply moved. Every time you 
     play it off your hip, you give me 
     forty sit-ups.

               DORN
     What! That's Little League shit.

               BROWN
     So is this.

Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty 
Grable shying from a mouse. Dorn burns.

PEDRO CERRANO

in the batting cage, knocking the cover off pitch after pitch 
with his black bat.

               BROWN
     Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come 
     nobody else picked up on him?

               TEMPLE
          (to the batting 
                              practice pitcher)
     Okay, Harris, that's enough fast 
     balls. Throw some curves.

Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball. Cerrano 
swings and misses it a foot.

               BROWN
     Oh.

Dorn approaches Brown at the cage.

               DORN
     Lou, I wanna have a word with you 
     here.

               BROWN
     Sure.

               DORN
          (whipping out his 
                              contract)
     Those penalty sit-ups you want me to 
     do? I got it right here in my contract 
     that I don't have to do any 
     calisthenics I don't feel are 
     necessary. What do ya think of that?

Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're 
doing to see how Brown will react. Brown looks at the contract 
a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and 
gives it a golden shower. On Dorn's stunned face, we...

                                   CUT TO:

DORN

doing sit-ups in the infield. Vaughn walks by and smiles.

LONGSHOT - PRACTICE FIELD

Practically every member of the team is doing penalty 
calisthenics somewhere on the field.

               PEPPER
          (to Temple)
     We got anybody left playin' baseball 
     out there?

INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn drag in, looking beat from the day's 
workout.

               TAYLOR
     Shit, the way I played today, I 
     wouldn't be surprised if they red-
     tagged me already.

               HAYES
     What do ya mean?

               TAYLOR
     Red tag in your locker means the 
     manager wants to see you, 'cause you 
     just died and went to the minors.

Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it 
now.

               TAYLOR
     Don't worry, they don't cut anybody 
     the first day.

Vaughn is still not so sure. He sits down on his locker stool 
and glances over toward STEVE HARRIS a starting pitcher, 
whose locker is adjacent. As Harris takes off his jersey we 
see three SPLOTCHES OF GREASY SUBSTANCES on his chest, just 
inside the button line.

               VAUGHN
     What is that stuff?

               HARRIS
          (pointing to them in 
                              order)
     Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of 
     'em will give you another 2-3 inches 
     drop on your curve ball.

Vaughn can't believe this.

               HARRIS
     Course if it's cold and I got a shirt 
     on under my jersey, I just rub a 
     little jalapeno inside my nose and 
     get it runnin'. I need to load up 
     the ball a little, I just wipe my 
     nose.

               VAUGHN
          (revolted)
     You put snot on the ball?

               HARRIS
     At my age, you put anything you can 
     find on it. I haven't got an arm 
     like yours.

Vaughn just looks at him incredulous.

TAYLOR AND CARRANO

Taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano 
whose stall is right next to him. Cerrano has set up an altar 
in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like 
sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball 
players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in 
the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth.

Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes 
an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.

               TAYLOR
     What are you doin' there, Pedro?

               CERRANO
     Bats. They are sick.

               TAYLOR
     So are mine. Is somethin' goin' 
     around?

               CERRANO
     No hit curve ball. Straight ball, 
     hit it very much. Curve ball, bats 
     are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. 
     Take fear from bats.

               HAYES
     Jo-Buu?

               TAYLOR
     Maybe he's the pagan saint of 
     baseball.

               CERRANO
     I offer him cigars and gin. He will 
     come.

Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to 
the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. 
Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.

               HARRIS
     I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' 
     around out here with this group.

               CERRANO
          (with a certain gravity)
     Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. 
     Is very bad.

Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving 
everyone to wonder just how bad.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. 
We see:

A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter 
has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the 
plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and 
hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.

B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at 
several curve balls.

C) HAYES

doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, 
except Temple, who supervises.

D) TAYLOR

doing the "scramble" drill -- blocking down balls purposely 
thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can 
hardly get to his feet.

E) CERRANO

waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross 
in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets 
him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.

F) VAUGHN

holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a 
peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.

G) DORN

taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. 
Dorn is pissed.

H) VAUGHN

throwing at the "ropes" again. The tin batter is dented in 
every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast 
ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it 
completely off.

I) TAYLOR

in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. 
Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- 
on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.

J) HAYES

also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping 
it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts 
to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.

K) CERRANO

flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining 
shots are all in exhibition games.

L) HAYES

waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even 
at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but 
it works its magic. No red tag.

M) VAUGHN

with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four 
feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.

N) HAYES

attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for-
leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two 
feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting 
for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. 
Hayes flips him the bird.

O) LOU BROWN

on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, "Can 
you believe this shit?"

P) TAYLOR

waiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch 
it, the runner knocks him flat.

Q) BROWN

his head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the 
wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS.

EXT. INDIANS' PRACTICE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

Players are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK 
UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker 
room.

               VAUGHN
     This is final cut down day, right?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh, better get your snake ready, 
     Hayes.

               HAYES
     No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My 
     hands are too screwed up to hold it 
     anyway.

Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.

               TAYLOR
     If you're gonna use that head first 
     slide, you better get yourself some 
     gloves or you're not gonna have any 
     skin left on your hands.

They've reached the locker room now.

               VAUGHN
     I don't wanna go in there.

               TAYLOR
     Whatever happens, keep it to yourself 
     until you're outta the locker room. 
     Don't celebrate in front of guys who 
     just died.

               HAYES
     What if we're one of the deceased?

Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.

Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this 
time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch 
of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a 
symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white 
paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.

Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers 
inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor 
shakes it and breaks a weary smile.

GENTRY

opens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner.

HAYES AND VAUGHN

the two rookies, are still hanging back.

               HAYES
     C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts 
     here. If they cut us, we'll just 
     sign with the Yankees.

Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This 
doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes 
closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one 
eye.

Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the 
locker room, as if he had to get to the john.

He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around 
like a wild man.

VAUGHN

drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker 
and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the 
"red death." Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly 
closes his locker.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. BROWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's 
desk.

               VAUGHN
     I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You 
     haven't heard the last of me. You 
     think I'm shit now, but someday you'll 
     be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch 
     on somewhere else, and every time I 
     pitch against you, I'm gonna stick 
     it up your ass.

               BROWN
     Good, I like that kinda spirit in a 
     player. The only problem is, I didn't 
     cut you.

               VAUGHN
     What do you mean?

               BROWN
     I think somebody's been havin' fun 
     with you.

We GO TO Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment.

THE LOCKER ROOM AGAIN

Vaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn. The men grapple 
and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them 
separated.

               DORN
          (to Vaughn)
     What's the matter, little lady? Can't 
     you take a joke?

Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou 
Brown enters the room.

               BROWN
     Can I have your attention, please? I 
     counted up your ballots for team 
     captain and I think you chose the 
     right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda 
     told you he won anyway. Mr. C for 
     the year -- Jake Taylor.

The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name 
is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about 
it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, 
he turns to Vaughn.

               TAYLOR
     Forget about Dorn. You got other 
     things to do.

               VAUGHN
     Like what?

               TAYLOR
     Packing for Cleveland.

Taylor gives him a wide smile. Vaughn finally allows himself 
one.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. THE CLEVELAND SKYLINE - DAY

Such as it is. We MOVE DOWN to the same diner we saw during 
the opening of the film.

INT. INJUN DINER - DAY

The same three guys as before are at the counter.

               THELMA
     You see the new lineup the Indians 
     got?

               BOBBY
     I never heard of most of 'em.

INT. EXECUTIVE LIMOUSINE - DAY

The Business Executive is talking to the limo driver as he 
reads the sports section.

               BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
     I don't know the majority of these 
     names.

EXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY

The two Longshoremen again, looking at a paper.

               LONGSHOREMAN
     Who are these fuckin' guys?

EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

The two Korean Groundskeepers again, dragging the infield.

               GROUNDSKEEPER
          (in subtitles)
     They're shitty.

INT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

Taylor is alone in the stadium, standing near home plate in 
his street clothes, taking in the massive stadium, remembering 
glories past. He steps into the batter's box and takes his 
stance.

               TAYLOR
          (to himself)
     Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

Taylor points to the left field stands. He imagines a pitch 
coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of 
the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, 
landing deep in the left field seats. Breaking into his home 
run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base 
coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as 
he reaches the plate.

Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. 
He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are 
giving him a hand.

               HAYES
     Really got all of that one.

               VAUGHN
     What was it? A slider?

Taylor is too embarrassed to reply.

INT. CLEVELAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

One of Cleveland's finest. Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are seated 
at a table.

               TAYLOR
     What are you gonna have?

               HAYES
     I don't know. What language is this?

               TAYLOR
     French.

               HAYES
     They got patty melts over there?

               TAYLOR
     Forget it. I'll order. Let's have a 
     toast.

The three raise their wine glasses.

               TAYLOR
     Here's to baseball, here's to the 
     start of two great careers, and for 
     me, here's to at least one more good 
     year in the sun.

The glasses CLINK. Suddenly Taylor's attention fixes on 
something across the room -- a stunning young woman in her 
late twenties, LYNN WESTLAND. She's having dinner with a 
DATE in a three-piece suit.

Hayes and Vaughn follow Taylor's eyes to the woman.

               VAUGHN
     What is it? The chick?

               TAYLOR
     That's my wife.

               HAYES
     Does she know it?

               TAYLOR
     I mean she woulda been if I hadn't 
     screwed it up. Who's that guy she's 
     with?

               HAYES
     I don't know. He's not wearing a 
     name tag.

               VAUGHN
     You want me to beat the shit out of 
     him?

               TAYLOR
     No.

               HAYES
     What does she do?

               TAYLOR
     She's a librarian.

               VAUGHN
     A librarian? Shit, I gotta start 
     readin' again.

INT. CLEVELAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A WAITER approaches the table where Lynn and her date are 
sharing a dessert.

               WAITER
     Miss Wells, there's a telephone call 
     for you.

Lynn is somewhat surprised, but gets up to take the call. We 
FOLLOW her to the pay phone in the hall.

               LYNN
     Hello.

               VOICE
     Hello, Lynn. It's Jake.

               LYNN
     Jake? How did you know I was here?

               TAYLOR
     Just a hunch. I took you there when 
     you got your masters. I figure you're 
     probably wearing the black velvet 
     dress with the red sash.

She is indeed. Lynn is a little unsettled by this display of 
clairvoyance.

               LYNN
     How did you know that? I didn't have 
     this dress when we were...

Sensing that something's askew, she turns and looks across 
the way to see Jake talking to her on the pay phone on the 
other side of the hall, maybe ten feet away. He gives her 
his best grin.

               TAYLOR
     You look great.

Lynn, as is often the case with Jake, is both charmed and 
put-out. She goes with put-out.

               LYNN
     Thanks. What are you doin' here? 
     Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico 
     somewhere?

               TAYLOR
     I'm playin' with the Indians again. 
     Back in the Bigs.

               LYNN
     That's great. I'm happy for you, 
     Jake.

And she is. Not so sure about herself, though.

               LYNN
          (starting away)
     I gotta get back...

               TAYLOR
     Wait a minute. What's your number. I 
     tried calling you at home, but you're 
     not listed...

               LYNN
     My life is different from when you 
     knew me.

               TAYLOR
     Meaning what? That I don't know you 
     anymore?

               LYNN
     Couldn't we talk about this some 
     other time? I really gotta...

               TAYLOR
     Okay, just gimme your number.

               LYNN
     I don't think that's a good idea.

               TAYLOR
     Why not? Because of the guy you're 
     with? What is he, a banker?

               LYNN
     Lawyer. Please, Jake, he's watching 
     us.

               TAYLOR
     I'm not leavin' without your number. 
     You still wear those great little 
     tortoise-shell glasses? I always 
     loved it when you took them off.

               LYNN
          (exasperated)
     Jake...

               TAYLOR
     The number, Lynn...

               LYNN
          (reluctant)
     All right. 555-9314.

               TAYLOR
     Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm 
     gonna be around.

She looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back 
toward her table. We go to Lynn's date. None of this has 
been lost on him.

INT. TAXI - DAY

Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are the fares.

               CABBIE
     What's the number again?

               TAYLOR
          (looking at a piece 
                              of paper)
     1036. 

               HAYES
     What is this place?

               TAYLOR
     Furnished apartment building owned 
     by the Indians. We get special rates. 
     With what we're makin' we'll need 
     it.

The Cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of 
the street.

               CABBIE
     That's it.

Taylor and the others turn to see a dismal, run-down building 
with a neon sign that says "The Turk."

               TAYLOR
     Welcome to the Big Leagues.

INT. THE TURK - DAY

Jake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number 
Lynn gave him.

               VOICE ON PHONE
     Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.

Taylor doesn't like the sound of this.

               TAYLOR
     You got anybody workin' there named 
     Lynn Wells?

               VOICE ON PHONE
     Never heard of her.

               TAYLOR
     Didn't think so.

Taylor hangs up, staring off into space.

INT. THE INDIANS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Various players are dressing out for the game. We PICK UP 
Cerrano putting on his undergarments. They're all black, 
including his jock. Dorn reads the Wall Street Journal, while 
Taylor sits on the trainer's table getting his knees taped.

Hayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in 
a mirror. He thinks he looks pretty good. Vaughn just squeezes 
a baseball in his left hand, obviously a little uptight. 
Taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder.

               TAYLOR
     Take it easy. We got 162 of these to 
     go.

Lou Brown enters the locker room.

               BROWN
     All right, let's gather 'round.

The players turn their attention to Brown.

               BROWN
     I'm not much for inspirational 
     addresses. I just wanta point out 
     that every newspaper in the country 
     has picked us to finish last. The 
     local press thinks we'd save everybody 
     a lot of time and trouble if we just 
     went out and shot ourselves. Me, I 
     like to waste sportswriters' time so 
     I'm for hangin' around and seein' if 
     we can give all these guys a nice 
     big shitburger to eat.

Cheers all around.

               HARRIS
     Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I 
     mean we're not all savages like 
     Cerrano.

               BROWN
     You guys go ahead. I belong to the 
     church of three-run homers.

               HARRIS
     All right, let's bow our heads.

Many of the players follow suit. Suddenly the silence is 
shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of 
everybody. All eyes turn to Cerrano, who has just set off a 
charge of gunpowder on his locker altar.

               CERRANO
     Have to wake up bats.

Disgusted, Harris and the others turn back to their prayers.

               HARRIS
     Dear Lord, we ask...

Harris never gets to finish. The smoke rising from Cerrano's 
gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the 
ceiling. As Harris and the faithful look up into the downpour, 
we...

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

The stands are nearly empty. Of the fans who have showed up, 
many wear doormats around their necks.

Bobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner, 
sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers. 
All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their 
faces. The three men each have tom-toms. Thelma works on her 
needlepoint.

               JOHNNY
     You read the Plain Dealer today? 
     They said this is gonna be the worst 
     Indian team we've had in years.

               THELMA
     Everybody laughs at the Indians now, 
     but there were other times. Even won 
     the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays 
     made that catch on Vic Wertz in the 
     '54 Series and Cleveland's never 
     been the same since.

               JOHNNY
     As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, 
     huh?

               THELMA
     If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland 
     would die.

INT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM PRESS BOX - DAY

We get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE, the Indians' 55-year-
old radio announcer. Harry's never walked past a bar in anger. 
He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner.

               DOYLE
          (on the air)
     Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, 
     welcoming all you Friends of the 
     Feather to another season of Indians 
     baseball.
          (pouring some Jack 
                              Daniels in his Coke)
     A lotta new faces for the tribe this 
     year, as they take on the defending 
     American League champs, the New York 
     Yankees. And listen to the roar of 
     the crowd as the Indians takes the 
     field!

Doyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying 
to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below.

               DOYLE
     Yes, sir, they love this club here 
     in Cleveland.

Doyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke.

DOWN ON THE FIELD

A YANKEE HITTER

flies out to Hayes, who makes a "basket" catch a la Willie 
Mays.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     High fly ball, centerfield. Hayes 
     under it now... Oh, makes a basket 
     catch, Willie Mays style, and the 
     side is retired.

THE INDIAN DUGOUT

The team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back-
slapping.

               BROWN
     All right, way to look, way to look. 
     Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' 
     do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!

DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX

               DOYLE
     Bottom of the first, Willie Mays 
     Hayes to lead it off for the tribe.

HAYES

going through his warmup routine at the plate.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     A lotta people say you can tell how 
     a season's gonna go by the first 
     hitter of the year. In the last 
     fifteen years, the Indians have never 
     had the season lead-off hitter reach 
     base.

Hayes is in the batter's box now. The Yankee pitcher winds 
and fires. Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward 
the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Hot shot toward the hole. Rudia knocks 
     it down, gets up, fires to first. 
     Too late! Hayes beats it!

Doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some 
cheering.

               DOYLE
     And so the string is broken. Maybe 
     things will turn around a little for 
     the Indians this year.

THE BLEACHERS

Our four fans (from here on known as the Bleacher Band), 
overjoyed by Hayes' hit, start beating the tom-toms and 
singing a fight song they've composed called "In the Land Of 
Burning Waters" to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle.

               BLEACHER BAND
     In the land of burning waters, waters 
     Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we 
     Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their 
     foes to dead men, Ummmmm.

FIRST BASE AREA

as Hayes comes back to the bag, where the Yankee FIRST BASEMAN 
is waiting for him.

               FIRST BASEMAN
     Showed some real power on that one, 
     Slugger.

               HAYES
     I plan to get at least a double out 
     of it.

Hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the 
pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     And now Hayes is putting on a pair 
     of black gloves, sending a little 
     message to the Yankees.

               HAYES
          (to the First Baseman)
     Bought a hundred of these, one for 
     each base I plan to steal. Excuse 
     me, here, I gotta take my first step 
     toward the Hall of Fame.

Hayes takes his lead-off and crouches, ready to steal.

               FIRST BASEMAN
     You look real sharp, but you'll never 
     steal second with your shoe untied.

Hayes looks down at his shoe. It's not untied. He notices 
too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Brewster, quick move to first...

Hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face 
smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is 
already holding the ball.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     He got him. Hayes is picked off.

               FIRST BASEMAN
     Nice base running, dildo. Hard to 
     get your thumb out of your ass with 
     the gloves on.

Hayes lies in the dust humiliated.

               DOYLE
     Well, so much for that.

Doyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we GO INTO A MONTAGE 
depicting the Indians' progressive disintegration in this 
game. We see:

A) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left 
field. They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball 
drops untouched.

B) DORN playing a grounder off his hip. He fumbles it, picks 
it up, fumbles it again. No play.

C) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, 
ready to throw. We hear the voice of his thoughts.

               TAYLOR'S VOICE
     Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get 
     the throw up. Don't bounce the damn 
     ball.

The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. Taylor 
catches the ball and fires down to second. The ball sails 
three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center 
field. Taylor stands there, disgusted.

               TAYLOR'S VOICE
     Nice throw, dickhead.

D) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball. He bawls his bat 
out on the way to the dugout.

E) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before, converging on another 
pop fly into short left. This time all three dive off at the 
last instant to avoid a collision. Once again the ball drops 
untouched.

END MONTAGE.

THE SCOREBOARD

It shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings.

DOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH

There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike. He's working 
on a third.

               DOYLE
     Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, 
     Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You 
     can close the book on Winters...

Vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the 
same intensity we saw in the locker room.

               TAYLOR
     Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four 
     down. We're still in this thing.

               PEPPER
     Don't worry if you're off the plate 
     on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to 
     put the fear of God in a hitter.

Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and 
Taylor leave. The Yankee Hitter steps in.

Vaughn winds and fires a screamer. Taylor has to leap high 
to come down with it.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     First pitch is a little high...

The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.

               YANKEE HITTER
     This guy kinda wild?

               TAYLOR
     I figure you got a 30% chance to 
     survive this at bat.

ANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter. It's outside.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Ball four.

ANOTHER PITCH to a SECOND YANKEE HITTER. It's low.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Ball eight.

ANOTHER PITCH to a THIRD YANKEE HITTER. He has to jump over 
it.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases 
     loaded on twelve straight pitches. 
     By the laws of probability, you'd 
     think one of those coulda drifted 
     over the plate.

THE BLEACHER BAND

Bobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of Vaughn, the three 
men stand to pound out a version of "Wild Thing" on the tom-
toms. Bobby does the vocal.

               BOBBY
     Wild thing, You make my heart sing, 
     You walk everything.

Pepper has reached the mound...

               PEPPER
     Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared 
     enough now. Time to get a few of 'em 
     out.

Vaughn nods. He's plenty upset with himself.

               PEPPER
     Just relax, and keep the arm up on 
     top. Gotta throw strikes. No place 
     at the inn for this guy.

He gives Vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the 
dugout.

The Yankee hitter, HAYWOOD, stands in. He's the first baseman 
who tagged Hayes out.

               HAYWOOD
     Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up 
     here?

               TAYLOR
     Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.

Vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers. 
The ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle.

Haywood crushes it to deep left field. Vaughn drops his head, 
not even bothering to look.

               VAUGHN
     Oh, shit...

The ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run.

               PEPPER
          (to Brown)
     Looked like a strike anyway. You 
     want me to go get him?

               BROWN
     No, let's see how he reacts.

Vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball. The 
next hitter, COLEMAN, steps in. Vaughn gets up on the rubber, 
his face set. He winds up and fires one right into Coleman's 
back. Coleman goes down in a hurry.

               BROWN
     Interesting.

               PEPPER
     At least he hit what he was aimin' 
     at.

               BROWN
     I think you can go get him now.

Both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out. 
The only thing holding them back is that Coleman is being 
tended to by the trainer.

The home plate umpire thumbs Vaughn out of the game. Vaughn 
comes down to protest, but Pepper quickly grabs him and 
hurries him off the field.

               PEPPER
     C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets 
     up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.

Coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken. He 
looks around for Vaughn, but he's already disappeared into 
the dugout. Coleman walks down to first under his own power.

Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides 
begin to return to the benches.

VAUGHN

walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room. He angrily 
knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove.

DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX - LATER THAT NIGHT

He now has five empty cups next to the mike, plus a near-
empty bottle of Jack Daniel's.

               DOYLE
     So, a tough start for the Erie 
     warriors, as they drop a heartbreaker 
     to the Yankees, nine to nothing. The 
     Post Game Show was brought to you 
     by...
          (searching for the 
                              paper)
     Christ. I can't find it. The hell 
     with it. This is Harry Doyle saying 
     good night, everybody, and Happy 
     Hunting.

With that Doyle passes out on his face.

RACHEL PHELPS

in her private box at the stadium. With her are Donovan and 
Butler.

               RACHEL
          (getting up to leave)
     We're off to a good start, gentlemen. 
     Let's keep it up.

We GO TO Donovan. He watches Rachel go in disgust.

INT. THE CASCADE BAR - NIGHT

Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are in a booth, having a beer. Vaughn 
is still in a funk.

               VAUGHN
     God, I was horse shit tonight.

               TAYLOR
     Only thing you got to be sorry about 
     was hittin' Coleman.

               VAUGHN
     What?

               TAYLOR
     If you wanted to send a message, it 
     shoulda been to Haywood. He hit the 
     damn homer. Coleman was just picking 
     his nose in the on-deck circle.

Vaughn nods slowly.

               TAYLOR
     Forget the other stuff. It coulda 
     happened to anybody. Besides, Haywood 
     didn't hit it that good. That ball 
     wouldn't have been out of a lotta 
     parks.

               VAUGHN
     Oh yeh, name one.

               TAYLOR
          (after a pause)
     Yellowstone.

Vaughn just looks at Taylor a second and then smiles in spite 
of himself.

               VAUGHN
     Shit...

EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL LIBRARY - DAY

We see Taylor walking up the steps and through the massive 
front door.

INT. CLEVELAND LIBRARY - DAY

We PICK UP Taylor making his way past the circulation desk. 
He glances around and finds what he's looking for: Lynn, 
talking to one of the reference librarians. She finishes her 
conversation and turns, to find herself face to face with 
Taylor. She's wearing her tortoise-shell glasses.

               LYNN
          (hushed)
     Jake, you shouldn't have come here.

               TAYLOR
     I was wonderin' why you'd give an 
     old friend a bum phone number.

               LYNN
     Let's talk in my office, okay?

               TAYLOR
     I don't wanna talk in your office.

Lynn starts to walk. We'll FOLLOW them as they make their 
way through the library. Lynn tries to keep the conversation 
hushed. Taylor could give a shit.

               LYNN
     I told you I don't think it's a good 
     idea for us to see each other.

               TAYLOR
     Why not?

               LYNN
     We don't have anything in common. 
     Sometimes I wonder if we ever did.

               TAYLOR
     What are you talkin' about? We were 
     both athletes, world class, hot for 
     each other. What more can you have 
     in common?

               LYNN
     I stopped bein' an athlete three 
     years ago. Books are my life now.

Jake suppresses a smile.

               LYNN
     Don't you dare laugh, Jake. In two 
     years I've put together one of the 
     best special collections departments 
     in the country.

               TAYLOR
     So what is it? You're still sore I 
     never read Moby Dick?

               LYNN
     You never read anything I asked you 
     to.

               TAYLOR
     Not like what's-his-name at the 
     restaurant?

               LYNN
     His name is Tom, and keep your voice 
     down.

               TAYLOR
     What do ya see in this guy?

               LYNN
     He's stable. He's intelligent... and 
     I've never found him in bed with a 
     stewardess.

               TAYLOR
     That's 'cause no stewardess would 
     have him. Wouldn't you rather be 
     with somebody who's in demand?

               LYNN
     Just like always, you don't take 
     anything seriously. Everything's a 
     joke to you.

               TAYLOR
     C'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I'm 
     just tryin' to loosen things up a 
     little. I'm gettin' frostbite here.

Lynn stops and turns to face him.

               LYNN
     Tom and I are getting married in the 
     fall.

Taylor is momentarily floored by the revelation.

               TAYLOR
     What? That's crazy, Lynn. I got plans 
     for us.

               LYNN
          (walking again)
     What plans?

               TAYLOR
     I was gonna play another a year or 
     two, then we go to Hawaii, and have 
     a couple kids who grow up to be 
     Olympic champions.

               LYNN
          (stopping again)
     How can you think stuff like that? I 
     haven't seen you in two years. You 
     never even wrote me a letter.

               TAYLOR
     I'm sorry, Lynn, but I wasn't exactly 
     proud of my situation. C'mon, you 
     didn't think about me at all since I 
     been gone?

               LYNN
          (walking again)
     Not so loud, Jake.

               TAYLOR
     Remember the three nights we spent 
     on the beach in Vera Cruz? You have 
     nights like that with Mr. Briefcase?

               LYNN
          (stopping again)
     What about the night you had in 
     Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen?

They're in the large reading room now.

               TAYLOR
     What was I supposed to do? She bet 
     me fifty bucks she had a better body 
     than you. I had to defend your honor.

               LYNN
          (whirling on him and 
                              exploding)
     What a bunch of bullshit!
          (exasperated)
     I have a much better body than she 
     does.

With this the whole reading room turns around and stares at 
her. Lynn is mortified by her outburst. Taylor tries to smooth 
it over.

               TAYLOR
          (addressing the library 
                              patrons)
     She's right. Take it from me, she 
     really does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen 
     has quantity, I give her that, but 
     the, ah, quality just isn't there.

Nice job, Jake. Lynn is still mortified.

               TAYLOR
     How many think Lynn oughta give me 
     another shot?

Most of the hands in the room shoot up.

               TAYLOR
     The ayes have it.

               LYNN
          (walking off again)
     You haven't changed at all, have 
     you?

               TAYLOR
     I'm afraid I have or I wouldn't be 
     here. C'mon, Lynn, I don't wanna do 
     time for things that happened years 
     ago.

               LYNN
          (turning back to him)
     I'm sorry, Jake. You'll always be 
     the little boy who wouldn't grow up.

Lynn starts off for her office door.

               TAYLOR
     Lynn, wait...

Lynn continues on into her office. As the door closes, we GO 
TO Taylor's forlorn face.

INT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY

Rachel is in closed-door session with Donovan.

               RACHEL
     A quarter of the season's gone, we're 
     15 and 24, seven games out of first. 
     Our attendance is just below 180,000. 
     That's bad, but not bad enough.

               DONOVAN
     Projected over the whole season, we 
     stand to wind up 36 games under .500 
     and 28 out of first. That should be 
     bad enough for anybody.

               RACHEL
     We finished 24 out last year and 
     still drew 890,000. When school's 
     out for the summer, attendance is 
     liable to rise. Plus, this team is 
     showing signs of improvement. I didn't 
     think we'd win 15 games all year. 
     Any ideas?

               DONOVAN
     On how we can get worse?
          (sarcastic)
     How about a series of fines for good 
     play? Maybe a $30,000 bonus to the 
     guy chosen Least Valuable Player.

               RACHEL
     This is no laughing matter, Donovan.
          (pause)
     I think maybe the problem is we're 
     coddling these guys too much.

As Donovan wonders what she means by that, we...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. CLEVELAND AIRPORT - DAY

We PICK UP Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the other Indians coming 
down a corridor to their plane.

               HAYES
     What's with this? We never leave 
     from this terminal.

               TAYLOR
     Maybe the other one's jammed up.

They come through the gate where they see two American 
Airlines jets on the tarmac.

               HAYES
          (pointing to the jets)
     Which one is ours?

               GATEMAN
     That one.

The gateman points off-screen. Suddenly, an old DC-3, with 
the Indian logo on it, pulls into frame.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. THE DC-3 - NIGHT

This one was obviously bought from the military. The seats 
are 40's Army issue, and the ribs of the fuselage are exposed. 
The plane is bobbing and lurching through a ferocious storm.

               TAYLOR
     What is this, Lou?

               BROWN
     Front office says it's an economy 
     measure, 'cause we're not drawin' 
     good.

               TAYLOR
     Well, they certainly have spared 
     every expense.

We PICK UP Cerrano crossing himself. Harris sees it.

               HARRIS
     Oh, so now you come around.
          (pointing up)
     He's not fooled.

Hayes sits petrified in his chair, his knuckles whitening on 
the arm rest.

               HAYES
     Call the stewardess, Vaughn. I need 
     one of those bags.

               VAUGHN
     There aren't any stewardesses.

               HAYES
     I wonder if there's any pilots.

INT. MILWAUKEE STADIUM - PRESS BOX -DAY

We PICK UP Doyle doing the play-by-play of the Indians' next 
game. He can barely keep his eyes open.

               DOYLE
     Two down, top of the ninth. Last 
     chance for the red and blue.

THE FIELD

The Brewer pitcher delivers and a Cleveland player hits a 
ground ball to the Brewer Second Baseman who throws him out.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Bouncing ball to second. This should 
     be it. Collins up with it, on to 
     first, and the game is over.

DOYLE

in the press box again.

               DOYLE
     So, the Sons of Geronimo, still 
     suffering a bit from propeller lag, 
     are nipped by the Tigers tonight, 7 
     to 0. The only excitement for the 
     tribe provided by Rick Vaughn who 
     set an American League record by 
     throwing four wild pitches in one 
     inning. Congratulations, Rick. For 
     the Tigers, 5 runs, 9 hits, and no 
     errors. For the Indians, one run, 
     and let's see, one hit.
          (to his Stat Man)
     Is that all we got, one fucking hit?

               STAT MAN
          (whispering)
     You can't say "fuckin'" on the air.

               DOYLE
     Don't worry about it. Nobody's 
     listening anyway.

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Dorn and Harris are at one table; Taylor and Vaughn at one 
across the way.

               HARRIS
     Who you got lined up tonight?

               DORN
     Where are we? Kansas City, right? 
     Gotta be Arlene

               HARRIS
     You call her?

               DORN
     Don't have to. She knows when I'm in 
     town.

TAYLOR AND VAUGHN

               TAYLOR
     I'm about ready to turn in. I've 
     anesthetized my knees enough.

A GUY from the bar approaches the table.

               GUY
     Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, can I have 
     your autograph?

               VAUGHN
     Ah... yeh... sure.
          (signing)
     My first autograph. I couldn't give 
     these away a couple weeks ago.

               GUY
     I saw your record on the news. You 
     made their Hall of Shame. 
     Congratulations.

               VAUGHN
          (embarrassed)
     Thanks.

               TAYLOR
     You're a celebrity now, Vaughn.

               VAUGHN
     I thought you had to do somethin' 
     good to be a celebrity.

               TAYLOR
     Not if you do it colorfully.

DORN AND HARRIS

               DORN
          (pointing to the door)
     What'd I tell ya.

We GO TO the door to find ARLENE standing with two friends, 
RENE and VICKI. ARLENE is a looker alright, 27, and seriously 
built. She cases the room, spies Dorn and comes over to his 
table.

               ARLENE
     Hi, Rodger. This is Vicki and Rene.

               DORN
     Hi, doll. This is Steve Harris.

               ARLENE
     Where's your buddy Gant?

               DORN
          (indicating Vaughn)
     They cut him to make room for bristle 
     boy over there.

               ARLENE
          (looking over at Vaughn)
     Is that Vaughn, the guy they call 
     Wild Thing?

               DORN
          (in disgust)
     Yeh.

               ARLENE
     He's kinda cute. They say he could 
     be a big star.

               DORN
     What are you talkin' about? He 
     couldn't find the plate if it was 
     magnetized. He won't last the year.

               ARLENE
     He struck out five in a row before 
     the wild pitches.
          (taking her leave)
     Maybe I'll check him out.

               DORN
          (grabbing her)
     Wait a minute, you're with me.

Taylor watches this exchange from across the room.

               ARLENE
     I don't remember you makin' any date.

               DORN
     Since when do I have to make a date? 
     Who's been showin' you this town the 
     last three years?

               ARLENE
     Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta 
     look out for myself now. I don't 
     have to be a slave to no .235 hitter.

ARLENE pulls away and heads for the jukebox as Dorn seethes. 
She punches a button and we hear X's version of "WILD THING."

ARLENE sashays right up to Vaughn in time with the music.

               ARLENE
     Wild Thing, you make my heart sing.

ARLENE knows how to make the big entrance. Vaughn's slightly 
overwhelmed.

DORN

taking this all in from across the room. Taylor comes up 
next to him.

               TAYLOR
     Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn?

               DORN
     Speak for yourself, Taylor. I got a 
     couple good years left.

INT. THE INDIANS' DC-3 - NIGHT

We PICK UP Taylor in his seat, glasses on, reading something 
by the light of a flashlight rigged up to the back of his 
seat. We MOVE to reveal it -- the Classics Illustrated comic 
book of "Moby Dick."

Hayes wanders by, an air-sick bag hanging around his neck.

               HAYES
     "Moby Dick?" What is that?

               TAYLOR
     It's one of the masterpieces of 
     American literature, that's all.

               HAYES
     Lynn put you on to this?

               TAYLOR
     Long time ago.

               HAYES
     Well, we're goin' to a club tonight. 
     You wanna come along?

               TAYLOR
     No, I got some more reading to do.

Taylor indicates a stack of Classic Comics next to him.

               HAYES
     What, you got a test or somethin'? 
     Why don't you just go over and see 
     her? Maybe she'll let you slide on a 
     couple of these.

               TAYLOR
     I might if I knew where she lives.

               HAYES
     Easy. Tail her home from the library.

               TAYLOR
     You mean sit in a car and wait for 
     her to come out? That's kinda 
     juvenile, don't you think?

               HAYES
          (as if that had 
                              anything to do with 
                              it)
     Yeh.

EXT. CLEVELAND LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON

Taylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee 
entrance of the library. He scrunches down a bit as Lynn 
comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in 
and we...

                                   CUT TO:

SERIES OF SHOTS OF LYNN

driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete 
distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking 
townhouse. Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches 
her go inside, debating whether to go in after her.

INT. CLEVELAND BAR - EARLY EVENING

Taylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go 
see her or not.

TAYLOR

pulling up outside the townhouse he saw Lynn go into. He 
goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.

Lynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the 
library. She's surprised to see Taylor.

               TAYLOR
     Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you 
     home but I wanna...

               LYNN
          (hurried)
     This isn't my place...

               TAYLOR
     Whose place is it?

Before Lynn can answer, Tom appears at the door.

               TOM
     Who's there, love?
          (spying Taylor)
     Oh, Mr. Taylor, right?
          (pointedly)
     I remember you from the restaurant. 
     Lynn's told me a lot about you. Why 
     don't you come in for a while?

               TAYLOR
     Nah, that's o.k., I got some things 
     to do...

               LYNN
     Yeh, he's gotta be goin'...

               TOM
     No, really, come on in for a drink.

Before Taylor can beg off further, Tom ushers him inside and 
closes the door. In the room are two other couples: ARTHUR 
HOLLOWAY, a senior partner in Tom's firm and his wife CLAIRE, 
and BRENT BOWDEN, another lawyer in the firm and a 
contemporary of Tom's. His wife is JANICE. This is a very 
upscale group.

               TOM
     Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake 
     Taylor.
          (making the intros)
     Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway 
     Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a 
     professional baseball player.

Polite nods from the group, except for Janice, who seems 
somewhat intrigued.

               TOM
     So, Jake, what brings you here this 
     evening?

               TAYLOR
     I, ah, just had a couple books I 
     wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought 
     this was her place.

               TOM
     Well, it soon will be.

               TAYLOR
     Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged. 
     Congratulations.

Taylor sticks out his hand. Tom's not sure whether Taylor's 
putting him on or not. He shakes anyway.

               TOM
     Thank you. What can I get you to 
     drink?

               TAYLOR
     Beer'll be fine.

Tom goes off to get the beer.

               JACK
     What team do you play for, Jake?

               TAYLOR
     The Indians.

               CLAIRE
     Here in Cleveland? I didn't know 
     they still had a team.

               TAYLOR
     Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. 
     It's really great.

               TOM
          (handing Jake his 
                              beer)
     They're last right now, but hopefully 
     moving up, eh, Jake?

Tom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight 
condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor. Lynn is 
uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit 
closer to Taylor. It's obvious she finds him attractive.

               JANICE
     I'm told that baseball players make 
     very good salaries these days.

               TAYLOR
     That depends on how good they are, I 
     guess.

               JANICE
     How good are you?

Lynn is irritated by Janice's directness.

               TAYLOR
     I make the League minimum.

Tom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a 
death in the family.

               LYNN
     He was one of the best in baseball 
     until he had problems with his knees.

Everyone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of 
Taylor, including Lynn herself.

               TOM
     What are you going to do when your 
     career ends? I mean you can't play 
     baseball forever, can you?

               TAYLOR
     Somethin'll come up.

               TOM
     Will it?

               TAYLOR
     I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin' 
     to Hawaii, and having a couple of 
     kids who grow up to be Olympic 
     champions.

               JACK
     Oh really. In what event?

               TAYLOR
     Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter 
     Individual Medley. I figure it oughta 
     be big by then.

Jack just nods. He never heard of it.

               BRENT
     You got the girl picked out?

               TAYLOR
     I did, but I wasn't smart enough to 
     hold on to her.

Lynn's eyes drop to the floor.

               BRENT
     You used to be an athlete, didn't 
     you, Lynn?

               LYNN
          (not wanting to pursue 
                              it)
     Yes.

               BRENT
     What did you do?

               LYNN
          (reluctant)
     Two Hundred Individual medley.

               TAYLOR
     Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team.

A tense silence settles on the group.

               TAYLOR
     Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have 
     met you all.

Taylor exchanges a quick glance with Lynn and heads for the 
door.

               TOM
     Let me walk you out.

Tom accompanies Taylor to the door, out of earshot of the 
others.

               TAYLOR
     Thanks for the beer.

               TOM
     Don't mention it.

               TAYLOR
     I'll let you know if I land a good 
     job. I know you're concerned about 
     it.

               TOM
     Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to 
     know what she would've had ahead of 
     her.

Tom sticks out his hand. The two men shake to keep up 
appearances for their onlookers across the room.

               TOM
     Stay away from her.

               TAYLOR
          (smiling)
     Suck my dick.

INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - DAY

Vaughn and Hayes are watching a soap opera on an old black 
and white TV. Pepper pops his head in.

               PEPPER
     Lou wants to see you down at the 
     office, Rick.

Vaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at Hayes.

INT. LOU BROWN'S OFFICE - DAY

Brown is lost in thought at his desk. Vaughn appears at the 
door like a boy expecting a spanking.

               BROWN
     C'mon in, Rick.

Vaughn comes in and takes a seat. He's worried.

               BROWN
     Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the 
     bush here. You got a great arm, one 
     of the best I've ever seen, but your 
     control hasn't come around like we 
     hoped it would.

Vaughn nods contritely.

               BROWN
     Now, there are a lotta pitchers that 
     started out wild and, after workin' 
     it out in the minors, for a while, 
     went on to great careers.
          (pointing to a picture 
                              on the wall)
     Take Sandy Koufax there...

Vaughn looks at the picture on the wall. He squints slightly. 
Brown notices it.

               VAUGHN
     What about Koufax?

               BROWN
     Never mind Koufax.

Brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and 
goes to stand about fifteen feet from Vaughn.

               BROWN
     Read these letters, starting at the 
     top.

Vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad, 
squinting. Unsettled, he squints harder. He even tries closing 
one eye.

               BROWN
     Can't read it, can you?

Vaughn shakes his head no.

               VAUGHN
     You gonna send me to the minors?

               BROWN
     Nope.

                                   CUT TO:

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. CLEVELAND LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are dressing out for 
the game. Vaughn is wearing his glasses.

               VAUGHN
     These things make me look ridiculous.

               TAYLOR
     Drop in the bucket, Vaughn.

Meanwhile, Cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker.

               VAUGHN
     What's that for?

               CERRANO
     Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo-
     Buu. I still can no hit curva ball 
     for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice 
     to him.

               TAYLOR
     Sacrifice? You mean like something 
     living?

               CERRANO
     Si. I kill unborn children.

               HARRIS
     Not while I'm here you're not. That's 
     murder.

Cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket -- a common 
store bought egg. Harris is a little embarrassed at his 
outburst.

Cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on 
his altar. In one swift motion he slams the knife down on 
it, cutting it into two perfect halves. Taylor and the others 
are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. As the yolk 
spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office.

               BROWN
     All right, let's hit the field.

The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- 
Harris. He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then 
tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker. Screwing up his courage, 
he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin.

               HARRIS
     Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.

He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, 
waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of 
lightning. When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish 
doll in triumph.

HARRIS

strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. 
As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage 
swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. Away 
it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide 
arc. It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him 
cold.

                                   CUT TO:

HARRIS

watching the game from the dugout, a zip-lock baggie full of 
ice-cubes strapped to his head.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     We're in the ninth, two down, man on 
     first and the Indians clinging to a 
     one run lead. VAUGHAN, one out away 
     from his first major league victory...

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

VAUGHAN

Vaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously. 
He goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his 
arm. Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, 
goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate.

THE OAKLAND BATTER

swings and hits a grounder between third and short. Dorn 
moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into 
left field. There is some question as to whether Dorn really 
gave it a full effort.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it, 
     into left field, base hit. Clarke 
     digging around second, he'll make it 
     to third, and the A's have runners 
     at the corners.

Vaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset. He glares 
at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. Dorn's face 
is non-commital. Brown paces in the dugout.

               PEPPER
     You want me to go get him?

               BROWN
     No, he's come this far. Let's see if 
     he can finish it.

Doyle downs a little more rum and coke in the press box.

               DOYLE
     Vaughn in a little trouble here, but 
     I'll tell ya, these Cleveland fans 
     are great. Listen to them get behind 
     Vaughn.

Doyle imitates the sound of a crowd cheering with his own 
voice, punctuated by whistles and clapping.

THE BLEACHER BAND

Thelma calmly knits her blanket with the scores of all the 
Indians' games stitched into it, the Madame La Farge of 
Cleveland. The boys, however, are a little restless.

               BOBBY
     We need some defense here. Maybe we 
     oughta do a wave.

               JOHNNY
     C'mon, Indians don't do waves. Let's 
     keep this thing pure.

               VIC
     What harm could it do?

REXMAN

The next Oakland hitter, steps in. Taylor flashes a sign. 
Vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers. High, ball one. 
The runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the 
pitch being too tough to handle.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Runner goes, high, Taylor has no 
     play. The go-ahead and potential 
     winning run is in scoring position.

Taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball 
back to Vaughn.

               TAYLOR
     Forget the runners, Ricky, get this 
     guy at the plate.

Taylor goes back behind the dish. Vaughn gets up on the 
rubber. He winds and comes to the plate. Way high this time.

               DOYLE
     High ball two, and the crowd doesn't 
     like that call one bit.

Doyle imitates the sound of a crowd booing. Taylor, meanwhile, 
has gone out to the mound.

               TAYLOR
     Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick. 
     You know he's lookin' for this pitch. 
     Gotta come up with somethin' studly.

               VAUGHN
     Fuckin' Dorn. Game shoulda been over 
     by now. Dorn coulda had that ball. 
     He tanked it on purpose.

               TAYLOR
     This isn't the California Penal 
     League, Vaughn. We're professionals 
     here. We don't tank a play for 
     personal reasons, so cut the crybaby 
     shit. You've pitched a helluva game. 
     You wanna finish it, don't ya?

Vaughn nods.

               TAYLOR
     Can you give me a strike on this 
     pitch?

               VAUGHN
     Yeh, but I don't know if there'll be 
     much on it. My arm feels like jello.

               TAYLOR
     Just make sure it's over the plate. 
     I want him to swing.

               VAUGHN
     The last time I did that, the guy 
     hit one that hasn't landed yet.

               TAYLOR
     Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

Taylor starts back toward the plate, and then stops.

               TAYLOR
     By the way, I been meaning to ask 
     you. Why'd you steal that car?

               VAUGHN
     I was bored.

               TAYLOR
     Next time you might think about takin' 
     in a movie or somethin'.

Vaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the 
tension. Taylor smiles back, and trots off toward the plate.

THE BLEACHER BAND

Bobby and Vic are doing a two-man wave. When one sits down, 
the other stands up.

TAYLOR

has settled in behind the plate now. He starts talking to 
the batter, Rexman.

               TAYLOR
     Helluva situation we got goin' here, 
     huh, Rexman? Two on, two out, you're 
     down by a run in the ninth. You got 
     a chance to be a hero on national 
     television, so whatever you do, don't 
     blow it. They'll be callin' you a 
     gutless choke artist all over America.

Rexman shoots Taylor a wicked glance.

               TAYLOR
     You're a free agent at the end of 
     the year. Not much demand for gutless 
     choke artists. What are you hittin' 
     now? .230? .240?

               REXMAN
     .316.

               TAYLOR
     Hey, nice average. Uh oh, on second 
     thought, that still means you got a 
     seven outta ten chance of goin' in 
     the dumper.

Rexman, slightly irritated, backs out of the box.

               REXMAN
     Shut up, will ya, Taylor?

               TAYLOR
     Hey, I can understand not wantin' to 
     talk about baseball when your nuts 
     are in a vice like this.

Rexman gets back in the box.

               TAYLOR
     By the way, I saw your wife at the 
     Capri Lounge last night. Hell of a 
     dancer. You must be very proud.

Rexman is trying to ignore Taylor, but failing badly. Taylor 
flashes a sign to Vaughn. Vaughn goes into his windup.

               TAYLOR
     But that guy she was with... I mean 
     I'm sure he's a close personal friend 
     of yours and all, but tell me...

Vaughn releases his pitch.

               TAYLOR
     ...Why was he wearing her panties on 
     his head?

Rexman, completely unnerved, takes a feeble swing and hits a 
high pop-up out in front of the plate.

               TAYLOR
     Uh oh, Rexie, I don't think that 
     one's got the distance. Maybe if the 
     wind comes up.

Taylor moves out two steps and makes the catch easily, ending 
the game.

Taylor rushes out to congratulate Vaughn. The players exchange 
handshakes and high fives, as Brown watches from the dugout.

               BROWN
     It's startin' to come together, 
     Pepper. It's startin' to come 
     together.

EXT. DORN MANSION - AFTERNOON

Taylor pulls up outside and walks up to the door. Suzanne, 
Dorn's wife, answers.

               SUZANNE
     Oh hi, Jake, how are you?

               TAYLOR
     Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick 
     word with Rodger?

               SUZANNE
     Sure, c'mon in, he's in the den. 
     I'll get some coffee.

We FOLLOW Taylor into the luxurious den, where we find Dorn 
watching his wide screen TV in a smoking jacket.

               DORN
     Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you 
     out here?

               TAYLOR
     I just wanta tell ya somethin', but 
     I didn't want to do it in front of 
     the whole team.

               DORN
     Sure, go ahead.

               TAYLOR
          (like nails)
     I don't know what your problem is, 
     but...
          (bending close to 
                              Dorn)
     ...if I ever see you tank another 
     play like you did tonight, I'll cut 
     off your nuts and stuff 'em down 
     your fuckin' throat.

Dorn looks at Taylor for some sign that he's kidding. He 
doesn't get one.

Taylor turns and walks on out, as we go to Dorn's stunned 
face. Suzanne walks in with a tray.

               SUZANNE
     Coffee anybody?

INT. INDIANS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY

The Indians are undressing after practice.

               HAYES
     Why the hell are we havin' practice 
     during the All-Star break?

               TAYLOR
     I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered 
     it.

               VAUGHN
     It's hotter than shit in here. What 
     happened to the air conditioning?

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

We go to Brown, naked and dragging from the heat. He 
approaches the whirlpool and turns on the water.

               BROWN
          (to Dorn)
     Oh man, this old body can use a soak.

               DORN
     Forget it. It's not workin' again.

Brown flips on a switch. The whirlpool makes some grinding 
noises and then quits altogether.

               BROWN
     Damn it, I thought they were gonna 
     replace this thing.

Harris shouts over from the showers where he's just turned 
on the water.

               HARRIS
     Hey, there's no hot water in here.

               BROWN
     She's at it again. I've had it with 
     this nickel and dime stuff.
          (storming out of the 
                              training room)
     I'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone.

Brown is stopped short by the sight of Rachel Phelps standing 
in the middle of the locker room as various unclad players 
dive for cover.

               RACHEL
     You wanted to see the Bitch?

               BROWN
     Yeh.

               RACHEL
     Don't you think you oughta cover 
     yourself with a towel first, Mr. 
     Brown?

               BROWN
     There aren't any towels, and I'm too 
     old to be diving under benches.

               RACHEL
     Well, I can take it if you can.

               BROWN
     What happened to the new whirlpool 
     we were supposed to get?

               RACHEL
     Revenue problems have forced us to 
     cut back on equipment. We'll simply 
     have to fix the old one.

               BROWN
     You fixed it six times already. And 
     now there's no hot water in the 
     showers.

               RACHEL
     The pipes in this building are old 
     and rusted. We're replacing them, 
     but it's a long, expensive process.

               BROWN
     How am I supposed to keep my players 
     healthy with cold water and no therapy 
     equipment?

               RACHEL
     Your players will just have to get a 
     little tougher. What are they, a 
     bunch of pansies?

Immediately, 30 arms shoot up behind her in the Italian "up-
yours" gesture. She turns around, but by then the players 
have quickly returned to normal positions.

               BROWN
     Over 162 games even tough guys get 
     sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...

               RACHEL
     It's only temporary. Besides, these 
     guys weren't playing that good when 
     the equipment was workin'. If I could 
     get anybody to come and watch this 
     team, none of this would be necessary. 
     You oughta be grateful I can still 
     pay your salaries.

With that, Rachel turns and walks out. Brown and the others 
can only watch her go.

     In case you haven't noticed, and 
     judging by attendance, you haven't, 
     the Indians, that thought-to-be 
     hopeless collection of has-been's 
     and never-will-be's is actually 
     approaching the .500 mark, and with 
     it, semi-respectability. Nothing to

[...] 

Brown storms out of the dugout, doing his best to look 
incensed.

               TAYLOR
     Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a 
     break, Mel. I gotta get outta here.

               WINGO
     All right, kick some dirt on me. The 
     Commissioner'll buy that.

               TAYLOR
     Right. Good idea.

Taylor begins kicking dirt on Wingo's shoes, ala Billy Martin. 
Wingo takes a dramatic hop, skip and jump and gives Taylor 
the heave-ho thumb just as Brown arrives. Wingo turns away.

               BROWN
          (to Wingo)
     Hey, don't you go anywhere. I wanna 
     have a few words with you.

Brown grabs Taylor and pulls him aside.

               BROWN
          (under his breath)
     What are we arguin' about here?

               TAYLOR
          (struggling as if he 
                              wanted to get at 
                              Wingo)
     Fucker called that a ball.

               BROWN
     You mean the one that was a foot 
     outside?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh.

Taylor breaks away and starts back to the dugout. Playing it 
to the hilt, he throws his glove and mask to the ground on 
the way.

Meanwhile, Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo, outraged at 
the call. Brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket, and 
offers it to Wingo, who immediately thumbs him out.

LYNN

leaving her seat and starting up the aisle.

Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room, still in 
full uniform. He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn 
disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot.

LYNN

in the parking lot. As she goes to unlock her car, Taylor 
looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow 
her in.

He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard.

Inside is the Bullpen car, a souped-up golf cart with a body 
shaped like a batting helmet. Taylor hops in and roars out 
after Lynn.

INT. CLEVELAND ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT

Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, 
deserted this time of night. She wears a racing suit, but 
lets her hair hang free. The pool glows like a sheet of 
emerald glass. She shakes down a beat, curls her toes around 
the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches 
into a full-out racing dive.

We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first 
the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally 
freestyle. We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some 
underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, 
her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. 
The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes 
and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, 
its synthesis of power and form.

As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the 
pool next to her. It's Jake, and he's racing her the final 
lap. She immediately responds to the challenge, digging 
harder, picking up her kick. They go neck and neck for 20 
yards, but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a 
body length at the wall. Both are winded.

               TAYLOR
     You still got that great kick. Just 
     like the first time I ever saw you.

               LYNN
     You follow me here too?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh, what did you want to see me 
     about?

               LYNN
     What do you mean?

               TAYLOR
     You wouldn't have been at the game 
     if you didn't want to see me about 
     something.

               LYNN
          (getting out of the 
                              pool)
     I just wanted to see you play.

               TAYLOR
     How was I?

               LYNN
     You looked good, but you oughta open 
     your stance a little. They're pitching 
     you inside.

               TAYLOR
     I'll try that. You wanna have some 
     dinner?

               LYNN
     Sorry, I already ate.

               TAYLOR
     Right. I forgot your life is different 
     now.

               LYNN
          (getting out of the 
                              pool)
     Thanks for the race.

               TAYLOR
          (watching her go)
     Anytime.

INT. LYNN'S CAR - NIGHT

Driving through the city on her way home. Lynn glances in 
the rear-view mirror and spots Taylor following her. She 
smiles to herself. Taylor, of course, thinks he's gone 
undetected.

We begin a SHORT SEQUENCE during which Lynn tries to lose 
Taylor in a chase through Cleveland, car vs. batting helmet.

The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland, but 
suffice it to say, by the end of the chase she appears to 
have ditched him.

EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and 
steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure 
she's shaken Taylor.

The apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, 
Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. 
It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. 
She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some 
sign of him.

Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, 
and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's 
Taylor, standing in the doorway.

               TAYLOR
     Whose place are we at this time?

               LYNN
          (flustered)
     Mine. You follow me again?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I 
     figured you wanted to see me about 
     something.

               LYNN
     I just wanted to see you play.

               TAYLOR
     How was I?

               LYNN
     You looked good, but you oughta open 
     your stance a little. They're pitchin' 
     you inside.

               TAYLOR
     I'll try that.

Taylor gives a perfunctory nod. They look at each other a 
second. There's still plenty there. Taylor begins to come 
toward her. We hear his cleats on the floor. She backs off, 
but not with real conviction.

               LYNN
     I think I oughta tell you that I'm 
     moving in with Tom.

               TAYLOR
     Goin' uptown, huh?

               LYNN
     I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to 
     lead a regular life. You know, like 
     an adult maybe. With a house and a 
     garden and normal hours.

               TAYLOR
     You think I can't lead a regular 
     life?

               LYNN
     You like the life you've had, Jake. 
     You like hangin' out with the boys, 
     livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at 
     midnight, having girls send you their 
     underwear in the mail. Remember the 
     surprise party I threw for you when 
     you made the All-Star team? You never 
     showed up, but the doorbell rang 
     once and we all got quiet and hid 
     behind the furniture. It was a guy 
     to serve you with a paternity suit.

               TAYLOR
     That was a hoax. The girl was just 
     trying to get some publicity.

               LYNN
     Yes, but you had obviously been with 
     her. And it happened in front of all 
     our friends.

               TAYLOR
     I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements 
     were dryin' up, my knees were goin', 
     they were talkin' about sendin' me 
     down. I was just trying to hold on 
     to somethin', prove to myself I was 
     still an All-Star. I don't care about 
     that anymore. I know I don't have 
     much time left in baseball. I'm just 
     a guy trying to put his life back 
     together. Thinkin' about you was the 
     only thing that kept me goin' in 
     Mexico.

Lynn looks at him a long beat.

               LYNN
     I've come back to you too many times, 
     Jake. I can't afford to believe you 
     anymore.

Lynn is backed up against a desk now. She could move out but 
doesn't.

               TAYLOR
     I guess this is our last hurrah then.

               LYNN
     I guess so. Did you really read "Moby 
     Dick?"

               TAYLOR
     Cover to cover.

Taylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. Their 
conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity 
of their kissing.

               TAYLOR
     When's the wedding?

               LYNN
     October third.

               TAYLOR
     Your mom and dad like this guy?

               LYNN
     You're still their favorite.

They're unbuttoning each other's shirts now.

               TAYLOR
     Gonna be a big wedding?

               LYNN
     Tom doesn't like big weddings. You 
     coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 
     Great Novels.

               TAYLOR
     Where?

               LYNN
     At any library.

               TAYLOR
     I mean the wedding.

               LYNN
     All Saints on Euclid.

               TAYLOR
     Nice church.

               LYNN
     Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?

               TAYLOR
     Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am 
     I invited?

               LYNN
     Where?

               TAYLOR
     To the wedding.

               LYNN
     If you want. Maybe you really did 
     read it.

Their shirts are off now.

               LYNN
     This doesn't change anything, you 
     know. We were always good at this.

               TAYLOR
     Lynn?

               LYNN
     What?

               TAYLOR
     The zipper on your skirt is stuck.

               LYNN
     Use your imagination.

Taylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the 
material, ripping it from her body and pinning it to the 
wood floor. Taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks Lynn OUT 
OF FRAME. We hold on the skirt, nailed to the floor by the 
cleats.

INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Taylor wakens and turns over to find Lynn gone. He looks 
around but there's no sign of her.

EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Taylor comes down the steps, gets in his car, and drives OUT 
OF FRAME. We HOLD on the SHOT, and...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAME SHOT - THAT NIGHT

Taylor's car pulls INTO FRAME. He gets out and goes up the 
steps. There's one light on in the apartment window. Taylor 
comes up to the door and knocks. Getting no answer, he pushes 
it open to find that the apartment is completely empty. Just 
bare hardwood floor. Taylor stands forlorn in the center of 
the room a beat, then walks on out, switching off the overhead 
light as he goes.

INT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY

Donovan is present once again. Rachel does not look pleased.

               RACHEL
     Well, my worst fears have been 
     confirmed. We're 60 and 60, nine 
     games out of first, and only two out 
     of the first division. Who do those 
     guys think they are?

               DONOVAN
     Maybe you just have to accept the 
     fact that they're not as bad as you'd 
     hoped.

               RACHEL
     I don't have to accept anything. Our 
     attendance is only beginning to rise. 
     If we can force a losing streak for 
     a week or two, we can still turn 
     this thing around. The fans are used 
     to losers here. At the first sign of 
     a slump they'll give up on this team.

               DONOVAN
     What's left to do? You've taken away 
     everything you can.

               RACHEL
     Not everything.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

We pick up a decrepit old Greyhound bus coming down the 
highway, belching smoke like a diesel semi. On the side we 
see the visage of Chief Wahoo and the words "Indian Express."

INT. INDIAN EXPRESS - DAY

Complete with all the luxuries of the average school bus. 
Temple is looking at a memo from Rachel Phelps.

               TEMPLE
     Memo says we'll only be usin' this 
     for short trips.

               BROWN
     Good thing we don't play anybody in 
     Europe.

TAYLOR AND HAYES

Taylor is staring out the window, still morose about Lynn's 
leaving. A stack of Classics Illustrated comics sits next to 
him.

               HAYES
     Can I borrow one of those, man? They 
     don't have any magazines on this 
     bus.

               TAYLOR
     Sure, go ahead. I think my reading 
     days are over.

               HAYES
     Macbeth. This a good one?

               TAYLOR
          (pointing to his stack 
                              of Classics)
     These are all Hall of Famers.

Hayes is impressed.

EXT. CITY OF NEW YORK - NIGHT

The Indian Express makes its way through the streets of New 
York, enroute to the Indian's hotel.

INT. INDIAN EXPRESS - FULL SHOT

We see that now most of the team is reading classic comics.

               HAYES
          (to Dorn)
     I'll trade you Song of Hiawatha for 
     The Deerslayer.

               DORN
     Naw, I'm not into Song of Hiawatha.

               HAYES
     All right then, how about Crime and 
     Punishment?

               DORN
     Yeh, that sounds pretty good. That's 
     a detective story, right?

               HAYES
     Yeh.

INT. INDIAN EXPRESS - NIGHT

The bus slows down and pulls over to the curb.

               DRIVER
     This is it. The Sheffield Arms.

The players all crowd to the window to get a glimpse of their 
hotel. Hotel is actually overstating it. This place is one 
cut below the YMCA.

               BROWN
     I don't know if we can survive any 
     more of these economy measures.

INT. THE SHEFFIELD ARMS - DAY

We pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their 
dilapidated hotel room. Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety 
furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on 
one of the cots. It collapses on the floor in a cloud of 
dust.

EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - DAY

Vaughn is on the mound warming up.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his 
     only other appearance against the 
     Yankees, will see what he can do 
     with the Bronx Bombers this time. 
     Vaughn, after a slow start, has come 
     on lately and now leads the American 
     League in strikeouts with 221.

Vaughn finishes his warmups. As Taylor pumps the ball down 
to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out.

               VOICE
     Hey, jailbird!

Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is 
dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long 
earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries 
to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.

Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds 
and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to 
the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it 
back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict 
whoops it up.

Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, 
he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a 
pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much 
to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in 
the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second 
goes to third.

               TAYLOR
          (throwing the ball 
                              back)
     C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.

Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the 
lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against 
the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking 
up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His 
next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a 
run.

THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN

throwing pitches, followed by:

SHOTS

of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field 
line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, 
and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now 
reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.

               TAYLOR
     What's the problem, Rick? You're 
     throwin' basketballs up there. That 
     guy in the dugout botherin' you?

               VAUGHN
     Naw, I'm all right.

               TAYLOR
     Forget him. Worry about the guys 
     carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's 
     get nasty.

Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate.

Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps 
into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face.

As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into 
his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars. 
Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his 
teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. 
This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics.

Vaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood 
creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes 
doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches 
it go. 6-0 Yankees.

               BROWN
     I thought now that Vaughn had some 
     control, he was ready for the Yankees.

               PEPPER
     Not quite yet.

Brown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     So, Vaughn pitches in some tough 
     luck here as the Yankees put together 
     as few squib hits and take a 6-0 
     lead.

DOYLE

in the press box. The stadium below is empty, the grounds 
crew covering the infield.

               DOYLE
     Well, the Indians made a gallant 
     comeback today, but fell one run 
     short as the Yankees held on for a 6-
     5 victory, although they didn't do 
     squat after the first inning. Anyway, 
     if the bus makes it here from the 
     hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow 
     night. Till then, this is Harry Doyle, 
     saying so long, everybody, and Happy 
     Hunting.

INT. THE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Brown is alone in the bar having a drink. A figure sits down 
on the stool next to him. It's Donovan.

               DONOVAN
     Mind if I join you?

               BROWN
          (surprised to see him)
     Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin' 
     here?

               DONOVAN
     Just wanted to get out on the road. 
     You damn near pulled one out today.

               BROWN
     Someday we'll figure out how to beat 
     those guys.

               DONOVAN
     Ya know, you've done a helluva job 
     this year.

               BROWN
     Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a 
     helluva job.

               DONOVAN
     With this club it is.

               BROWN
     Ya know, when I first got to camp I 
     figured this team had no chance. I 
     was just hopin' we'd win enough that 
     I could stay on and really start to 
     build something here. But there's a 
     lotta talent on this club, Charlie. 
     The veterans are starting to play 
     back to form and the rookies are 
     developing faster than I thought. 
     There's two or three potential all-
     stars in there. I think we're a first 
     division team right now.

               DONOVAN
     You really believe that, don't you?

               BROWN
     I know it. All we need is something 
     to bring it all together.

               DONOVAN
     Rachel Phelps would never allow that.

               BROWN
     What do you mean?

               DONOVAN
     She doesn't want you in the first 
     division. She doesn't even want you 
     in Cleveland.

On Brown's incredulous face, we...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. INDIANS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

The players are all gathered around, obviously having been 
called together by Brown.

               BROWN
          (addressing the group)
     I got somethin' I think you oughta 
     know about. I wouldn't have known 
     about it myself if Charlie Donovan 
     hadn't told me, although I shoulda 
     guessed it from everything that's 
     happened. It seems that Mrs. Phelps 
     doesn't think too highly of our worth.

We take several CUTS OF FACES around the room.

               BROWN
     She put this team together because 
     she thought we'd be bad enough to 
     finish dead last, knockin' attendance 
     down to the point where she could 
     move the team to Miami.
          (pause)
     And get rid of all of us for better 
     personnel.

Taylor, Vaughn, Hayes, Dorn, and the others can hardly believe 
what they're hearing.

               DORN
     Even me?

               BROWN
     Even you, Dorn.

Silence descends on the room.

               HAYES
     In other words, Phelps thinks we're 
     all dinks. That we don't belong in 
     the big leagues.

               BROWN
     That's about it.

               HARRIS
     What if we don't finish last?

               BROWN
     She'll replace you with somebody who 
     will. After this season, you'll all 
     be sent back to the minors or given 
     your outright release.
          (pause)
     So, all we're gonna get is this one 
     year.

Taylor surveys the bowed heads around the room. He stands to 
address the group.

               TAYLOR
     I don't know about the rest of you, 
     but I've been playin' baseball since 
     I was five years old. I've had some 
     good years and some years to forget. 
     I've burned out my knees... I don't 
     think I have three fingers that work 
     right... I've lost most of the money 
     I made and baseball has messed up my 
     personal life from time to time. But 
     I know one thing... I can still play 
     this game a little. And I'd like to 
     know who in this room thinks they're 
     the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is lookin' 
     for?

Eyes dart around the room, then come back to Taylor. No hands 
are raised...

               TAYLOR
     Well, then, I guess there's only one 
     thing to do.

               DORN
     What's that?

               TAYLOR
     Win the whole fuckin' thing.

We take CUTS of the startled faces of the players. As the 
idea sinks in, they begin to come to life. MUSIC begins and 
we're into a...

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

detailing the newly-motivated Indians' drive for the pennant 
and the "Pennant Fever" it creates in Cleveland. We begin 
with...

BROWN

hanging a full size blowup of Rachel Phelps on the locker 
room wall. In the picture she's pointing as if out at the 
players, and a bubble above her head says, "YOU GUYS STINK!" 
A set of designer clothes, of the type Rachel wears, have 
been superimposed on the picture. The clothes are divided 
into 32 pull-off squares.

               BROWN
     I figure it's gonna take 32 more 
     victories to win this thing. Every 
     time we win, we peel a square.

HAYES

coming out of an elevator in the Turk, with a wheelbarrow 
full of dirt. We pan him down the hall, where we see a dirt 
sliding area he's been building up.

HAYES

leading off a makeshift base in the hall of the Turk. As 
Vaughn tosses a ball up in the air, Hayes takes off down the 
hall toward another base on the dirt sliding area.

Vaughn catches the ball and rifles a throw down to Taylor, 
who puts the tag on the sliding Hayes. Cerrano, who's umping, 
calls Hayes out. Hayes jumps up and argues vociferously, 
hopping around in frustration.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

PEPPER

hitting one rocket-shot ground ball after another at Dorn. 
Some bounce off his chest and arms, but Dorn stays in front 
of every one.

DORN

taking off his shirt in the locker room. His chest is a mass 
of welts and bruises.

CERRANO

"polishing" his bats with black shoe polish and a brush.

TAYLOR

taking batting practice late at night. He attacks the ball 
swing after swing.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

VAUGHN

taking his stretch with a man on first, and firing to the 
plate. The Batter swings and misses for strike three, while 
the Runner on first breaks for second. TAYLOR rifles a throw 
down to second nailing the Runner for a double play.

DORN

taking a hot smash off his chest. He picks it up and guns 
the runner down.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

HAYES

stealing home, as the opposing Pitcher tries frantically to 
hurry his windup. Hayes slides across safely, hooking to the 
infield side. He jumps up and punches the air with his fist.

HAYES

nailing up the pair of black gloves he used to steal home 
above his bed.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Ross Farmer, microphone in hand, stands in front of a blazing 
bonfire. A large crowd cheers as various people throw doormats 
on the blaze.

               FARMER
          (to TV camera)
     You remember bra burning in the '70's, 
     well, the newest thing in Cleveland 
     is doormat burning as Indian fans 
     are standing up and saying "We won't 
     be stepped on anymore".

THREE QUICK SHOTS OF VAUGHN

blowing fast balls by hitter.

RACHEL

with Donovan next to her, watching all this good play in 
disgust.

AN ANGEL HITTER

lining a single to center. Cerrano charges it and fires to 
the plate as a Runner tries to score from second. Just as 
Taylor catches the ball, he's once again knocked flat by the 
Runner. This time he lies still a beat, and then an arm comes 
up holding the ball.

The Umpire thumbs the Runner out.

TAYLOR

late at night, sitting head-down in the outboard motor 
whirlpool. He's hurting.

EXT. CLEVELAND DOWNTOWN STREET -DAY

We PICK UP three Teenage Girls walking down the street wearing 
T-shirts that say WILD THING--I THINK I LOVE YOU. A Black 
Kid comes by wearing black gloves on each hand. As he passes, 
he holds up one finger signifying Number One. The Girls return 
the signal.

EXT. EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

The Business Executive passes his secretary's desk, gives 
her some instructions, and goes into his office. As soon as 
he's out of sight, she opens her drawer and slips the earplug 
from a portable radio into her ear. OVER, we hear the Indians' 
BROADCAST.

THE EXECUTIVE

inside his office. He opens his desk drawer and pulls out an 
earplug. He's also listening to the game.

SERIES OF SHOTS

of squares of leopard skin fabric being peeled away. Under

breast and arm.

THE INDIAN TEAM

all dressed in tuxedos, posed "team picture" style on the 
infield of Municipal Stadium.

               TEAM
          (in unison)
     Hello, do you know us?

               TAYLOR
     We're a Major League baseball team, 
     but since we haven't won a pennant 
     in thirty years, nobody recognizes 
     us, not even in our own hometown.

               VAUGHN
     That's why we carry the American 
     Express card. No matter how far out 
     of first we are, it keeps us from 
     getting shut out at our favorite 
     hotels and restaurants.

               CERRANO
     So if you're looking for some big 
     league clout, apply for the little 
     green home run hitter.

               TAYLOR
     Look what it's done for us. People 
     still don't recognize us, but...
          (whispering)
     ...we're in the first division now.

HAYES

sliding across home plate in his tuxedo and stopping IN FRAME. 
He holds up an American Express card in a black-gloved hand.

               HAYES
     The American Express card. Don't 
     steal home without it.

SHOTS OF FANS

filing into Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Tickets being ripped, 
programs sold, etc.

TAYLOR

swinging and hitting a home run into the left field seats.

THE BLEACHER BAND

beating the tom-toms and whooping it up. The SHOT WIDENS to 
reveal they're no longer alone in the stands.

HAYES

nailing up another pair of gloves above his head. There are 
a lot of them up there now.

INT. THE INDIAN BUS - NIGHT

On the road again. Everyone's asleep except Taylor who lies 
across his seat, heating pads on his knees.

THE LONGSHOREMEN (POSSIBLE OMIT)

watching TV in a Cleveland working-class bar. Also cheering 
the Indians are several punk and heavy metal kids, their 
faces painted with Indian war paint. Strange bedfellows.

CERRANO

hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof.

DONOVAN

standing up to cheer Cerrano's homer, then remembering he's 
with Rachel. He sits down apologetically. Rachel watches the 
events on the field with a face of cold steel.

TAYLOR

hitting a double into the right centerfield alley with two 
runners on.

Hayes, the trailing runner, catches up with the lead runner, 
and they reach the plate at about the same time, one sliding 
around the Catcher one way, one around the other.

Both score as the Catcher tries to tag both and gets neither.

FANS IN THE STANDS

going wild, while the Indian mascot dances on top of the 
dugout.

TV SCREEN

The program in progress is suddenly interrupted by a Sports-
Break logo appearing on the screen.

               VOICE
     We interrupt this program to bring 
     you the following special bulletin.

ROSS FARMER

live outside the Indian's locker room. He wears a headdress, 
warpaint, and a Wild Thing T-shirt.

               FARMER
     Good evening, everybody. The 
     incredible has happened. The Indians 
     have finished the regular season in 
     a first place tie with the New York 
     Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win 
     over the Tigers in Detroit today. 
     There will be a one-game playoff 
     here in Cleveland the day after 
     tomorrow to decide the Eastern 
     Division Championship, the Indians 
     having won the coin flip held just 
     moments ago in the American League 
     office. We'll have further details 
     on the news at 11, but for now, get 
     your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.

CLOSEUP - A PIECE OF LEOPARD SKIN FABRIC

We hear cheers as it's ripped away to reveal the photographic 
image of Rachel's cleavage. We PULL BACK to see the life-
size poster is now completely peeled. Rachel stares out at 
us in a G-string and tassels. The photo is obviously from 
her showgirl days.

General merriment prevails in the locker room. Players shaking 
hands, back slapping, etc. Hayes comes by to exchange 
congratulations with Taylor. MUSIC and MONTAGE END.

               HAYES
     Hey, not bad for a has-been and a 
     never-will-be.

               TAYLOR
     We haven't won anything yet. We still 
     got one more to go.

Dorn comes by Taylor's locker.

               DORN
     Hey, Taylor, there's a coupla drop-
     dead Annies outside. One of 'em says 
     she used to know you pretty good. 
     Brunette, great rack...

               TAYLOR
     Darla.

               DORN
     Yeh. What doya say we chat 'em up?

               TAYLOR
          (without much 
                              enthusiasm)
     I don't know...

               DORN
     C'mon, you're not gonna keep moonin' 
     over that library chick, are you? 
     Forget her, she's gone.

We leave Taylor thinking it over.

INT. DORN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Suzanne Dorn is watching the 11 o'clock news. HAL CHARLES is 
holding forth.

               CHARLES
     The Indians are spending the night 
     in Detroit and will bus back to 
     Cleveland in the morning. We're going 
     to go back now to Ross Farmer who's 
     standing by at the Hotel Stanley 
     where the Indians are staying in 
     Detroit. Ross?

The scene shifts to...

THE LOBBY OF THE STANLEY HOTEL

where Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand. Behind him 
several players can be seen partying in the bar.

               FARMER
     Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the 
     Indians are in high spirits tonight, 
     looking forward to their showdown 
     with the Yankees. Who will start 
     that game is still a matter of some 
     conjecture.

As Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background 
with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and 
hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. 
Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen 
to get a better look.

Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously 
going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off 
button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face 
begins to harden.

INT. TAYLOR'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Taylor and DARLA are undressing, preparatory to getting into 
bed. They are definitely no strangers to each other.

               DARLA
     You still got that black Corvette? 
     The one that the sound system took 
     up the whole trunk?

               TAYLOR
     No, I had to sell it.

               DARLA
     I thought they gave them to ya.

               TAYLOR
     Not after your knees go bad.

               DARLA
     That's all right, you'll be gettin' 
     a new one now.

Darla is down to her bra and panties. She puts her leg up on 
the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off 
his pants, but stops.

               TAYLOR
     Darla, I don't think I can do this.

               DARLA
     What do you mean? We did this between 
     innings once.

               TAYLOR
     I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.

Darla looks at him a long beat.

               DARLA
          (resigned)
     Happens to the best of them sooner 
     or later. What's her name?

EXT. HALL OUTSIDE TAYLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT

The door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now. She 
turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested.

               DARLA
     So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna 
     devote a whole chapter to you in my 
     book.

As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens 
across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled 
by the sight of Taylor and Darla together.

               LYNN
     Excuse me. I was in town for a 
     conference and thought I'd drop by, 
     but I can see you're busy...

With that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the 
doors close.

               TAYLOR
     Lynn, wait...

Taylor leaps to the elevator door, but it's too late. He 
then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.

TAYLOR

running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign 
of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out 
in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into 
the night.

INT. THE INDIANS' BUS - DAY

We PICK UP Vaughn making his way to the back of the bus, 
where Brown has his "office" on the last seat. Most of the 
other players are asleep after a late night of partying.

               VAUGHN
     You wanted to see me?

               BROWN
     Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you 
     that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow 
     against the Yankees, even though 
     it's your turn in the rotation.

Vaughn says nothing, but he's clearly disappointed.

               BROWN
     He's got more experience and a little 
     better record against the Yankees.

               VAUGHN
     Yeh, sure. Whatever's best for the 
     team.

               BROWN
     Don't read anything into it, Rick. 
     You're one of the guys that got us 
     here.

               VAUGHN
     Yeh, okay.

Vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle. Brown watches him 
go, knowing he's still upset.

EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY

The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group 
of several thousand fans wait. The players are showered with 
cheers and applause as they file out.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Vaughn sits in the bar alone, nursing a beer, still troubled 
by his demotion. He hears a sexy VOICE behind him.

               VOICE
     You mind if I join you?

Vaughn turns around to see Suzanne Dorn. She's dressed to 
draw blood, looking better than we've ever seen her. She 
slides into the booth.

               VAUGHN
     I don't think I'd be very good company 
     tonight.

               SUZANNE
     Why not?

               VAUGHN
     Nothin'. Job problem.

Vaughn falls silent. Suzanne stares at him with a devastating 
combination of sexual heat and tender admiration. She's 
pulling out all the stops. Vaughn's a little flustered.

               VAUGHN
     I'm, ah, a ball player.

               SUZANNE
     I know, but that's not why I came 
     over. I don't chase ball players.

               VAUGHN
     Why did you come over then?

               SUZANNE
     Because you're the sexiest man I've 
     ever laid eyes on, and you look like 
     you could use a... friend.

We GO TO Vaughn. Forget it. He's a goner.

INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Vaughn has dozed off in the bed. Suzanne, is getting dressed. 
Vaughn wakes up as she finishes.

               VAUGHN
     Where you goin'?

               SUZANNE
     I've gotta get home.

               VAUGHN
     I didn't even get your name.

               SUZANNE
     Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn

               VAUGHN
          (having heard that 
                              name someplace before)
     Suzanne Dorn?

               SUZANNE
     Mrs. Suzanne Dorn.
          (kissing him on the 
                              forehead)
     So long. You're a great kid.

With that she walks on out, leaving Vaughn dazed by the 
knowledge of who he's just slept with.

THE HALL OUTSIDE VAUGHN'S ROOM

Taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as 
Suzanne comes out of Vaughn's room.

               SUZANNE
          (nonchalant)
     Hello, Jake.

               TAYLOR
     Hello, Suzanne.

Taylor is amazed by what he's just seen. As soon as Suzanne 
is out of sight, he goes to Vaughn's room and opens the door.

               TAYLOR
     Vaughn?

Vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief.

               VAUGHN
     I swear to God I didn't know who she 
     was.

Taylor nods that it's all right even though he doesn't believe 
it.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE LIMO

pulling up outside the church. Lynn is helped out of the car 
by her Father. As she starts up the steps, she sees that 
both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in 
uniform. They form an arch of bats as she passes. At the top 
of the steps is Taylor. Lynn stops as her father ushers her 
mother on into the church.

               TAYLOR
     You look beautiful.

               LYNN
     Thank you. I didn't think you'd come.

               TAYLOR
     I can't stay.
          (indicating the team)
     We gotta get to the park.

               LYNN
     Good luck today, Jake.

               TAYLOR
     Yeh, you too.
          (pause)
     Tell me one thing. The night you 
     came up to my hotel -- was there 
     really a library conference?

               LYNN
     No, I came to see you.

               TAYLOR
     Too bad it didn't work out better. I 
     just wanna say I'm sorry for all the 
     things I've put you through over the 
     years.

               LYNN
     Even for last night?

               TAYLOR
     Can't be sorry for that. Nothing 
     happened.

He says this with absolute conviction. Despite herself, Lynn 
senses that he's telling the truth.

               LYNN
     Then you weren't defending my honor 
     again?

               TAYLOR
     I didn't have to. She knew she was 
     outclassed.

Lynn smiles. He gives her a kiss and watches as she goes 
inside. He stands there a long beat, then turns and walks 
slowly down the steps past his teammates.

INT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY

Rachel is looking out at the empty stadium. There's a KNOCK 
at the door.

               RACHEL
     Come in.

The door is opened by a Male Secretary and in steps Lou Brown.

               RACHEL
     Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya?

Lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk.

               BROWN
     I wanted to hand in my resignation 
     before you had a chance to fire me.

               RACHEL
     What do you mean?

               BROWN
     I know what you been tryin' to do 
     with this team. After the season, I 
     want no part of it.

               RACHEL
     Well, I knew I could count on Charlie 
     to tell somebody. I was just afraid 
     he might take too long.

               BROWN
     Why would you want him to tell 
     somebody?

               RACHEL
     So you'd tell the team, hopefully 
     getting them mad enough to knock 
     themselves out trying to prove they 
     belonged in this league. I think it 
     worked.

               BROWN
     You tryin' to make me believe you 
     wanted us to win all along?

Rachel nods.

               BROWN
     Bullshit. What about the plane, the 
     bus, the bad hotels...

               RACHEL
     We were broke. We couldn't afford 
     anything better. Donald left the 
     team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had 
     another losing season, I would have 
     had to sell the team. I knew we 
     couldn't win with the team we had, 
     so I decided to bring in new players 
     and see how they'd do with the proper 
     motivation. There was never any offer 
     from Miami. I made it all up.

               BROWN
     Why should I believe any of this? 
     Now that we're winnin' it's easy for 
     you to jump on the bandwagon.

               RACHEL
     If I'd really wanted you to lose, 
     all I had to do was send the best 
     players back to the minors. But I 
     didn't, did I?

Brown has no comeback for this. He knows now that she's 
telling the truth.

               RACHEL
     You think this was all an accident? 
     I personally scouted every member of 
     this team, except Hayes, of course. 
     He was a surprise. They all had flaws 
     which concealed their real talent, 
     or I wouldn't have been able to get 
     them. But I knew if anyone could 
     straighten them out, you could. And 
     if you tell them any of this, I will 
     fire you.

Brown can only shake his head at this whole thing.

               RACHEL
     I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em 
     tonight.

The two shake hands. Brown looks at Rachel a beat, still 
looking for some sign of duplicity. Finally he gives her a 
grudging smile of respect.

INT. THE TURK - LATE AFTERNOON

Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are getting ready to 
board the bus to the stadium. Taylor pulls Vaughn aside.

               TAYLOR
     I don't know what Dorn's wife is up 
     to, but I think it'd be best if you 
     dressed early and got out to the 
     bullpen before Dorn comes in.

Vaughn nods.

               HAYES
          (to Taylor)
     We got a problem. Cerrano wants some 
     extra power for tonight. He's lookin' 
     to sacrifice a live chicken. We can't 
     have people pukin' in the locker 
     room before the game.

               TAYLOR
     Tell him not to worry, I'll take 
     care of it.

INT. DORN'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Dorn is ready to leave for the park.

               DORN
     Bye bye, honey, wish me luck.

               SUZANNE
     Before you go, there's something I 
     wanta tell you.

Uh oh, we know what this is all about.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - NIGHT

The place is jammed. 75,000 screaming maniacs, most of them 
decked out in war paint and head dresses. Some carry plastic 
scalps with Yankee hats on them. Others have caps with the 
European "No" insignia superimposed over a door mat.

DOYLE

In the press box.

               COLORMAN
     Here's your bourbon.

               DOYLE
     Won't need it tonight.

THE LOCKER ROOM

starkly quiet in contrast to the stadium outside. Each player 
has retreated into his own world of concentration.

Dorn approaches Taylor, who's fitting heavy athletic braces 
on both knees.

               DORN
     You know where Vaughn is?

               TAYLOR
     Nope. Haven't seen him.

               DORN
     Let me know if you do. I wanna have 
     a little talk with him.

Dorn moves off.

               CERRANO
     Where's my chicken?

               TAYLOR
     It's comin' in now.

We see a Bat Boy enter with a bucket of fried chicken. Cerrano 
looks at it in bewilderment.

               TAYLOR
     One whole chicken, like you said.

               CERRANO
     But it no alive.

               TAYLOR
     Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this. 
     He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw 
     chicken.

As Cerrano hefts the bucket somewhat skeptically and takes 
it to his altar, we...

                                   CUT TO:

HARRIS

warming up in the bullpen. The tension of starting such an 
important game shows in his face.

               DOYLE
     Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding 
     you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful 
     Municipal Stadium, where tonight 
     before a capacity crowd of 75,000 
     screaming featherheads, the braves 
     of the Cuyahoga will leave their 
     teepees in search of Cleveland's 
     first League Championship in over 30 
     years. Standing in the way, their 
     long time nemesis, the New York 
     Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway, 
     who have beaten the Indians like a 
     tom-tom all year long.

Down in the dugout, the players are lined up ready to take 
the field. They exchange words of encouragement, hand slaps, 
clenched fists, but all at a very low key level. This is 
tension time.

               BROWN
     All right, guys, let's take it to 
     'em.

The Indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation.

In the center field bleachers Thelma's victory blanket 
containing the scores of every Indian game for the season, 
hangs from a railing. Bobby, Vic and Johnny pound the tom-
toms leading the stadium in a monster version of "In the 
Land of Burning Waters." Even the groundskeepers join in.

Two down in the first. Harris looking sharp so far... Bouncing 
ball to third. Dorn up with it.

HARRIS

Throwing the first pitch. The YANKEE HITTER grounds one to 
Dorn who throws him out.

THE SCOREBOARD

0-0 in the 3rd.

CERRANO

striking out on a curve ball.

HAYES

robbing a Yankee of a home run by making a leaping catch 
over the fence.

TAYLOR

picking a Yankee runner off first.

THE SCOREBOARD

0-0 in the 5th.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

CERRANO

striking out on a curve ball, trying to check his swing. 
Umpire emphatically punches him out.

DOYLE

Looking past him to the field. Harris is on the mound. There's 
a runner on second.

               DOYLE
     Still nothing -- nothing, top of the 
     seventh, two down. Harris has been 
     in trouble all night, but has battled 
     his way out with the help of some 
     great defensive plays.

Harris comes set and delivers. The Yankee hitter, BURTON, 
(L) swings and gets all of it.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Uh oh, this one's tagged. Deep center 
     field. Way back. Way back.

Hayes climbs up on the wall, but it's long gone. Home run.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     It's off the reservation, home run. 
     And the Yankees lead it 2-0.

RACHEL'S BOX (INSERT STORYBOARD # 209G)

               RACHEL
     Shit.

Donovan is a little confused by this.

Burton trots around the bases and is greeted by jubilant 
teammates at the plate. A silent pall falls on the stadium. 
As the "2" goes up on the scoreboard, we...

                                   CUT TO:

HAYES

popping up and flinging his bat away in frustration. We take 
CUTS of the worried fans, chewing fingernails, wadding up 
programs, hanging their heads, etc.

TAYLOR

grounding out, obviously having trouble running. We take 
CUTS of worried faces on the bench.

DORN

stepping into the batter's box. The crowd is practically 
sitting on its hands now. Hope draining away.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the 
     seventh. The Indians running out of 
     chances.

Dorn swings at the first pitch and lines a sharp single to 
left. The crowd and the Indian bench suddenly come alive. 
Cerrano moves to the plate.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     That'll bring on Cerrano, hitless 
     tonight. As a matter of fact, he 
     hasn't touched the ball yet.

The crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his 
lead. Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses. An audible 
groan goes through the crowd.

The Yankee pitcher gets set again, and throws Cerrano a big, 
roundhouse curve. He misses it a foot. Strike two.

               BROWN
     Damn, havin' trouble with the curve 
     ball again.

               HAYES
     We should've gotten him a live 
     chicken.

Cerrano steps out and begins to talk to his bat, gesturing 
and pointing as if arguing with his wife.

               CERRANO
     I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to 
     you, I stand up for you. If you no 
     help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu. 
     I do it myself.

Cerrano gets back in the box and digs in. The Yankee pitcher 
comes to his stretch and delivers. Another big breaking curve 
ball. Cerrano swings and knocks the crap out of it. Everyone 
in the stands and on the bench jumps to their feet, rooting 
for the ball to get out.

DOYLE (STORYBOARD #212EE)

               DOYLE
     Long drive, deep centerfield. Way 
     back. It might be. It could be. The 
     ball is... Downtown, welcome to the 
     Happy Hunting Ground. The game is 
     tied.

The fans go crazy as Cerrano circles the bases.

RACHEL'S BOX (STORYBOARD # 212GG)

Rachel jumps out of her seat, hands above her head. Donovan 
hesitates a beat, then follows suit.

Cerrano carries his bat with him, holding it high above his 
head. As Cerrano disappears into the dugout, we go to the 
scoreboard as the 2 goes up.

DOYLE (STORYBOARD # 212NN)

               DOYLE
     Two down in the top of the ninth, 
     still tied at 2, Harris working on 
     an eight-hitter.

                                   CUT TO:

YANKEE HITTER

lining a single to right field. Harris mops his brow, 
obviously tiring.

ANOTHER YANKEE HITTER

smashing a double off the wall, the lead runner stopping at 
third. Brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm.

HARRIS

on the mound, looking like he's out of gas.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Activity continues in the pen, as 
     Harris is really digging himself a 
     hole now. He got the first two 
     hitters, and then gave up a single 
     and a double and has now gone 3-0 to 
     Cheevers.

Harris comes set and fires to the plate. It's way high.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     High, ball four and they're loaded 
     for Haywood, the biggest Indian killer 
     of them all.

Brown has seen enough. He makes his way to the mound.

               BROWN
          (taking the ball from 
                              Harris)
     You pitched a hell of a game, Steve. 
     Take a seat and we'll see if we can 
     get this guy for ya.

Brown signals to the bullpen with his left hand.

               BROWN
     Give me Vaughn.

               TAYLOR
          (surprised)
     You want Vaughn?

               BROWN
     I know he hasn't done real well 
     against this guy, but I got a hunch 
     he's due.

VAUGHAN

striding in from the bullpen. He doesn't look relaxed. As he 
nears the infield he purposely doesn't look at Dorn. Dorn 
stares at him with undisguised venom.

As Vaughan gets to the mound, he sees Patton getting his 
convict uniform on in the Yankee dugout. He looks away to 
see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him.

Meanwhile, the CROWD has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn. 
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out "Wild Thing" on the 
tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing 
it. Doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do 
it's work.

               BROWN
     Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard 
     stuff in. Curve him on the hands, 
     bust him away, and don't get up with 
     anything. You listenin' to me Rick?

Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested 
any of that.

               BROWN
          (Patting him on the 
                              butt)
     O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go 
     get him.

               TAYLOR
     C'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you 
     been waitin' your whole life for.

Brown and Taylor leave Vaughn alone on the mound, the SINGING 
of the crowd ringing in his ears.

DOYLE (INSERT STORYBOARD #216N)

               DOYLE
     O.K. Vaughn has finished his warmup 
     and we're ready to...

No sooner has Taylor settled in behind the plate, than Dorn 
starts toward the mound. Vaughn watches him come with fear 
and trepidation.

               TAYLOR
          (seeing it)
     Oh, shit.

Dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the 
ball. Vaughn gives it to him. Dorn rubs it up, staring long 
and hard into Vaughn's eyes. Vaughn is sweating bullets. 
Finally Dorn speaks.

               DORN
     Let's cut through the crap. I only 
     got one thing to say to you. Just 
     rear back and strike this motherfucker 
     out.

He smiles and hands Vaughn the ball back. Vaughn returns the 
smile and accepts the ball. While Dorn trots back to his 
position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last 
moment of concentration. As he turns around to face us, we 
see a new man as the wicked opening CHORDS of X's "Wild Thing" 
are heard on the TRACK, only louder and more savage than 
before.

Vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce 
resolve. There's nothing nervous about him now. This kid is 
gonna make somebody pay.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Haywood steps in, the American League 
     triple crown winner. .341 average, 
     48 homers, 121 R.B.I.'s. He's homered 
     the only two times he's faced Vaughn.

Taylor sets down a sign. Two fingers for the curve ball. 
Vaughn shakes it off. Taylor puts down another sign. Vaughn 
shakes it off. Finally, Taylor puts down one finger -- the 
fast ball. Vaughn nods with steely purpose.

               TAYLOR
     All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.

Vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate. 
Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. Strike one.

We see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the 
SPEED GUN which a club employee holds behind the screen.

               TAYLOR
          (to Haywood)
     All right, looks like the boy is 
     pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't 
     it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two 
     foot hole comin' out.

Taylor gets ready to flash another sign. The convict jumps 
up and down trying to distract Vaughn. No way.

               TAYLOR
          (for Haywood's ears)
     Let's see, what should we call now. 
     Let's see how he feels about old 
     number one.

Taylor puts down one finger. Vaughn nods and then winds and 
fires again, another blazing rocket. Haywood takes a wicked 
rip, but doesn't get it. Strike two. 99 comes up on the gun. 
The convict has stopped jumpin'.

               TAYLOR
     Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow-
     through. Keep it up, I'll show you 
     the ball sometime.

The fans are going wild. They're all standing now, yelling 
for a strikeout. Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the 
look of an animal sighting prey. Taylor gets down to give 
the sign.

DUGOUT (INSERT STORYBOARD # 216R)

               BROWN
     Forget the curveball. Go with the 
     heater.

               TAYLOR
     Well, shit, all these pitches to 
     choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin' 
     different this time.

Taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big 
No. 1. Vaughn gives him a quick nod.

               TAYLOR
     And if I don't see you again, Haywood, 
     have a nice winter. Okay, buddy?

Vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet 
toward the plate. Haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already 
by him. Strike three. 101 on the gun. Taylor leaps up and 
gives Vaughn the fist. The fans are going berserk. MUSIC 
ends.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters 
     and the Yankees are blown down. No 
     runs, two hits, three left on, and, 
     are you ready, Cleveland? We go to 
     the bottom of the ninth, still tied 
     at two.

Doyle turns the mike off.

               DOYLE
          (to his color man)
     Can you believe this, Monty?

Monty takes a big swig straight from the bourbon bottle.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

ANOTHER INDIAN HITTER

grounding out to short.

HAYES

walking up to the plate.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Two down in the ninth, Hayes steps 
     in hitting .291, trying to get 
     something going for the Tribe.

Taylor and the others yell encouragement to Hayes as he digs 
in at the plate. The Yankee pitcher delivers and Hayes hits 
a high bouncer toward short. The shortstop waits for it to 
come down and then fires to first. Too late. Hayes streaks 
across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. Once again the 
CROWD comes to life.

The Yankee Manager comes to the mound and waves for a new 
pitcher.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     And Horton is wasting no time. He's 
     goin' to the Duke.

Out of the pen comes BILLY DUKE, a good facsimile of Goose 
Gossage only Duke is bigger and meaner.

(INSERT STORYBOARD #219M)

               DOYLE
     Duke leads the league in saves, 
     strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.

The Duke finishes his warmups and stares over at Hayes. Hayes 
smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and 
carefully pulls them on over his hands.

The Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship.

Brown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke 
from the on-deck circle.

               BROWN
     Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch-
     hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 
     against Duke. Plus you're beat to 
     shit you can hardly walk, there's no 
     way you can get around on this guy's 
     fast ball. So I want the absolute 
     truth here. Can you beat this guy?

               TAYLOR
     Yeh.

               BROWN
     Okay.

Taylor starts for the plate, as Duke finishes his warmups. 
Brown comes down the dugout steps.

               BROWN
          (to Pepper)
     Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't 
     want Taylor takin' too many strikes.

Pepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on 
the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching 
low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman 
slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back.

The crowd is on its feet again. The "GO" chant starts, 
punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the 
night air.

Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, 
checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and 
comes to the plate.

Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. 
Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up 
throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Hayes 
leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman snaps 
down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there.

The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound. 
Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.

               PEPPER
     What's he doing?

               BROWN
     Flashing some signals. That's a hell 
     of an idea.

Brown flashes a sign out to Hayes. A hint of a smile comes 
over Hayes' face as he dusts himself off.

Taylor steps back in as Duke gets up on the rubber. Taylor 
digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers 
ala Babe Ruth.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     What's this? Taylor is pointing to 
     the bleachers, calling his shot.

The crowd, electrified by Taylor's gesture, remains on its 
feet. Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and 
then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head. 
Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by 
inches. The stadium explodes with BOOS, but as soon as Taylor 
picks himself up, the crowd begins to ROAR again.

Bobby, Vic and Johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the 
TOM-TOMS. Everyone in the stadium begins to CLAP in unison 
with the DRUMS.

Taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
          (Taylor points again)
     Unbelievable. They're on their feet 
     here, stomping, clapping. C'mon, 
     join in wherever you are out there. 
     Let's hear you, Cleveland.

THE LONGSHOREMEN

and several of their friends at their bar, huddled around 
the RADIO with the punks and heavy metal kids we saw before. 
Slowly they begin to clap in time with the tom-toms which 
are audible on the T.V.

THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE

at the opera with his wife, a radio earplug in his ear. His 
hand taps on his leg in sync with the TOM-TOMS.

THE TWO KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS

(Sc 222 before scene 221) beating on their shovels in the 
bullpen.

LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING

FRAMED against the Cleveland skyline. In several of the lit 
windows we see people banging things or clapping.

THE STADIUM AGAIN

Duke gets back on the hill. Getting the sign he wants, he 
comes to his stretch, checking Hayes at second.

As Duke starts his delivery to the plate, we go to SLOW 
MOTION. The clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes 
to watch the pitch. We...

                                   CUT TO:

THE LONGSHOREMEN, THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE, THE GROUNDSKEEPERS 
AND THE APARTMENT DWELLERS

They've all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch.

THE STADIUM

Everything from here on will continue to be in SLOW MOTION. 
As Duke whips his arm toward the plate, Hayes takes off for 
third. Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the 
bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.

The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges 
the ball frantically.

TAYLOR

barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving 
it everything he's got.

THE THIRD BASEMAN

scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to 
first.

TAYLOR

pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee 
first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor 
and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the 
bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.

The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe. 
Taylor's beaten it.

The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes 
fear into his heart across the field. It's...

HAYES

streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second 
on a bunt.

The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions 
himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet-
first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to 
the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.

               DOYLE (V.O.)
     Hayes is gonna try to score! Here 
     comes the throw. He slides. He is...

Hayes' foot catches the corner of the plate. The umpire puts 
the palms down and whips them apart. It's all over, folks. 

SLOW MOTION ENDS

               DOYLE
     ...Safe. The Indians win it. The 
     Indians win. Oh my God, the Indians 
     win it!!

Pandemonium breaks loose in Municipal Stadium. Rachel hugs 
Donovan, dances around, punches the air, then hugs Donovan 
again. Everywhere people are hugging and kissing each other. 
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are going berserk in the bleachers. 
Thelma sits quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek.

QUICK CUTS

of our other fans. We see...

A) The Business Executive stand up and yell "Yes!" in the 
middle of the opera. Several other men stand up and express 
their excitement as well.

B) The Longshoremen whoop it up in their bar -- exchanging 
fives and hugs with the punkers and heavy metal kids.

C) The various apartment dwellers dancing, clapping, yelling 
out the windows.

D) The two Korean Groundskeepers just shaking their heads in 
amazement.

E) Elsewhere in the stadium, the joyous exultation continues 
unabated. The crowd pours onto the field as Hayes runs toward 
Taylor and literally leaps into his arms.

F) The two spin around throwing their fists in the air.

G) Cerrano and Harris embrace. Dorn gives Vaughn a hug, then 
steps back and decks him with a right hand.

H) Dorn pulls Vaughn back to his feet, and they hug again.

I) Up in the stands, Rachel watches all this with tears in 
her eyes.

Taylor starts off the field when he sees something that 
catches his eye. Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She 
holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it. 
Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and 
hugs herself to him. We HOLD on the celebration as it swirls 
all around them, and...
