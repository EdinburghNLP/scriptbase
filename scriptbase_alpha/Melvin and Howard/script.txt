FADE IN 

TITLES 

1     WATERHOLE - STONEWALL PASS, NEVADA - LATE DAY 

The desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah, nothing but sage
and greasewood.  Sound in the distance, a motor.  It comes
closer then fades, comes closer, fades.

Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound.  It
approaches again, a figure appears in the distance.


2     ON THE MOTORCYCLE

Only the rider's back, silver-streaked hair.  This gaunt figure 
circles lazily in the moonlight, motorcycle tires rumbling over
the alkali.  The circles get bigger and now bigger, and as he
comes around this time, the moonlight catches his face, aristo-
cratic cheekbones, a stringy beard, a pilot's light windbreaker. 
This is Howard, age 62, looks over 70.


3     ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

sweeping under the moon, wider and wider and now he speeds 
towards the waterhole, giving the Harley full throttle.


4      ON THE WATERHOLE 

A knoll running up to the edge of it.


5     ON HOWARD 

heading straight for the knoll, the chopper kicking up sage
and greasewood and alkali behind it.  Tremendous speed -- it
hits the knoll.


6     ON THE MOTORCYCLE

Howard flying through the air, his knees clutched around the
machine, his eyes wide with joy, laughter ringing through the 
desert.

The motorcycle clears the waterhole on the leap, Howard snug
in the saddle, lands in the mud on the other side, skids,
churns, the tires spitting mud, now he rolls out on the
desert again.


7     ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

sweeping into a figure eight, testing his motor now, picking 
up speed once more, heading straight for the knoll.


8     ON THE KNOLL 

The motorcycle invisible, only the sound blasting through the 
night, louder, louder, and now the motorcycle hits the top of
the knoll.  A rock, a stone, something, it kicks, it stutters, 
it flies short.


9     ON HOWARD 

His face exactly the same as before, exultation at the leap, 
but there is no motorcycle under him now, only air.


10     ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD 

His momentum carrying him over the water and he lands with a 
crunch on the other side, his head hits the mud, a flare of 
blood spurts from his ear.


11      HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW 

His eye catching sight of his motorcycle fluttering down, 
landing with a splash, bubbling as it disappears into the
waterhole. 

TITLES OUT


12     EXT. DESERT - DUSK - ON HOWARD

picking himself up, stumbling across the desert, nothing but 
silence around him, his feet kicking over the alkali.  He 
trips, rights himself, moves on.


13     ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

faltering, falling.

He picks himself up, his face scratched, his lips crusted 
with saliva, blood caked around his ear.


14     HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW 

Way in the distance, the headlights of a car.


15     ON HOWARD 

He starts to raise his hand, almost furtively, but then he
draws it back.  He does not want to wave.

He looks towards the moon, spins once like a shot-putter. 
Now he falls.

The headlights pass on down the Interstate.  Darkness.


16     EXT. NEVADA HIGHWAY - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 

Two headlights, one dimmer and more yellow than the other, 
are coming down the Interstate now.  Sound -- a man singing. 
The song is horrible, the voice joyous.

               MELVIN (v.o.) 
          (singing) 
     'Well, he called his elves together 
     To soup up his old sleigh 
     So Rudolph and the other reindeer 
     Could rest on Christmas Day....'


17     INT. CAR - NIGHT - ON MELVIN DUMMAR

a face with no secrets, a cowlick and sideburns, looking 
younger than his thirties; Montgomery Ward pants and a 
shirt with cowboy roses.

               MELVIN 
          (singing) 
     'He's got a million miles to travel
     And he'll do it in one day 
     Oh that's because old Santa Claus 
     Got a souped-up Santa sleigh.'

The song trails off into a hum as Melvin pulls off onto the 
side of the road.


18      ON MELVIN 

undoing his fly.  As he reaches into his pants, the sound of 
a car in the distance, he quickly turns to hide himself, the 
car passes.

Now he reaches in again, but another car catches him in its 
lights.

               MELVIN 
     Jeesuz.

He climbs back into his car, stomps on the gas, and he zooms 
off the highway and on to the alkali, up an old cattle road. 
Now he scuds to a stop, steps out onto the emptiness of the 
desert.


19     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

pissing, sighing with relief, his sigh mingling with the 
crackling of his urine as it hits the desert crust.


20     ON MELVIN'S FACE

Pleasure.  The same pleasure he feels at eating, sleeping, 
defecating, copulating.

Climbs back into his car.  Starts up the motor, backs around, 
and the headlight catches a body lying in the deserted cattle
road.


21     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

blinks.  Squints, now he throws the car into low gear, rolls 
slowly towards the body, stops a few feet away.


22     ON MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

The body doesn't move.  Limp, dead.


23      ON MELVIN

following the shaft of the headlight, moving towards the body. 
Poised a step away.

Now he crouches over it.  A grunt.  Melvin rolls it over.  A 
beard, Howard's long hair.  He lifts him, the headlight shines 
full into Howard's eyes, they open, flicker.  Howard grunts
again.

               MELVIN
     Whut?

Howard doesn't stir, doesn't answer.  Melvin cradles Howard's
head, and the ear comes into view, fresh blood trickling over 
the clotting.  Melvin heaves Howard up, half-stumbling, half-
carrying him towards the car, opens the passenger side and
shovels him in.


24     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

slamming the door shut.  Now Melvin looks out towards the
desert.


25     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

Only blackness and silence.


26      ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

climbs into the car on the driver's side, looks over at his 
passenger.  Howard has scrunched himself into a corner, his 
eyes are wide open now, and wild with terror.  Melvin catches
it.

Melvin smiles, nothing from Howard.  Melvin smiles again.

               MELVIN 
     Whut's the matter, ol' buddy?

Howard doesn't answer.  He turns his head a little but as he 
turns, blood oozes.

               MELVIN
     Whut are you doin' out here?

Silence again.  Howard doesn't take his eyes off Melvin. 
Melvin leans toward him.  Howard braces himself against the
door.

               MELVIN 
          (peering into
          Howard's face)
     That ear don't look too good to me. 
     You want a doctor?

Howard shakes his head.

               MELVIN (Cont'd) 
     There's a doctor in Beatty.  That
     ain't but a few miles.  Want to go
     to Beatty?

Howard doesn't answer, just holds himself stiff against the
door.

               MELVIN 
     We'll go to Beatty.  Okay?

He throws the car into gear, spins around and heads off to-
wards the interstate.

                         
27     INT. CAR - NIGHT

Melvin at the wheel, Howard hiding in the corner of the seat 
offering Melvin as narrow a view of his face as possible. 
Suddenly a clatter, Melvin's head whips around, Howard has 
been taken with the shakes, terrible heaves, his teeth chat-
tering.

Howard doubles over trying to warm himself, clutching both 
shoulders cross-handed.  Melvin reaches for the heater, 
clicks it on, nothing happens.

               MELVIN 
     This ain't but a '66 -- damn heater
     never did work.

Howard shudders again, a terrible whistling through his teeth. 
Melvin bangs the heater with his fist.

               HOWARD
     It's okay.

               MELVIN 
     What do you mean it's okay?  Now 
     you just hold on there.

Melvin pulls over to the side of the road.


28     ON MELVIN

climbing out, opening the trunk.  The trunk light shows two 
giant plastic bags full of white powder, some horse harness, 
a bow and arrow, a fishing rod, stuffed animals and pull-toys, 
a ratty blanket and a pillow.

He fishes out the blanket and pillow.


29      TWO-SHOT - HOWARD AND MELVIN 

Melvin leans towards Howard, drapes the blanket over him, but
does not drape.  It is about the size of a shirt and the pil-
low he places under his head would fit a doll.

Howard regards them.

               MELVIN
     They belong to my little girl. Can't 
     sleep without her bumby.

Melvin laughs.

               MELVIN
     Shit.

Howard shivers, the tiny blanket falls off him. He doesn't
have the strength to pick it up,  Melvin bends over to re-
trieve it, as he does his head hits the dashboard and the 
heater whirrs on.

               MELVIN
     Well, damn!  Damn!


29-A     INT. CAR NIGHT

He laughs again.  Nothing from Howard, still underneath the
baby blanket, but now allowing his head to ease back ever so 
slightly into the pillow.

Melvin reaches his hand under the heater.

               MELVIN 
     Warm as toast!  You brought me luck,
     ol' buddy.  That heater ain't worked
     since my wife kicked it last time I 
     undressed her in the car.

Howard stirs slightly, Melvin squints over at him.  Melvin
reaches across Howard, flips open the glove compartment --
a torrent of bills and kleenex, a flashlight, half-eaten 
candy bars, some knitting needles, a pair of scissors, old 
Dixie cups.

Melvin rummages around in the mess.

               MELVIN 
     I was lookin' for a band-aid.

               HOWARD 
     Keep your eye on the road.

               MELVIN 
     How's that?

               HOWARD 
     I said keep your eye on the road.

               MELVIN 
     Well, up yours, ol' timer.

               HOWARD 
     What?

               MELVIN 
     I said 'Up yours.'

Melvin rummages some more, more papers fall out, Howard half-
tries to pick them up.

               MELVIN 
     Leave 'em.  They ain't but a bunch
     of collection notices.

He snaps the glove compartment shut, looks over at Howard's
ear.

               MELVIN 
     We ain't gonna get to Beatty any 
     too soon.

               HOWARD 
     No doctors.

               MELVIN 
     There ain't no doctors there.  Just 
     a public health nurse.

               HOWARD 
     No nurses.

               MELVIN 
     You don't like nurses? 

               HOWARD 
     No, I don't.
 
               MELVIN 
     Okay, okay. 

They ride in silence.

Howard is heaving now, Melvin watches him closely.

               HOWARD 
     I'm not going to Beatty.

               MELVIN 
     Where are you going?

               HOWARD 
     Where are you going?

               MELVIN 
     Aw, Jeezus.

               HOWARD 
     I'm sorry ---

               MELVIN 
     Don't apologize ---

               HOWARD 
     I never apologize but I'll try to 
     explain ---

               MELVIN 
     Don't explain!

               HOWARD 
     You want to stop at Beatty, fine. 
     I don't.  I'm going to Vegas ---

Howard is silent.  Melvin grits his teeth.  Howard shrugs.

               MELVIN 
     Man, you sure beat it, don't you? 
     Squirrelly ol' wino layin' out 
     there in the west 40, nobody sees 
     you 'til kingdom come -- I pick you
     up and what do you do?  Rag me.

               HOWARD 
     I'm sorry.

               MELVIN 
     What?

               HOWARD 
     Nothing. I just think I'll rest a
     while.

               MELVIN 
     You do that.  You lay back now --
     we're coming up to Beatty now --
     you still don't want to stop?

               HOWARD 
     No, no stops, please.

               MELVIN 
     You'll be sorry, you're gonna miss 
     the knockers on the public health
     nurse there.

Howard smiles.

               HOWARD 
     Nice, huh?

               MELVIN 
     Do we stop at Beatty or no?

Howard sighs. 

               HOWARD 
     No.

Melvin stomps on the gas.

               MELVIN
     Vegas, here we come. 

They drive for a long while in silence.


30     HOWARD 

is silent, always watching Melvin, shifting, shaking some, 
Melvin loose at the wheel.

               HOWARD 
     You're not a bad driver.

               MELVIN
     I been driving since I was seven 
     years old.

               HOWARD 
     How'd you reach the pedals?

               MELVIN
     Make it nine.  I had most of my
     growth by nine.

               HOWARD 
     I'll bet you did.  Jacking off in 
     that trailer.

               MELVIN
     How'd you know I lived in a trailer?

               HOWARD 
     Didn't you say so?

               MELVIN
     They was my three brothers in the 
     trailer with me.

               HOWARD 
     In one trailer?

               MELVIN 
     Two of us slept on cots and two on
     the old dinette table.  We didn't
     have nothing but an outhouse.  I 
     remember the first day I went to 
     school I peed in the water fountain.

               HOWARD 
     Interesting.

               MELVIN 
     Took me right down to the Salvation 
     Army, bought me shoes and carted me
     back to school.

               HOWARD 
     What'd you say your name was?

               MELVIN 
     Melvin Dummar.

               HOWARD 
     You're kidding me, Melvin.

Melvin smiles, looks over at Howard.

               MELVIN 
     Hey, ol' buddy.  You want to do me 
     a favor?

               HOWARD 
     Depends on what it is.

               MELVIN 
     I've written a song.

               HOWARD 
     No ---

               MELVIN 
     It's a Christmas number -- 'Santa's
     Souped-Up Sleigh.'

               HOWARD 
     Oh God.

               MELVIN 
     I sent it to Hollywood Music. 
     You know you give them the words 
     -- they write you the music --
     seventy dollars and worth every
     penny -- you want to hear it?

               HOWARD 
     No.

               MELVIN 
     Here's how it goes --
          (sings) 
     'Well, he called his elves together 
     To soup up his old sleigh 
     So Rudolph and the other reindeer 
     Could rest on Christmas Day

     'He's got a million miles to travel 
     And he'll do it in one day 
     Oh that's because old Santa Claus 
     Got a souped up Santa sleigh'

               HOWARD 
     Enough, sir ---

               MELVIN 
     Wait till you hear the talk part 
     -- a dramatic narration like Red 
     Sovine --
          (speaks)
     'Now listen there fat man
     Just because you're Santa Claus 
     That don't give you the right 
     To come around and making all
           that noise
     In the middle of the night. 
     Now I don't care who you are, 
           fat man 
     You get those reindeer off my 
           roof --'

               HOWARD 
     Please stop ---

               MELVIN 
     What's the matter?

               HOWARD 
     My ear.

               MELVIN 
     Told you we should have stopped
     at Beatty.

               HOWARD 
     It's the sound.

               MELVIN 
     What do you mean, the sound?

               HOWARD 
     Your song.

               MELVIN 
     You're cruel, man, you know that? 
     You're a cruel man.

               HOWARD 
     I have an aversion to song.

               MELVIN 
     You never sung in your life?

               HOWARD 
     Not if I could help it.

               MELVIN 
     That's how you got to be an ol' 
     asshole.  Now you come along on 
     the chorus --
          (sings)
     'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty 
           quick
     Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh 
     He'll come in like a streak of light 
     And he'll blast off right away...' 
     You got that?

               HOWARD 
     I don't know.

               MELVIN
     Now sing along with me.  Or you
     gonna walk to Vegas. 
          (sings) 
     'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty 
           quick'

Motions to Howard to join in.

               HOWARD 
          (mumbling; gingerly 
          singing) 
     Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh'

               MELVIN
     Now you're gettin' it!  Once more ---

Howard starts to sing.

               HOWARD 
          (singing) 
     'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty
           quick
     Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh....'

               MELVIN
          (speaking)
     'Now now, Mr. Fat Man, what are 
     you trying to do?  Now that 
     chimney's too small and you might 
     fall -- so you just get down off
     that roof'

Melvin points to Howard and Howard joins in.

               HOWARD AND MELVIN 
          (singing) 
     'When you hear those rockets roar 
     You'll know Santa's on his way
     But he'll be back again next year 
     In his souped up Santa's sleigh!'

Howard seems pleased with himself.

               MELVIN
     You done it!  And you want to know
     something?

               HOWARD 
     What?

               MELVIN
     You weren't bad.

               HOWARD 
     Come on.

               MELVIN
     Now you sing me one of your songs ---

               HOWARD 
     I don't know any songs ---

               MELVIN
     Anythin'.  'Stop And Smell The
     Roses,'  'My Woman, My Woman, My 
     Wife' -- whatever you like --

               HOWARD
     I don't know any songs.  My father
     was the singer in the family, 
     'When The Sunset Turns The Ocean's 
     Blue To Gold,' 'Bill Bailey.'
          (imitates)
     'Sonny, you do the verse, I'll 
     take the chorus.'  And off he'd 
     go.

               MELVIN
     What songs do you know?

               HOWARD
     Me?  Nothing --  
          (shrugs) 
     'Bye Bye Blackbird.'

               MELVIN
     There you go!

Melvin punches Howard in the arm.

               MELVIN 
     Lay it on me, ol' timer.

               HOWARD
     Don't be crazy.

               MELVIN 
     'Ladeez and gentlemen -- to wind 
     up our program tonight -- and I 
     want y'all t'drive home safely -- 
     y'hear? -- we got a brand new 
     number by an ol' ol' timer --
     he's been a pickin' and a strummin' 
     for many a year -- so let's hear it
     for this little ditty -- the ol'
     timer and "Bye Bye Blackbird!" 
     -- take it, ol' timer!!'

Howard looks at him.

               HOWARD
     Let me out.

Melvin winks.

               MELVIN 
     Come on.

Howard starts to hum a little.

               MELVIN 
     Ooh, that's nice -- did I hear a
     word?

               HOWARD
     'Bye, Bye, Blackbird.'

               MELVIN 
     There she goes.

               HOWARD
          (starting to sing 
          faintly) 
     'Pack up all my cares and woes 
     Here I go 
     Singing low'

               HOWARD AND MELVIN 
          (singing)
     'Bye, bye, blackbird!'

Howard is gaining strength.

               HOWARD 
          (singing) 
     'Where somebody waits for me 
     Sugar's sweet
     So is she'

               HOWARD AND MELVIN 
          (singing) 
     'Bye, bye, blackbird!'

Melvin turns to Howard, presenting him like an emcee.

               HOWARD 
          (singing) 
     'No one here can love and understand
           me
     Oh what hard luck stories they all
           hand me

     Make my bed and light the light
     I'll arrive
     Late tonight 
     Blackbird ---'

               MELVIN 
          (singing)
     'Blackbird!'

               HOWARD AND MELVIN 
          (singing 
          together)
     'Blackbird
     Bye!  Bye!'

Howard's face is aglow with joy, but no more so than Melvin's.

               MELVIN 
     Hey!

Melvin reaches out his hand -- Howard gives it a boogie
slap.

               MELVIN 
     I like that song -- clean up 
     that lyric a little and she'll
     take right off.

Suddenly Howard withdraws -- dim and distant.  They ride 
again in silence.

Melvin looks over to him.

               MELVIN
     How're you doin'?

               HOWARD 
     I'm fine.
          (after a moment) 
     So where are you going now?

               MELVIN 
     Home to Gabbs.  Bringin' back 
     some stuff for our trailer my 
     sister wanted to get rid of.

               HOWARD
     What do you do in Gabbs?

               MELVIN
     I work in the Mag Ox Plant.  You
     know -- Maalox -- you get an ulcer ---

               HOWARD
     I know, I know ---

               MELVIN
     You know what?

               HOWARD
     I know Maalox comes from magnesium
     oxide.  All the Jews in New York
     drink it.

Melvin looks at him.

               MELVIN
     Well that's more than most people
     know.

               HOWARD
     Thank you.

               MELVIN
     I wasn't complimenting you.  That 
     was just a comment.

               HOWARD 
     Still I appreciate it.

Silence.

               MELVIN 
     Don't bother me, dirty work or no. 
     Was a milkman once -- used to 
     stink of sour milk.  Now I smell 
     like Maalox.

               HOWARD 
     What a shame.

               MELVIN 
     I remember once -- I was delivering 
     milk in the middle of the night --
     and it come to me -- why don't I 
     get a job on graveyard like some 
     of them old gals' husbands -- so 
     I went around to McDonnell Douglas 
     and Hughes --

               HOWARD 
     And what happened?

               MELVIN 
     Nuthin.'

               HOWARD 
     What a shame.

               MELVIN
     You keep saying 'what a shame' ---

               HOWARD 
     I might have done something.

               MELVIN
     Done what?

               HOWARD 
     I'm Howard Hughes.

Melvin's head swivels, he squints over at Howard beside him. 
Now he looks back at the road.  Suddenly he turns back
to Howard.

               MELVIN
     How's that?

               HOWARD 
     I said I'm Howard Hughes.

Melvin stifles a smile, tries to look very serious, steals 
another look over at Howard, now he shakes his head to 
himself.

               MELVIN
     Well I believe in anybody callin' 
     themselves anything they want to.

               HOWARD
     I appreciate that.


31     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Windshield, a raindrop, then another.  Then a sudden 
downpour, a desert shower, stopping almost as soon as
it starts.


32     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The rain clearing, just a gray sky.  He opens the window. 
Howard opens his window.

               MELVIN 
          (breathing in)
     Greasewood.

               HOWARD 
          (breathing in)
     Sage.

               MELVIN
     Nothing like the smell of the
     desert after the rain.

               HOWARD 
     Greasewood and sage. 

They roll along for a while.


33     HOWARD AND MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - NIGHT

Way in the distance, the casinos and hotels rising out of the 
desert -- Las Vegas.


34     OMITTED


35     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - NIGHT

rolling into Las Vegas on the boulevard.  The blaze of neon 
lighting up his and Howard's face.

               MELVIN 
     Can I let you off at the Salvation
     Army?

               HOWARD 
     No thanks. What are you going to 
     do?

               MELVIN
     We'll keep pluggin'.


36     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN AND HOWARD

               HOWARD 
     Let me off at The Sands.

Melvin drives down Las Vegas Blvd., and pulls in at The Sands. 

               HOWARD 
     Over there.

Melvin drives around the back, towards the bungalows, slowly, 
about 10 MPH.

               HOWARD 
     Stop ---

               MELVIN
     Right here?

               HOWARD 
     This is the place.

Melvin stops, looks over at Howard. 

               MELVIN 
     You got a friend in the kitchen? 
     Give you some money to get that 
     ear attended to?

Howard doesn't answer, fiddling with the door handle.

               HOWARD 
     How do you get out of this thing?

Melvin reaches across Howard, flips the door handle, the door 
opens.

               MELVIN 
     Well I enjoyed it, ol' buddy.

He smiles at Howard, swings the door wide open, Howard hesi-
tates.

Suddenly ---

               HOWARD
     You got any money?

Melvin sighs, reaches in his pocket, fumbles. 


37     CLOSEUP - HOWARD 

waiting, watching. 


38     ON MELVIN

fishing in his pocket.

               MELVIN 
     Ain't got but a quarter change ---

Howard doesn't answer, holds out his hand, Melvin drops the 
quarter into it.

Howard gets out now, shuts the door.

               HOWARD
     Thank you, Melvin.

And he is gone.


39     EXT. GABBS, NEVADA - BEFORE SUNRISE

The middle of nowhere.  In the distance, dense, white chemical 
smoke curling up off the ridge where a magnesium plant hovers. 
Down below, almost a mile away, the town, rutted dirt streets
lined with trailers.


40     OMITTED


41      ON MELVIN

driving down a baked-clay side street, dirty dogs clearing 
out of the way.  A battered Airstream trailer lies ahead on
the right.  Pulling into the yard, grassless and sandy, a
plastic pool caked with mud.  A pull toy straddling an old 
clothes wringer.  A clothesline, a child's snowsuit pinned 
to it.


42     ON MELVIN

climbing out of the car, picking his way to the door of the 
trailer, past a new Honda leaning against the air drums.


43     INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAWN

A dinette set fighting for space with a child's bicycle and 
toys.  A new TV, a dishrag from the evening meal draped over
it.

Melvin moves to a partition, a blanket strung on a piece of 
twine.


43-A     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Darcy, a nymphet 10 years old, sound asleep.  He bends to kiss 
her, tucks the blanket around her.  She smiles.  Melvin adjusts 
the heater, then moves off, pulling the partition closed.


44     ON LYNDA

in her middle twenties, hunched sexy shoulders of an ex-cheer-
leader, busky and redolent with sleep now.  Melvin peels off 
his clothes, they drop at his ankles as he climbs into bed.

ON MELVIN AND LYNDA

He touches her.  And she stirs.  Melvin is glazed with the
heat of her sleep, the warmth of the bed, Lynda's proximity. 
He rustles, she tries to quiet him, but now he moves over
her.  Excited by her, and now she by him, their intimacy
always contained, conscious of Darcy beyond the curtain.


45     LATER

Melvin falling asleep. Lynda awake beside him.  The sound of 
a car pulling up.  Lynda freezes.  A car door opens, shuts.

Another car door opens, shuts.


ON LYNDA

She doesn't move, tuned into the sounds, familiar with them 
almost, dreading them.  Now she gets up and goes to the win-
dow, looks out.


46     EXT. MELVIN'S YARD - EARLY MORNING - LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW

A jump cable being connected to a battery in Melvin's car. 
A spark flies, the car starts.  Repossession men in their 
Montgomery Ward suits, flip the cable off, throw it in the
trunk of their car.  One starts to close the trunk, the 
other stops him.


ON MELVIN'S MOTORCYCLE

One lifts the handlebars, the other the rear wheel, and they 
heave it into their trunk.


47     INT. TRAILER - EARLY MORNING - ON LYNDA

She starts for the door, then stops.  She lifts the curtain of 
the other window.


48     EXT. MELVIN'S YARD - EARLY MORNING - LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW

Melvin's car driving down the dusty street.  Following it the
repo car, the trunk lid catching the dawn light as it bobbles 
over the motorcycle.


49     CLOSEUP - LYNDA

turning back to Melvin.  He sleeps soundly, oblivious, beati-
fic.

Lynda reaches for the telephone.


50     ROAD TO GABBS - DAWN - A PICKUP
                                    
jaunting down the road.  At the wheel in a straw cowman's hat, 
Clark Taylor.  Stashed in a rack behind him, like a shotgun, 
his guitar.


51     INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAY - LYNDA
                                                             
pressing a doll of Darcy's into a little wicker suitcase. 
Darcy dressed and scruffy, wiping the sleep from her eyes. 
They hear Clark's truck pull up  Lynda goes to the door, 
makes a motion for Clark to wait.

          
51-A     EXT. MEL'S YARD - DAY - CLARK

reaching for his guitar, opening the case, starts to noodle 
as he waits.


52     ON LYNDA 

frantically finishes throwing clothes into a bag as Melvin
begins to stir.  She half-pulls, half-pushes Darcy out the
door.  Darcy heads for the pickup.

Lynda reaches for her own bag, and she sees Melvin turn over. 
She rushes out the door, then stops.  Goes back.


53     ON LYNDA AND MELVIN 
For an instant, the feeling she might want to climb into bed
with him.  She reaches down, jostles him awake.  Melvin
looks up.

               LYNDA
     Good-bye, Melvin.

She leaves.


54     ON MELVIN 

He blinks, sits up.

               MELVIN
     Hunh?


54-A     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The partition pulled, Darcy's bed empty. 


55     ON MELVIN 

He throws himself out of bed, dives out the door. 


56     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE PICKUP TRUCK

already disappearing up the road, Darcy's face pressed to the
rear window.  She waves.

The old dog sitting where Melvin's car was.  Melvin spins
for his motorcycle.  Nothing there but an oil rag in the dust.


57     CLOSEUP - MELVIN

blinking, bewildered.  He looks down the road, the smoke
ever curling up from the magnesium plant.


58      EXT. RENO, NEVADA - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT


59     EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - RENO - DAY

Clark Taylor exits a motel room and heads for his truck. In-
side, Lynda lies in the shards of a glass coffee table as 
Darcy creeps out of the bathroom where she has been hiding.

Lynda and Darcy stare at the doorway for a long time.

               LYNDA 
     Musicians stink.

Darcy moves to Lynda now, sinks in her mother's arms, now she 
turns and helps her mother up on the couch.  She examines 
Lynda's face, touching a bruised cheek; licks the blood from 
a scratch on her forehead.

They just lie there.

               DARCY 
     It's my fault.

               LYNDA
     What are you talking about?

               DARCY
     He didn't want a kid around.

               LYNDA
     He said he wanted a kid. He said
     he wanted you. Been after me for
     months.  I would divorce Melvin
     and he would adopt you.

               DARCY
     Didn't Johnny Pike say that?

After a moment.

               LYNDA
     Yeah. 

               DARCY
     What did Johnny Pike play?

               LYNDA
     Bass.

Lynda gets up wearily from the couch, picks up the pieces of
glass.  Darcy helps her.

               DARCY
     How're we gonna pay for this?

               LYNDA
     With a job.

               DARCY
     What job?

               LYNDA
     I don't know -- a job. 

               DARCY
     At the donut shop?

               LYNDA
     Maybe not a donut shop again.
          (smiles) 
     Maybe a donut shop.

               DARCY
     It doesn't matter, Ma.

Lynda sighs.

               LYNDA
     Or cocktail waitress ---

               DARCY 
     I'll have to help you.

               LYNDA
     What are you talking about?

               DARCY
     Don't you remember?  Last time you 
     flunked.  You thought a Moscow Mule 
     was a King Alfonse and a King 
     Alfonse was a Moscow Mule?  And 
     then you had the fight with the
     bartender?

A heel is broken in Lynda's shoe. She throws it against the
wall.

               LYNDA
     I remember.

               DARCY
     I think I want to go home.

Silence.

               LYNDA
     I can't go home, honey.

               DARCY 
     I know it's hard without a car for
     you.  But you know I only have to
     walk to school.

Lynda looks at her.

               LYNDA
     You miss school.

               DARCY  
     I miss my friends.

               LYNDA
     And Daddy?

After a moment.

               DARCY
     I don't miss him.
          (after another
          moment) 
     Yeah, I miss him.

               LYNDA
     Me, too ---

               DARCY
          (jumping up)
     Good!

               LYNDA
          (jumping up) 
     But, I wouldn't go back to that
     sonofabitch if he were the last man
     on earth!

               DARCY
     Don't swear, Mama.

               LYNDA
     I'm sorry. 

She touches Darcy.

               LYNDA
     C'm'on, I'll walk you to the bus.

Lynda makes her way across the room, picks up the broken shoe, 
strips the padding off the sole, takes out a ten-dollar bill.


60     INT. BUS TERMINAL - RENO - DAY

Lynda coming away from the ticket window, counting her change,
a couple of dollars.  She presses the ticket into Darcy's hand. 
Now she moves to the lunch counter.


61     LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW - A LUNCH COUNTER CUSTOMER

Sitting at the counter, chewing on a ham sandwich.  Lynda 
looks at the sandwich warily.

               LYNDA
     You're not eating here.  Take a 
     seat, honey, I'll be right back.


62     ANOTHER ANGLE - LUNCH COUNTER

Lynda undoing a grocery bag.  Pulls out a loaf of Italian 
bread.

               LYNDA
          (to the 
          Counterman)
     Hey, you got a knife?

He turns around from the sandwich board, Lynda smiles.  He 
hands her the knife.  She cuts the loaf in half.

Reaches for a jar of mustard resting on the counter.  Smears 
the bread.

Now she removes a packet of ham from the grocery bag, lays 
the whole, thick stack on one of the slabs of bread.  She 
steals a leaf of lettuce from a plate that hasn't been 
cleared, presses it on the ham, covers the concoction with 
a second slab of bread.  Wraps the sandwich up in the waxed 
bread paper.

               COUNTERMAN 
     Now how about something to drink?

Lynda opens her palm to the nickel and dime that remain.

               LYNDA 
     Give us a Milky Way.

The Counterman flips her a Milky Way, she opens it, breaks it
in half, hands half to Darcy.  They walk out, munching on
their halves of candy bar.


63     EXT. BUS BAYS - RENO BUS STATION - DAY

Lynda kisses Darcy at the door.  Darcy climbs up, moves to a
seat on the bus, Lynda following her from the platform.  Darcy 
takes a seat, opens her brown bag.


64     ON DARCY 

waving to Lynda, reaching into the bag, lifting out the sand-
wich, takes a huge bite. 

She flashes the "okay" sign.


65     ON LYNDA 

The bus is thrown into gear, Lynda waves hysterically as the 
bus backs out.

And then all of a sudden it disappears.


66     EXT. RENO STREET - GO-GO SALOON - DAY - LYNDA

walking down a Reno street.  The sound of music coming from a 
doorway.  She looks through the window.


67     OMITTED 


68     EXT. GABBS - BUS STOP - DAY

The bus arrives.  Darcy gets off -- runs to Melvin.  They hug.


69      BAGGING ROOM - BASIC MANUFACTURING - GABBS, NEVADA

Melvin is seated astride a crate in front of a bagging machine. 
He holds open the bag, the magnesium oxide powder pours out,
the machine seals the bag.  Melvin heaves it on a treadmill
behind.

At the base of the treadmill is Little Red, sacking the bags 
on a pallet as they come off.  A forklift reaches in, plucks 
the pallet, and shovels it onto a trailer outside.

The whistle blows.  Melvin hits a button -- the machine stops.

Melvin reaches for his lunch pail.  Opens it.  The remains of 
a sandwich, encrusted with staleness.  He snaps it shut, 
follows Little Red out onto the loading platform.  They jump 
down, move into the weigh-shack.


70     INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

A gauge for a scale, a radiator, a five-gallon coffee urn.

It is cold out and when they enter the shack, their breath 
vaporizes.  They sit on the edge of the radiator.

               MELVIN
     Your coffee's on.

               LITTLE RED
     I always leave it on.

               MELVIN 
     How long's it been on?

               LITTLE RED
     What's the date today?

               MELVIN 
     Twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth ---

               LITTLE RED 
     Twenty-four, twenty-five days.  I
     start it on the first of the month.

Little Red looks at Melvin.

               LITTLE RED 
     You can't go on like this, Mel.

               MELVIN 
     Like what?

               LITTLE RED
     Moonin' like a baby.  Lynda'll
     come back.  They always do -- take
     me, I can't stand my wife.

               MELVIN 
     You told me.

               LITTLE RED
     But I always go back.  I'm going
     back this weekend.  You wanna
     come?

               MELVIN 
     See your wife?

               LITTLE RED
     I got a sister.

               MELVIN 
     You got a sister?

Little Red reaches for a coffee cup.

               MELVIN 
     She short like you with red hair?

               LITTLE RED
     Tall with blue.  Takes tolls on
     the Golden Gate Bridge.  You'll
     like her.

Little Red places the cup under the coffee spout.  It doesn't 
flow.  He tips the urn, now releases the spigot, the coffee 
spurts out.

Follow the coffee from the spout to the floor.  On the floor, 
a hole has been worn, like a crater, from the drippings of 
the coffee.

               LITTLE RED
     What do you say, Melvin?

Melvin sighs, looking at the hole in the floor.

               MELVIN 
     I don't want to go to San Francisco, 
     Red.  But I'll hitch a ride with 
     you to Reno.


71      EXT. GABBS HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Melvin driving, Little Red beside him.  Little Red is drunk. 
He reaches for his bottle, takes a pull, tries to hand it to 
Melvin.

               LITTLE RED
     Here you go, Mel.

               MELVIN
     Put that stuff away.

               LITTLE RED
     You sure are good, Mel.


72     ON LITTLE RED

half-asleep, occasionally lighting a cigarette, smoking it 
dreamily.


73      ANOTHER ANGLE 

Little Red sleeping in the front seat.  Suddenly he leaps up, 
Melvin almost swerves off the road.

               LITTLE RED
     What happened?

               MELVIN 
     You dropped your cigarette!

Smoke pours up from under Little Red.  He jumps out of the
car.

               MELVIN 
     You little red asshole!

Melvin whips off his jacket, starts beating away at the 
smoking seat.  Little Red is running around outside of the
car, cooling himself.  Finally, Melvin who is making no
headway, rips the whole seat out from its slides, throws
it in the road.

               MELVIN 
     Now you drive.  And stay awake!

Little Red dutifully climbs into the driver's seat.  Melvin
lays down in the rear, goes to sleep.


74      EXT. MUSTANG RANCH - NIGHT 

The car is stopped.  Melvin coughs, wakes up.


75     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

Little Red is gone.  It is night.

Nothing around but desert.  Melvin peers in another direction. 
A barbed-wire fence, a group of trailers, elevated guard 
tower, spotlights.

               MELVIN 
     Oh, no.


76     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

climbing out of the car, walking slowly to a high gate made
of hurricane fencing.  He tries the knob, nothing happens. 
Jiggles it.

A Voice booms out over the desert.

               VOICE 
     Yes?

               MELVIN 
     You got a little red-haired guy in 
     there?

               VOICE
     Name?

               MELVIN
     Little Red.

               VOICE
     Just a minute.

Melvin cups his hands, blows air through them, stomps his 
feet in the cold.

               VOICE 
     He's here.

Melvin jiggles the gate again.

               VOICE
     What do you want?

               MELVIN
     Him.

               VOICE
     Are you a customer?

               MELVIN
     No, sir, I'm not.

               VOICE
     'Ma'am'---

               MELVIN
     No, ma'am, I'm not.

               VOICE
     We can't let you in unless you're 
     a customer.

               MELVIN 
     I don't want to get laid, ma'am. 
     I just want my buddy.

               VOICE
     Hold on.

The wind whistles, a coyote calls.  Melvin stomps his feet.

               VOICE
     Sorry ---

Melvin looks around the desert, shrugs.  He walks back to 
the car, climbs into the driver's seat, reaches for the 
ignition. 

No key.


77      ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

climbing slowly out of the car, jiggling the gate again.

               VOICE
     What do you want?

               MELVIN 
     I'd like to get laid.

The gate buzzes, Melvin moves through, walks up to the 
trailer.  He presses a buzzer, a face appears at the window, 
lets him in.


78      INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

               MADAM
     Welcome to the Cottontail Ranch.

               MELVIN
     Thank you, ma'am.

There are a couple of security men lolling in the lounge.

               MADAM
     Your friend's with Tina in 4, right 
     down the hall.

Melvin starts down the hall.

               MADAM
     Just a minute --

Melvin keeps walking, the security man blocks his path.

               MADAM
     It'll cost you twenty-two fifty.

               MELVIN
     You're kidding.

The security man moves a step closer.

               MELVIN
     I got a problem ---

               MADAM 
     What's your problem?

               MELVIN 
     I don't have twenty-two fifty.

               MADAM
     What have you got?

               MELVIN 
     I got shit.  My wife's left me, my 
     little girl's home with my brother's 
     family, I almost got burned up in 
     a car, and now my best buddy's 
     crapped out in a cathouse in the 
     middle of the desert!

After a moment.

               MADAM
     I see.

               MELVIN
     Let me get my buddy.

               MADAM
     You can't go back there for less 
     than twenty-two fifty.

               MELVIN 
     All I want's the key to the car. 
     You can have him.

               MADAM
     I don't know what to tell you, son. 
     We don't make the rules.  The
     county does.  Twenty dollars for the
     trick.  A dollar for a towel.  A
     dollar-fifty deposit on the towel.

Melvin looks at his watch.

               MELVIN 
     Lynda give this to me for my thirtieth 
     birthday ---

She takes the watch from him.

               MELVIN 
     You get the phases of the moon ---

               MADAM
     Our girls know the phases of the 
     moon.

She hands the watch back.  Melvin shifts, parts a curtain on 
the window.

               MELVIN 
     Tell you what.  He's got a brand new 
     spare tire on the Monaco -- four-ply
     radial -- non-skid -- whitewall ---

               MADAM
     What am I going to do with a tire?

               MELVIN
          (points at the
          security man)
     I don't know, maybe you can hang it 
     on his dick!

The security man smiles.

               MELVIN 
          (to the Madam)
     Help me, lady.

She drums her fingers.

               MADAM
     Go get your friend.


79     INT. TRAILER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The security man buzzes Melvin through a door, and Melvin 
moves down the curtain corridor, opens the door to number 4.

                                                                       
79-A     INT. TRAILER ROOM #4 - NIGHT

A pretty girl, Tina, is practicing tap dancing on a practice
board in a corner of the room.  Little Red is resting on the
edge of the bed, his head slumped on his chest.  All his 
clothes are off except one shoe and a sock.  He holds the 
shoe in one hand.  He is fast asleep.

               TINA
     That's as far as he got.  Our license 
     requires we give him thirty minutes 
     -- he's got seven to go.

Melvin looks down at Little Red.

               MELVIN
     Give me a hand here.

Tina gets up, Melvin lays Little Red on his back, together 
they start to dress him.

               MELVIN
     You married, Tina?

               TINA
     I got a kid in Carson City, my hus-
     band's in Reno.  My mother's in Vegas
     and you just passed my father out in 
     the hallway.

               MELVIN
     Lord.

Tina is struggling with Little Red's pants.

               TINA
     You do his fly.  I don't want to
     catch him in it.

Melvin sighs.

               MELVIN
     You sure got a sense of humor.  My
     name's Melvin Dummar.  Let me shake 
     your hand, Tina.

Tina shakes Melvin's hand.  Their eyes meet.

               TINA
     You married, Melvin?

Melvin beams, looks down at Red, dressed all lopsidedly, 
still sound asleep.

               MELVIN 
     Where could we put this if we wanted 
     to share a few minutes together?

               TINA
     In the hallway.  No one will know
     the difference.

They heave Little Red onto a chair outside the crib.  Prop 
him up, and close the curtain on him.

               MELVIN
     There's only one problem.

               TINA
     What's that?

               MELVIN 
     I haven't got twenty-two fifty.

               TINA
     That's all right, he's still got 
     seven minutes.  And besides, my watch 
     just stopped.


79-B     RENO - NIGHT - MELVIN AND LITTLE RED

speeding along, approaching Reno, the neon beckoning.


80     EXT. MOTEL - RENO - NIGHT

Melvin exits Little Red's car and enters the motel office. 
Little Red drives off.


81     LYNDA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin enters, looks into the unmade bed, checks the sheets. 
Now moves into the bathroom.  Spies some false eyelashes on
the shelf.  Examines them between his fingers.

Now he sits down on the commode.  As he does, he sees the 
fringe and tassels of a go-go costume, lovingly laid out to
dry on a towel.  He picks it up, holds it away from himself. 
Now he brings it close, smells it, buries his nose in the 
tiny swatch of material.


82     INT. GO-GO SALOON - RENO - NIGHT - MELVIN

muscling his way through the crowded casino, up to the 
scattered characters at the bar.


83     LYNDA

dancing go-go, kind of enjoying it.


84      GO-GO DANCER 

next to Lynda; her name is Lucy and her arm is in a cast. 
She pokes Lynda's elbow, tries to yell over the noise.

               LUCY
     A guy's waving at you over there.

Lynda looks down.

               LYNDA
     Oh my God, it's Melvin.

She dances off in the other direction, but Melvin runs around 
the bar following her.  She dances back the other way now, but 
Melvin has leaped up on the stage and pulled the plug on the 
speaker.  He carries a suitcase.

Silence in the bar.  Two security men head towards Melvin.

               MELVIN
     You come home with me, Lynda.  Get
     out of this place and come home 
     with your husband, Melvin Dummar.

A Voice from the crowd.

               VOICE 
     You go home, Melvin.

               ANOTHER VOICE
     Yeah, go on home, Melvin.

Lynda looks on helplessly.

               MELVIN 
     Lynda, you're my wife!  Now come
     home!

The security men leap on the bar.

               MELVIN 
     Git outa these bars, Lynda, and 
     come back where you belong.

               LYNDA
     I won't! 

               MELVIN 
     You gotta! 

               LYNDA
     I can't! 

               MELVIN 
     Why not?!

               LYNDA
     I love to dance!

               LUCY
          (hugging Lynda) 
     Oh, Lynda!  You make me feel so
     good.

Melvin throws off the security men, and rips open the suitcase.

               MELVIN 
     All right, you like these damn
     bars?!  Then you can live in these
     damn bars!

               LYNDA
     How's Darcy?

               MELVIN 
     She's fine!

Melvin strews Lynda's clothes on the bar, shirts, pants,
underwear.

               LYNDA
          Oh Jeezus, Melvin.

Now as the security men charge Melvin a last time, he leaps 
off the bar, at the same time throws a torrent of fringe and
tassels at Lynda.

Lynda catches them in the face, they stop her. She reaches 
down and picks a few up.

               LYNDA
     He cut up my best Day-Glo.

The owner plugs in the music, instantly the girls resume 
dancing.  Melvin threads his way out to catcalls and a
single "Attaboy, Melvin!"

The owner beckons Lynda.

               JERRY 
     How often does this happen, Lynda?

               LYNDA
     I'm sorry, Jerry.

               JERRY
     I feel for you and everything, but 
     you know it's not the best thing 
     for business --

               LYNDA 
     I know, I know.
          (sighs) 
     I was quittin' anyway. 

She heads for her dressing room.


84-1A     EXT. GO-GO CLUB - NIGHT - MELVIN

stomps off into the night.

him this time.


85     INT. CLUB 29 - RENO - LATE AFTERNOON

Another saloon -- Lynda in another go-go costume, serving
drinks now.  The Owner leans over her shoulder.

               OWNER
     Someone here to see you.

Lynda looks up.  It is Melvin.

               LYNDA 
     Oh God.

She walks right up to him.

               LYNDA
     What do you want, Melvin?

               MELVIN 
     No fights, no bickering -- just 
     carrying out the law, plain and 
     simple.
          (hands her
          a paper)
     Interlocutory decree.  She's final 
     in six weeks.
          (hands her
          a ring) 
     And my wedding ring -- keep yours 
     if you like.

               LYNDA
     Aw, Melvin.

               MELVIN 
     I'll be seein' you, Lynda.

He stalks off.  She unfolds the document.

               LYNDA
     Hey, wait a minute!  What's it say
     about Darcy in here?

               MELVIN 
     I get custody.

               LYNDA
     What do you mean, you get custody?

               MELVIN 
     No daughter of mine's going to 
     hang around these bars.

Lynda throws the tray of drinks she is carrying in his face.

Melvin comes up spitting, reaches over the bar for a customer's
glass of beer and throws it at Lynda -- The Owner jumps on the 
bar, grabs Melvin by the neck.

               OWNER
     Now, wait a minute!

               MELVIN 
          (loosing himself) 
     I was goin' anyway.

Melvin turns on his heel and walks out.

               OWNER
          (exasperated) 
     Hey, look, Lynda --

               LYNDA
     Never mind.  I quit.

She draws the string on her go-go costume, it drops to the 
floor in front of the astounded Owner and patrons.  And now, 
with the utmost dignity, Lynda, all naked, strides to the 
dressing room past the gawks of the bewildered customers.


85-A     EXT. CLUB 29 - MAGIC HOUR 

Melvin leaps into Red's car beside Darcy, roars off with
tires smoking.  A fender falls off into the street.  Melvin
keeps going.


86     EXT. RENO STREET - LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A house on a side street, the Reno neon glitter burning bright 
in the b.g.  Lynda walks to the door.

                                              
86-A     INT. LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lucy picks up Lynda's bag, leads her to a bedroom.


86-B     INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lucy turns on the light. The room is a mess, but cozy. 

               LYNDA
     Gee -- and I almost had to spend 
     the night with some sonofabitch 
     lawyer.

               LUCY
     Are there any other kind?

               LYNDA
     I just want to get my little girl 
     back.  My husband's divorcing me.

               LUCY
     Why?

               LYNDA
     Because he can't make any money and
     it makes him feel bad.

Lynda pitches her bag on the bed, starts undressing.  Lucy
hangs up her clothes.

               LYNDA
     So I can stay here as long as I
     want?

               LUCY
     Long as you want.  Until your baby
     comes.  Don't ask me how, I always 
     know.

               LYNDA
     And did you know I'll never see the
     father again?

               LUCY
     Don't worry, kid.  You'll get an 
     abortion, it'll all be over ---

               LYNDA
          (interrupting) 
     Oh, no, I had one of those. I kept
     dreaming of bunnies drowning.

Lynda climbs under the covers.

               LUCY
     I'll bet I know what that means ---

               LYNDA
     Don't tell me.  I'm just not going
     to do it again.

               LUCY
     Melvin knocked you up.  That
     bastard.

               LYNDA
     Maybe Melvin.  Maybe not Melvin. 
     Melvin's okay.

               LUCY
     You mean we like Melvin?  A few 
     kind men left in this world, right? 
     But we're leaving him, right?

               LYNDA
     Melvin's left me.

               LUCY
     What are you going to do now?

               LYNDA
     Same thing I always do.  Go home 
     to Mother.

A sea of tract houses.  Zoom in on one, any one.  The Sisk's

and two boys tossing a football.


89     INT. LYNDA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

Lynda sits on a couch in a pair of pregnant hot pants and a 
bra watching television.

Lynda is eight months pregnant.  Her mother, Mrs. Sisk, sits
beside her.  The dog, "Tramp" wanders in.

               MRS. SISK 
     You want something cold to drink,

               LYNDA 
     No thanks, Ma.

     Anything happens, call a cab to

Now she looks at the phone.


92     INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAY 

Melvin is fixing breakfast.  Chaos.  Toasters, griddle cakes,
pop up tarts.  Bubbling coffee pot.  Whirring milkshake
blender.  Vegamatic.  Darcy is watching "Easy Street" on
television.  Melvin has his eye on it.


93     ON THE TV

               WALLY

A lady dressed like a phonograph record can't decide which
gate to choose.

     Gate number 2.

               MELVIN

The lady chooses door number one -- she wins.  Melvin's face
lights up.

               WALLY 
     And you've entered it, madam, the
     Golden Gate!  Inside....

The gate swings open.

     kissed her ---

The telephone rings.

Darcy turns the television set off, tumbles outside and
climbs on her bike.  Past the windows of the trailer, riding
lazily in the dusty twilight, past dogs, past a kid on a
wagon, past a basket of laundry.

Melvin picks up the phone.   Darcy keeps riding around the
trailer.

               MELVIN
     Hullo?

               LYNDA
          Hello, Melvin?

                    MELVIN
     Hey, Lynda.  How's it going? 

               LYNDA
     How's what going?

               MELVIN 
     I dunno, whatever you got going.

               LYNDA
     Could Darcy come down and see me?

               MELVIN 
     You pregnant?

               LYNDA
     What do you mean, am I pregnant?! 
     What do you say a thing like that
     for?!!

               MELVIN
     I dunno.  You sound pregnant.  For
     what other reason would you ask me 
     to let Darcy go down there and hang 
     around them bars?

               LYNDA
     I don't go to bars, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     And that air in L.A.  All that 
     smog.  All them people.  How preg-
     nant are you?  For your sake, you 
     better hope it's a girl.

               LYNDA 
     What are you talking about, Melvin?

               MELVIN 
     Because if it's a boy and it looks 
     like Clark Halsted, I'm going to
     kill it.

               LYNDA
     I just want to see Darcy.

               MELVIN 
     And then I'm going to kill you. 
          (after a moment) 
     I'd rather have you come up.

               LYNDA
     Where?

               MELVIN 
     Las Vegas.  We'll do it in Las Vegas. 
     I'll marry you there.

               LYNDA
     You just divorced me, Melvin.  What
     do you want to marry me for?

               MELVIN
     I don't want my little girl having
     illegitimate kin.

               LYNDA
     Melvin?

               MELVIN
     Yes, honey?

               LYNDA
     I've been reading this book 'The 
     Magic of Believing.'

               MELVIN
     Yeah, what's that?

               LYNDA
     It's about you.

               MELVIN
          (smiling) 
     Hey.

               LYNDA
     It says you can be anything you 
     want to be if you'll just believe 
     in yourself.  And you believe in
     yourself -- it's just the believing
     hasn't been enough to let you become 
     what you believe you can be.

               MELVIN 
     Rome wasn't built in a day.  We'll 
     keep plugging.

               LYNDA
     I've been thinking, Melvin.  I 
     haven't been good to you.  I
     haven't believed in you like you
     believe in you.

               MELVIN 
     How's insurance sound to you?

               LYNDA 
     Insurance.  Real estate.  Anything
     but bagging at Basic.

               MELVIN 
     Yeah, the ol' paycheck-to-paycheck. 
     Frustratin', when I know I was born
     for something else.

               LYNDA
     You really want to marry me, Melvin?

Mrs. Sisk enters (she's been eavesdropping) and frantically,
silently, signals "No!  Not again!"

               MELVIN
     I heard you was livin' with whores
     over in Reno.

               LYNDA
     I knew you didn't.

               MELVIN 
     But I want you to know I'm not going 
     to hold it against you, however ---

               LYNDA
     Melvin, don't start gettin' around 
     me now ---

               MELVIN 
     Aw, honey, I want to get around you. 
     I been missin' you.  Miss your lovin' ---

He starts to sing over the telephone.

               MELVIN 
          (singing) 
     'My woman, my woman, my wife --'


95     EXT. GAS STATION - LAS VEGAS - DAY - MELVIN AND LITTLE RED 

are waiting in Little Red's car, which has been specially 
spruced and decorated for the occasion; as has Little Red. 
A replacement fender is in evidence.


96     INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY - LYNDA

waits as Darcy struggles with the ties on an 8-month pregnant 
sateen suit, bought for the wedding. 

Now she presents herself to Darcy.

               LYNDA 
     How do I look?

               DARCY
          (worshipful)
     Fat.  But nice.


97     EXT. GAS STATION - DAY - LITTLE RED

drives to the door of the restroom.  Melvin leaps out and 
swings the door open.  Darcy helps Lynda in.


98     EXT. SILVER BELL WEDDING CHAPEL - LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DAY

Melvin helps Lynda out.  He is dressed in boots, spurs,
double-knit pants and his best cowboy roses shirt.

Before they go inside, he gives his hair a lick with his 
comb.  Then he takes Darcy and gives her hair a lick with 
his comb, wipes the comb off and puts it back in his pocket.


99     INT. SILVER BELL WEDDING CHAPEL - DAY

A tiny room with ice-cream chairs and a white pulpit under 
an arbor of wax flowers.

The Owner, a kindly, fat woman is at her desk at front.

               MELVIN
     We're the Dummars.

               OWNER 
     Not yet, you're 'The Dummars.'

               MELVIN
     Oh yeah, we're the Dummars and we're 
     getting married again.

               OWNER 
     Wonderful!  Were you with us the 
     first time?   We've had a lot of 
     repeaters -- repeaters are our 
     favorite folks.

               MELVIN
     No, ma'am.

               OWNER 
          (to Lynda) 
     Would you like a veil?

Lynda looks over at Melvin.

               MELVIN
     How much is a veil?

               OWNER 
     Four dollars.

Lynda motioning "don't."

               MELVIN
     We'll take a veil.

Owner hands Lynda a pink veil.

               LYNDA
     Ya got a blue one?  To go with
     my suit?

               OWNER 
     I've got white.   The second time 
     around the girls like a color.

               MELVIN
     We'll take white.

               OWNER 
     Now, on the music ---

               MELVIN
     What have you got?

               OWNER 
     We have Inspirational, 'Because,' 
     we have Hawaiian, the 'War Chant,' 
     we have ---

     LYNDA                        MELVIN
'Because.'                 'Hawaiian War Chant.'

They look at each other.

               LYNDA
     'Hawaiian War Chant.'

               OWNER 
     Very good.  That's five dollars on 
     the veil, five dollars on the music, 
     fifteen dollars for the ceremony, 
     four dollars for the license, ten 
     dollars for the witnesses -- thirty-
     nine dollars all together.

Melvin reaches in his pocket, pulls out all his money.

               OWNER 
     Thirty-nine out of forty.  Thank
     you.

She hands Melvin a dollar back.

               MELVIN
     That don't leave us much for break-
     fast.  I wasn't counting on the
     witnesses.

The Owner indicates a terribly decrepit old couple, waiting 
in an ante-room in two chairs, wearing their Sunday best.

               OWNER 
     Well, they've got to make a living,
     too.

Darcy tugs on the Owner's arm who is pressing button behind 
her desk.

               DARCY
     A bag of rice, please.

               OWNER 
     Well aren't you sweet, honey?

She hands Darcy a bag of rice and collects fifty cents.

The Hawaiian War Chant starts.  The lights lower.  A Justice
of the Peace materializes behind the pulpit.  And Lynda and
Melvin, with Darcy behind then, move stately down the aisle.


100     PULPIT - JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

               JP 
     'Til death do us part.'

               MELVIN 
     'Til death do us part.'

               JP 
     Lynda and Melvin, I now pronounce 
     you man and wife.

Melvin and Lynda kiss.

               LYNDA
     This is it, Melvin.

He hugs her tight.

               MELVIN 
     Ooh, you got a fat belly, woman.

The witnesses come forward.  The old Lady kisses Melvin and
the old man busses Lynda -- a long long time.  They all start
up back the aisle -- Darcy is throwing rice.

The old man falters.  The wedding party stops.

               OLD LADY 
     What's the matter, George? 
          (to Lynda and Melvin) 
     He gets weak in the heat -- I better 
     take him home.

They turn to go, the Owner pays them off at the desk and they 
leave.

               OWNER 
     Now what am I going to do?  I got 
     three couples coming in at eleven ---


101      MONTAGE - MELVIN, LYNDA AND DARCY

Outside, Melvin and Lynda saying good-bye to Little Red; 
inside, witnessing a dozen marriages.  Kissing their opposites. 
Darcy scattering bags of rice.  Melvin enjoying immensely.


102     EXT. SILVER BELL CHAPEL - THAT NIGHT

Melvin is drying himself with a towel, Lynda has loosened her 
suit and her stomach hangs over pants, Darcy asleep in the 
car.

               OWNER 
          (paying Melvin) 
     That's 12 couples at ten dollars
     each -- 120 dollars --
          (looks up)
     And may I say you were wonderful! 
     You're so in love -- it's good for 
     business.  Come back as witnesses 
     anytime.
          (reaches into 
          her drawer)
     And here's some party packets --
     five dollars free at Caesar's Palace 
     -- five dollars free at the Sands --
     five dollars free at the Desert Inn
     -- Love ya both!


103     VEGAS MONTAGE - NIGHT - LYNDA, MELVIN AND DARCY

eating, drinking, dancing, playing the slots.  Darcy hitting 
nickel jackpots, Melvin buying chances on classic cars, Lynda 
spraying complimentary perfume.


104     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DUMMARS 

at the Desert Inn.  Melvin, Lynda and Darcy playing auto-poker. 
They hit a flush. Cheers.


105     EXT. DAIRY - DAWN
thru
111     Dairy work montage.  Bonnie and Jim Delgado are out on the 
loading dock with Melvin, George, Pete and Ralph.  Other 
drivers are pulling in, loading and driving out.


112     INT. ROCKWOOD DIARY - BELLFLOWER - THE DRIVER'S ROOM

Melvin walking to the Cashier's window, pushes a stack of 
bills through the cage.

               MELVIN
     That's 225, Bonnie.

She counts it.

               BONNIE 
     225 is right.

               MELVIN 
     I tell you I'm going to win that 
     color TV.  I'm going to be Milkman 
     of the Month.

               BONNIE 
     Well, you're in the lead, Melvin. 
          (smiles) 
     And you want to know something?
     I'm rooting for you.

She blushes.

               MELVIN 
     You married, Bonnie?

But Bonnie doesn't answer, folds up the money, starts to turn 
back to her desk.

               BONNIE 
     Hey -- almost forgot -- Bill wants
     to see you.


112-A     INT. BILL'S OFFICE - DAIRY - DAY - MELVIN

Walks down the hall, enters an inner office.  A sign
"JIM DELGADO, Assistant Manager."

               JIM 
     Listen, Melvin, I just want to tell
     you, you been doin' real good!

               MELVIN 
     Why, thank you.

               JIM 
     Only thing is -- you know that 
     engine that blowed up your first 
     week -- I talked to Mr. Rockwood 
     -- there's just no way we can see 
     to doing anything but deducting it ---

               MELVIN 
     Now, wait a minute ---

               JIM 
     We'll take it real slow, just a 
     few dollars a week ---

               MELVIN 
     That wasn't my fault -- you give 
     me that old junker -- the motor 
     was shot.

               JIM 
     You signed the note, Melvin ---

               MELVIN 
     Didn't you know I was in the lead 
     for the Zenith 197K with the tri-
     focus picture tube?

               JIM 
     What can I tell you, Melvin?  We 
     figure Driver of the Month on net 
     -- and with your deductions coming 
     up ---

He shrugs.  Suddenly, Melvin reaches across and grabs him by
the shirt.

               MELVIN 
     Listen, you sonofabitch, that color 
     TV is mine!  That's for me!  My 
     wife and my little girl!  Deduct 
     whatever the hell you want, but 
     you know it and I know it -- I am 
     the goddamn Driver of the Month!

Bill is choking.

               JIM 
     Let go, Melvin.

Melvin doesn't let go.

               JIM 
     Let go, or don't come back tomorrow.

Melvin releases him.

               MELVIN
     What do you say?

               JIM 
     You're a good driver, Melvin ---

               MELVIN
     Driver of the Month!  Twenty new
     damn accounts!

               JIM 
     I'm sorry about the engine, Melvin 
     but it's your responsibility ---

               MELVIN
     Am I or am I not?!

Jim waits.

               JIM 
     You'll pay for the engines?

               MELVIN 
     I asked you, you bastard, am I
     Driver of the Month?!

               JIM 
     You are.

               MELVIN 
     And do I get the color TV?

After a moment.

               JIM 
     Okay.

Melvin nods.

               MELVIN 
     Deduct your goddam engine.


A-113     EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Melvin walks up the ramp to the main entrance.


113     INT. HOSPITAL - ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA - BABY NURSERY
CORRIDOR - DAY

Melvin passes among a few visitors, patients and medical staff. 
He stops at the nursery where a baby is raised to the window.
Nurses attend to several other infants.


114     CLOSEUP - MELVIN

registers nothing.


115     INT. LYNDA'S ROOM - DAY - LYNDA

Waiting, looking up at the ceiling.  Melvin enters.  There is 
a long silence.  Two other women lie quietly in their beds.

               LYNDA
     I'm sorry, Melvin.

               MELVIN 
     He's got them beady eyes and that 
     slack tongue.  Looks just like 
     Clark Taylor.

               LYNDA
     He could be yours, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     Mine!

               LYNDA
     You remember the morning the car
     was repossessed?

               MELVIN 
     You mean the morning you woke me 
     up to say good-bye?

Silence.

               LYNDA
     I am sorry, Melvin.  I prayed.  I
     prayed for a little girl.

Lynda doesn't move.

               MELVIN 
     Jee-zus!

He strides into the bathroom.  The sound of him urinating. 

Two nurses appear.  One has a stack of photographs.

               NURSE BURNS
     Hello, everybody!  What we have here
     is a few pictures taken at delivery 
     -- Miss Crockett and I work together 
     -- she photographs -- I process.

               MELVIN 
          (returning) 
     I'll bet you do.  You married,
     Miss Crockett?

               NURSE BURNS
     I'm Miss Burns.  My partner's
     Miss Crockett.

               MELVIN 
     How do you do, Miss Crockett.

               LYNDA
     No thank you, Miss Burns.

               MELVIN
     How much?

               NURSE CROCKETT
     A hundred and twenty dollars for 
     five beautiful color prints.

               LYNDA
     A hundred and twenty dollars!  You 
     got some racket!  Git outa here!

               MELVIN 
     Wait a minute -- let me see 'em.

Miss Burns shows him the pictures.   Melvin giggles -- then he
giggles some more.  Miss Crockett exits the room.

               MELVIN 
     Belly button looks like a corkscrew.

               LYNDA
     Tell her to go away, Melvin.

Melvin looks some more.

               MELVIN
     How much you gettin' for 'em?  A
     hundred and twenty?

Nurse Burns clears her throat.  Melvin looks at her nameplate 
heaving on her breast.

               MELVIN 
     Did I ask if you was married, 
     Miss Burns?

               LYNDA
     Melvin!

               MELVIN 
     We'll take 'em.  I'll give you the 
     cash tomorrow.

He snatches the pictures, grabs a pen from her breast pocket, 
scribbles something on the clipboard.

               MELVIN 
     And my boy's name is Faron Dummar.

Hands her the clipboard.

               MISS BURNS
     What a good name.

               MELVIN
     He's a good boy.

Lynda smiles. Miss Burns goes.

               LYNDA
     Melvin?

               MELVIN
     Yes, Lynda? 

               LYNDA
     How's Darcy?

               MELVIN
     She's waiting downstairs.  They 
     won't let her come up.

               LYNDA
     Why not?

               MELVIN
     Hospital rules.

But the first nurse, Miss Crockett, reappears with Faron.

               NURSE CROCKETT
     Dairy-time!

               MELVIN
     Gimme that baby and forget them 
     jokes!

He snatches Faron, carries him gingerly over to Lynda, lays 
him beside her.  She uncovers a breast.

Melvin watches tensely.  The two nurses leave the room.

Now Melvin seems to relax.  He starts to hum, he begins to
sing a lullaby of his own making.

Everything peaceful.  Darcy appears secretively at the door. 
He motions her to come in.  He is still singing as Darcy 
climbs on his lap to watch her mother nurse.


116     EXT. CHURCH OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS - ANAHEIM - NIGHT

Music -- a chorus booming forth with "Now Thank We All Our 
God."


117     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 

The church empty, in the choir loft a chorus of thirty-five 
singers rehearsing.

               CHORUS

singing up a storm.


119     CLOSEUP - BONNIE 

The Cashier at Rockwood Dairy.  Singing and sneaking a
look at Melvin.

     'On earth is not his equal.' 
          (speaks) 
     That's it for tonight, folks. 
     See you on Sunday.

The group breaks up.  Bonnie heads straight for Melvin,
bumping into him accidentally.  They walk to the parking
lot together.


119-A     EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               BONNIE 
     You have a lovely baritone, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     Why thank you, Bonnie.

               BONNIE 
     Everybody thinks so, we're so 
     pleased you joined us.

               MELVIN 
     I dunno, I felt like getting back 
     to the church.  I tried them all 
     when I was a kid, Nazarene, Four 
     Square Gospel, Church of Christ, 
     but Latter Day Saints -- I was 
     born Mormon, you know -- only 
     one ever made me happy.

               BONNIE
     Are you happy now?

               MELVIN 
     Can't seem to get ahead, Bonnie. 
     The job 'n everything, you 
     know -- bought too much car, I
     guess.  Can't stand living under
     the same roof with my mother-in-
     law and not paying the mortgage 
     -- baby clothes, baby furniture --

               BONNIE 
     The Church will help you.

               MELVIN 
     I know, Bonnie.  Mormons are kind. 
     You got that Mormon aura, Bonnie.

They arrive at Melvin's truck.

               MELVIN 
     Well, we'll just keep pluggin'

               BONNIE 
          (radiant) 
     What a beautiful attitude, Melvin.


120     INT. LYNDA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - MORNING

Melvin staggers in wearing his work clothes. The TV is 
switched to "Easy Street."  Mrs. Sisk bustles around.  Baby 
Faron is crying, Darcy is holding him, Lynda sips a drink. 
A neighbor can be seen outside mowing his lawn.

               MELVIN 
     What are you doing?

               LYNDA
     Just a little brandy.  They 
     repossessed the car today.

Melvin shrugs.

               MELVIN 
     It's okay.

               LYNDA
     Sure.

Faron starts to scream. Lynda takes him from Darcy, puts
him on the breast.

Melvin takes off his shirt.

               MELVIN 
     Whaddya got for supper?

               LYNDA
     Bell peppers.

               MELVIN 
     I hate bell peppers.

               LYNDA
     I got bell peppers. How was God
     tonight?

               DARCY
     Ssh! -- it's the Gateway to 'Easy
     Street!'

Melvin's face lights up, looks at the screen.

               DARCY
     Gate number two.

               LYNDA
     Gate number one.

               MELVIN
     Gate number three.


121     TV SET

A Contestant dressed as a lady martian is in agony.

               CONTESTANT
     Gate number three.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Madam, you have entered the Golden 
     Gate!  Inside....

Gate number three revolves, revealing a large boat.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     A Chris Craft with depth finder 
     and ---

Suddenly, Melvin jumps out of his chair.


121-A     HOLLYWOOD - TVC STUDIOS - DAY

Melvin and Lynda run through the main gate to TVC Studios, 
late.  They rush towards the rear entrance of a sound stage,
following the signs pointing to "Easy Street:"

               LYNDA
          (running) 
     I'll never do it.

               MELVIN 
          (pulling her along)
     You'll do it.  I got confidence in
     you.  Now remember, once you're at 
     the Gateway, keep on betting up. 
     Settle for nothing.

They enter the stage door and find themselves:


122     OMITTED


123     INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

Passing ballerinas, comics, rope dancers, torch singers, 
jugglers, jews harp players putting last minute touches on 
their act, signing releases.

               LYNDA
     But suppose I'm a few hundred 
     dollars ahead, my God, think what 
     we could do with a few hundred 
     dollars.

               MELVIN
     Try a few thousand?!  Try them on 
     for size!  We'll be flying to
     Hawaii with cash besides!  Be bold,
     baby!

               LYNDA
     Baby?

               MELVIN 
     We're in show business now.

123-K     ON STAGE

Humiliated, Act # Two leaves the stage.  Wally approaches the
mike.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Now, from Anaheim, California, 
     Mrs. Lynda Dummar, you are on!

123-L     LYNDA

Down the ramp from the clapping audience, Lynda takes the

123-M     WALLY

races from the wings as Lynda completes her act.  He leads 
her to the dias, turning to the audience.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     How about Lynda Dummar, ladies and
     gentlemen?


123-N     THE AUDIENCE

loved her. Wild applause.  Melvin, amongst them, trying to 
catch his breath.


124     ON STAGE 

Wally presents Lynda with the check for $500.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Now Lynda -- do you want to keep 
     your five hundred dollars or do 
     you want to bet it for what's behind 
     one of the three gates to Easy 
     Street?

Lynda looks at the Gateway, then at the money in Wally's hand.


125     MELVIN - IN THE AUDIENCE

trying valiantly to get Lynda's attention.  Nodding his head
like a marionette.  The audience yelling "No!  No!"

               LYNDA 
          (tranced)
     Okay.

Wally leads Lynda by the hand to the Big Gateway.


126     AUDIENCE 

Melvin is signalling like crazy, raising three fingers, 
throwing the three fingers at Lynda.

Lynda looking from gate #1 to gate #2 to gate #3, the audience 
squealing advice.


127     MELVIN - IN AUDIENCE 

flailing and throwing three fingers at Lynda.

               MELVIN
     Three!! Three!!

Lynda turns to Wally.

               LYNDA 
     Two.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Gate number two...Carol!

Carol draws the curtain.  The Announcer's voice comes over.

               ANNOUNCER (v.o.) 
     The Sonny James Living Room Suite 
     by Berkline!

The model starts walking around the living room set.

     with tufting in the seats and backs
     for deep-down comfort.  Complete

Lynda jumps up and down.  Suddenly the air is filled with 
Bonus Golden Gate Fanfare.  The audience goes insane.


128     MELVIN - IN THE AUDIENCE

               MELVIN
     That's my wife!


129     ON STAGE

Wally and Lynda hugging.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Lynda, you've done it!  You've 
     opened the Golden Gate!  The 
     Golden Gate to Easy Street!  Look 
     what else you've won.

Carol drives a golf cart on stage towing a piano.

               ANNOUNCER (v.o.)

     Console -- including hand-carved
     cabinetry, grand-style side-hinged
     top and grand lyre.  From Kimball
     ...It retails for...$1,700!

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
          (to a staggered Lynda) 
     And with that new piano, you're 
     probably gonna wanna have it tuned
     and take lessons.  So you'll need
     a tuning fork and some sheet music, 
     so to take care of those expenses 
     take a look at the rest....

The revolve turns to reveal the flashing light board, which 
is flashing.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     $10,000 in cash! 
          (applause) 
     That makes the total value of your

          (applause)


130      MELVIN - IN AUDIENCE

falling off his chair.


131     ON STAGE

Music, applause, commotion, the credits rolling, Wally being 
kissed by a frantic Lynda, everybody taking bows.

               WALLY WILLIAMS 
     Do you know what you're going to 
     do with the money, sweetheart?

               LYNDA
     I sure do know what I'm going to do 
     with the money.


132     INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - ANAHEIM - DAY

Melvin and Lynda are seated beside scale models of two houses. 

               REAL ESTATE MAN
     So which'll it be?  The Landlord?!
     Or the Sentinel.

               MELVIN
     The Landlord!

               LYNDA
     How much are they again?

               REAL ESTATE MAN
          (elated) 
     The Landlord is 59,900! 
          (depressed) 
     And the Sentinel is 44,300.

               LYNDA
     We'll take the Sentinel.

               MELVIN 
     Now wait a minute, honey --

               LYNDA
     I won the goddamn money!  And we're 
     going to live in the goddamn Sentinel! 

Go out on the fallen faces of Melvin and the Real Estate Man.


133     EXT. THE SENTINEL - ANAHEIM - DAY 

A little house in a development on a quiet street.


134     INT. HOUSE - DAY

All the rooms empty but for the living room where the Sonny 
James living room suite by Berkline is laid out.

It doesn't look as good here.

                              
135     ANOTHER ANGLE - LIVING ROOM - DARCY AND LYNDA

seated on the window sill, a pad and a pencil and some 
figures laid out in front of them.

               LYNDA
     If we're very, very careful ---

               DARCY
     Do I get the tap dancing lessons?

               LYNDA
     I think so.

               DARCY
     And my Girl Scout uniform?

               LYNDA
     I think we'll have to wait on that 
     til next month, honey.


136     EXT./INT. HOUSE - DAY - DARCY'S POINT OF VIEW

looking out the window.

               DARCY
     Here comes Daddy.

Melvin rolls into the driveway, driving a Cadillac which
pulls a boat cradle.  On it rests a twenty-five-foot outboard.


137     EXT. HOUSE - DAY - LYNDA 

dazed by the sight of Melvin's possessions, staggers outside
with Faron in her arms.

Over the fence, the neighbors are having a barbecue.  The 
mother is taking pictures.

               MELVIN 
     Hey, Ortiz!  Give us a picture!

Mrs. Ortiz swings her camera around.  Melvin poses proudly by 
the boat and the new car.  Darcy and Lynda and Faron creep out 
to explore them.

Now Lynda straightens up.

               LYNDA 
          (suddenly)
     Take 'em back, Melvin!

               MELVIN 
     I can't, I'd lose my down payment.

Melvin, with great proprietariness, slaps the fender of the
Cadillac.

               MELVIN 
     We got a lotta horses here, honey.


138     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY - MELVIN

is at the tiller of his boat.  He wears a duck-billed cap,
and in clipped tones is addressing a CB.

               MELVIN 
     Come in Long Beach, come in...come 
     in Long Beach Coast Guard, this is 
     Country Roads ---

He looks up as the back door of the house opens, Lynda is
holding a suitcase in one hand, Faron in the other.  A taxi
appears at the end of the driveway.

               MELVIN 
     Where you goin'?

               LYNDA
     I'm leaving you, Melvin.

               MELVIN 
     You can't leave me ---

               LYNDA
     Oh yes I can ---

               MELVIN 
     You leave me now, I'm never takin' 
     you back, Lynda.

               LYNDA
     I'm never coming back.  And remember,
     half of the house is mine.  I spoke
     to the real estate man ---

               MELVIN 
     It was me got you on the show.

               LYNDA
     It was me won the money -- I get
     half.

               MELVIN 
     You're gettin' nuthin'!

               LYNDA 
     Melvin, you're an asshole ---

               MELVIN 
     Don't call me no asshole ---

               LYNDA
     Then what are you?!  The first 
     time we have a prayer of getting 
     ahead, you go out and buy a big 
     fancy car, a big, fancy boat ---

               MELVIN 
     You can't take it easy on 'Easy 
     Street.' 

               LYNDA 
     Huh?

Melvin turns to Darcy.

               MELVIN 
          (to Darcy) 
     You like this boat, Darcy?

               DARCY 
     I do, Daddy.

               MELVIN 
     You like that car?

               DARCY
     I love it, Daddy.

               LYNDA
     Cut it out, Melvin ---

               MELVIN 
     I seen cars like that boil by on 
     the way from Reno to Vegas when I
     was a little kid.  I'd be cleanin'
     out the goddam tar heater while my
     father was layin' road for them to
     drive by on, and now I've got one!

               LYNDA
     You got me cryin', Melvin.

               MELVIN 
     Don't make fun, Lynda.

               LYNDA
     We're poor, Melvin -- poor!

               MELVIN 
     Lynda, we're on Easy Street.

               LYNDA
     I'm on Easy Street!  I won!

Melvin climbs down from the boat.  There is a terrible silence. 
It seems for the moment as if he might hit her.  But he can't.

               MELVIN 
     Lynda -- don't go ---

She puts Faron down, turns back to him.

               LYNDA
     Melvin, you are an asshole -- but 
     I love you.

               MELVIN 
     Now wait a minute ---

               LYNDA
     Aw, c'est la vie.

               MELVIN
     What does that mean?

               LYNDA
     It's French.  I used to dream I'd 
     be a French interpreter.

               MELVIN 
     You don't speak French ---

               LYNDA
     I told you it was a dream.

She goes.  Melvin watches emptily as Lynda climbs into the
taxi with Faron.  Darcy comes running out of the house.

               DARCY
     G'bye, Daddy.  Will I see you?

               MELVIN 
     You'll see me, honey.

Darcy chases out front and the taxi disappears with Darcy 
waving to Melvin through the rear window.


139     INT. HOUSE - SUNSET - MELVIN

shuffles through the back door, into the living room of 
"Easy Street" furniture. It is well battered now -- he 
slumps in a chair.

               CB RADIO
          (from the boat
          outside)
     'Hello there, Country Roads, small 
     craft warning from Point Dume to 
     the Mexican border, barometric 
     pressure twenty-two point nine....'


139-A     EXT. LOS ANGELES - FREEWAYS - NIGHT 

Zoom in on a milk truck.


139-B     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - ROCKWOOD TRUCK

pulling up to a curb, Melvin hustling out, juggling cartons 
of milk in a container, working two or three houses at once.


139-C     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

leaving gallons of milk on tops of cars, in baby strollers, 
all the appointed places.  Sweating, running, hustling.


139-D     EXT. MRS. WORTH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Melvin rushing up with his delivery. From out of the dark-
ness ---

               MRS. WORTH
     Is that you, Melvin?

Melvin stops.

               MELVIN 
     Yes, ma'am.

She appears at the doorway in her bathrobe.

               MRS. WORTH
     I thought it was you.

               MELVIN 
     Yes, ma'am, two quarts of Hy-line, 
     a Garden Cottage and 25-pound 
     laundry compound.

               MRS. WORTH
     Sounds right, Melvin.  Wouldn't you
     like a nice hot cup of coffee.

               MELVIN
     Oh I dunno, ma'am -- I got my whole
     route ahead of me.

               MRS. WORTH
     It's cold out, Melvin -- don't you 
     want a cup of coffee?

Melvin looks back at his truck.

               MRS. WORTH
     A nice-hot-cup-of-coffee.

Melvin takes a deep breath.

               MELVIN 
     Well, don't mind if I do, Mrs. Worth.

               MRS. WORTH
     Melva. 

               MELVIN 
     Melva.


139-E     MELVIN

He brings her order inside.

               MRS. WORTH
     Melva -- Melvin -- get it?

Melvin smiles.

               MELVIN
     Yes, ma'am, I do.

She turns around.

               MELVIN
     I mean Melva.

She pours some coffee, sets it on the kitchen table.

               MRS. WORTH
     Cream?

               MELVIN
     Yes, ma'am.

               MRS. WORTH
     Sugar?

He looks at her, her parted bathrobe.

               MELVIN
     Four.

She scoops them in.  They sit down.

They drink in silence, Mrs. Worth watching Melvin.

               MRS. WORTH 
     Why don't we take our coffee in-
     side?  Where it's warmer.  Would 
     that suit you, Melvin?

               MELVIN 
     Suits me fine.


139-F     MRS. WORTH

leads the way into a May Company living room.  They sit.

               MELVIN
          (brightly)
     Where's Mr. Worth today?

               MRS. WORTH 
     He's working graveyard.  He won't
     be home for an hour.

               MELVIN 
     A tough shift, graveyard.

               MRS. WORTH 
     He doesn't have any choice.  Neither 
     do I.  If you know what I mean, 
     Melvin.

               MELVIN
     Yes, ma'am, I do.

               MRS. WORTH 
     Makes for a long night.

               MELVIN 
     You bet.

               MRS. WORTH 
     I thought you'd never come, Melvin. 
     I lay in bed waiting all night. 
     Then finally -- you came.

               MELVIN
     Yes, I did.

Melvin smiles.

               MELVIN 
     You got any more coffee there, Melva?

               MRS. WORTH 
     Do you want any more coffee, Melvin?

               MELVIN 
     No, Melva, I don't.

               MRS. WORTH 
     So what do you say, Melvin?

               MELVIN 
     You know what I say, Melva?

               MRS. WORTH
     What?

               MELVIN
     Let's get to it.

floor.

rushing outside, buttoning pants, Mrs. Worth reaching the 
door with him.

               MRS. WORTH
     Don't forget tomorrow, Melvin.  A
     quart of Lo-Fat and a pound of 
     Nippy Cheddar.

               MELVIN
     Yes, ma'am!

He leaps into his truck, Mrs. Worth disappears inside.  Melvin
drives off:

139-I     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY - ON MELVIN

hustling into a house with an order.  Hustling out.


140     EXT. ROCKWOOD DAIRY - LOCKERS - DAY

Christmas lights strung around the lockers.  Melvin unloading 
full cases of milk, tamping ice around them.

His movements are slower now, the enthusiasm is gone.  Some 
ice won't chop for him.  He leaves it in a block on top of 
the milk.  It perches precariously.


141     INT. ROCKWOOD DAIRY - JIM DELGADO'S OFFICE - A CHRISTMAS TREE 

on Jim's desk.  Melvin looking through it at Jim.

               JIM 
     After 'Easy Street,' you paid us 
     a thousand dollars.  Rather, your
     wife did.  You still owed us twenty-
     four hundred. That's back to thirty-
     four now --

               MELVIN
     No kiddin'?

               JIM 
     I've got a note here for 3500 dollars 
     -- plus another note for 2500 -- the 
     balance you owe us on the truck --

               MELVIN 
     I told you about that truck!

               JIM 
     On your uniforms, 250 dollars --
     we'll take that out of next week's
     earnings -- a total of six thousand 
     and fifty dollars -- Sign where the 
     x's are ---

He passes some papers over to Melvin.  Melvin reads them
quietly. Bonnie enters and delivers some paperwork to Jim.

               MELVIN 
     You got me paying a hundred and
     ninety-five dollars a week interest
     -- for God's sake -- I'll never 
     catch up ---

               JIM 
     It's up to you, Melvin.

Melvin blinks.

               MELVIN 
     I got to get me another job.

               JIM
     Wherever you go, you'll be working 
     for us.

Melvin bends his head over the paper.

               JIM
     Did you sell your boat?

               MELVIN 
     I sold it.

               JIM
     What about the Cadillac?

               MELVIN 
     They took it.

               JIM
     That's right they did, didn't they? 
     Well you just got to hustle a little
     more, kid ---

Bill looks up at the route map behind him.

               JIM 
     We got Ralph over here in Artesia --
     he could use a little help ---

               MELVIN 
     My God, that's clear across the 
     county -- I can't make it, Bill, 
     the milk gets warm --

               JIM 
     Get up a little earlier.

               MELVIN
     I'm up at 2 now --

               JIM 
          (shakes his head
          sincerely)
     Tough.

               MELVIN
     I used to collect in the afternoon. 
     I don't even have time to get my
     money out of my customers.  You got
     me running in circles ---

               JIM 
     Planning's the name of the game. 
     You got to organize your time, 
     Melvin.

Bill waits.  Now he holds out his hand, Melvin signs the
papers which are well-crumpled.  Hands them over.

               MELVIN
          (sags, tries 
          to brighten) 
     'We'll keep plugging.'


142     LA HABRA - TIKI RESTAURANT

A Polynesian place, strobe-lite and palms and grass skirts.
Christmas trees, a Christmas party.

Familiar faces from The Rockwood Dairy dancing up a storm, 
the music loud.

Melvin gets up, goes to a pay telephone.  Dials, drops coins.

               MELVIN
     Lynda?

               LYNDA 
     Hello, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     How're you doin'?

Lynda is back home in Anaheim with Mother, Darcy is there and 
so is the dog "Tramp."

               LYNDA 
     I'm doing okay. What do you want,
     Melvin.

               MELVIN
     I was calling about Christmas.

               LYNDA
     Oh yeah, Christmas.

               MELVIN
     What does Darcy want?

               LYNDA
     I'm getting her a Barbi. You can
     get her Ken.

Silence.

               MELVIN
     How about Faron? I was thinking
     about an airgun.

               LYNDA
     Faron's nine months old, Melvin.

Silence.

               MELVIN
     Lynda?

               LYNDA
     Yeah?

               MELVIN
     You still there?

               LYNDA
     I'm still here.

Silence.  Jim Delgado approaches, waits impatiently as 
Melvin resumes his conversation.

               LYNDA
     Melvin, tell you what -- you buy 
     Darcy what you wanna buy her --
     and I'll buy her what I wanna buy 
     her -- okay?

               MELVIN
     I was hoping you'd say that.

               LYNDA
     Good-bye, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     Good-bye, Lynda.

Melvin hangs up slowly, turns to Jim.

               JIM 
     You said you were a big Country 
     and Western singer -- we built our 
     entertainment around you -- Are you 
     going to or aren't you, Melvin?

               MELVIN
     I'm sorry, Jim, I don't feel like
     singing tonight.

               JIM
     I knew you'd crap out.

               MELVIN 
     Now wait a minute ---

               JIM
     Never mind, Ralph will whistle 
     through his belly button.

Jim walks off.

144     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

seated in a corner by himself. One of the drivers comes over,
Ralph.

               RALPH
     Gee, Mel, we heard you wasn't going 
     to sing ---

               MELVIN 
     New Year's maybe ---

               RALPH
     I told my wife you sang Country. 
     She's crazy for Country.

               MELVIN 
     I'm real sorry, Ralph.  And tell 
     your wife I'm sorry too, will you?

Another old-timer comes by, George, a veteran of the driver's
locker room.

               GEORGE 
     Delgado was saying how you was 
     yellow ---

               MELVIN 
     Did he?

               GEORGE 
     I said if Melvin don't want to sing, 
     that's his right.

               MELVIN
     What'd he say?

               GEORGE 
     It's not what he says, Melvin.
     It's what he don't say, y'know
     what I mean?

There is a sudden fanfare from the band.


145     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STAGE

Jim Delgado at the microphone.

               JIM
     Ol' Melvin Dummar promised us a 
     song tonight -- but I'm afraid --
     or am I thrilled? -- he's chickened 
     out.

Melvin stands up.

               MELVIN
     Who says?! I got a song!  I got a
     song right here!

Applause and cheers as Melvin makes his way to the stage.

               JIM
     I guess I had it wrong -- take it, 
     Melvin.

Melvin moves out in front of the band.

               MELVIN 
     These Japs here probably don't 
     know 'Six Days On the Road.'
          (turns to
          the band) 
     You know 'Six Days On the Road?'

They shake their heads.

               MELVIN 
     Well this song I written is sung
     to 'Six Days On the Road.'  And
     now I'm going to sing it.

He grabs a guitar from a startled Polynesian musician.

               MELVIN 
          (sings) 
     Well I pulled out of Rockwood
     Headed down the Santa Ana Freeway
     I got my Divco wound up and 
     I guess it's running okay.

     Well I know it's the middle of the night
     But heck that's all right 
     'Cause I'm a milkman for Rockwood, 
     So everything's okay.

     Well my truck's kind of old 
     And man it's awful slow 
     The temperature is hot and the oil 
          pressure is low 
     If I make it to my route tonight 
     Everything will be all right 
     Ten hours on the road -- I just hope I 
     Make it home by tonight.


146     ON THE AUDIENCE

They are getting with it, starting to clap in rhythm.


147     ON MELVIN 

He looks toward Jim.

               MELVIN
          (singing) 
     I know Jim Delgado will be checking 
          my books today 
     'Cause a big milk bill he said I 
          have to pay 
     But that don't bother me tonight 
     'Cause I can dodge ol' Jim all right 
     Twelve hours on the road I just hope 
          I make it home today. 

     Well it seems like the price of milk 
          gets higher every day -- 
     But us poor milkmen don't get no 
          raise in pay ---

The guys boo along with their wives.  Jim doesn't smile. 
Melvin smiles down at his friends, looks to them as he sings. 
The crowd is really with him.

Melvin spots Bonnie down in the audience.  She is smiling up 
at him worshipfully.  He sings to her now.

               MELVIN
          (singing) 
     Well it seems like a week since I 
          left my house last night 
     You know I could have a lot of 
          women but somehow it don't seem right 
     Yeah I could find some to hold me tight 
          but I'd never make my deliveries all right 
     Fourteen hours on the road man I hope 
     I make it home today.

The place is absolutely quiet now, the people all on his side. 
Melvin sees Jim Delgado leave. He points at him.

Melvin takes it real slow for a finish.

               MELVIN 
          (singing) 
     Now I work like a dog trying to
          collect my pay
     But all my customers say -- can't 
          you come back some other day 
     Boy I just know that there's an
          easier way
     Twenty hours on the road I just know 
          I'm going to make it home today.

Dead silence, then applause and cheering erupts.  Melvin is 
shy on the stage, his friends, Pete and Ralph and George rush
over to him, lift him off the stage, the band strikes up --
Bonnie rushes to Melvin.

She throws her arms around him.

               MELVIN 
          (all embarrassed) 
     Hey, that was nice.  You married, 
     Bonnie?

Bonnie steps away from Melvin, looks him in the eye.

               BONNIE
     No I'm not, Melvin Dummar.  And
     neither are you any more.

Melvin waits.

               BONNIE
     So what do you say?

               MELVIN 
          (shrugs) 
     Gee, I don't know, Bonnie.

               BONNIE
     I'll take care of you, Melvin --
     til you get on your feet. I got my
     kid's child support money saved up ---

               MELVIN 
     You got kids, Bonnie --- ?

               BONNIE
     I got two kids ---

               MELVIN 
     Oh my Lord ---

               BONNIE
     Listen, Melvin, I got a cousin up 
     in Utah -- lost his lease on a gas
     station -- we run it right we get 
     a thousand a month clear -- I've 
     been waiting for this moment -- and 
     the moment is now -- so what do you 
     say?!

Melvin hesitates.

               BONNIE
     Or don't you come swinging your 
     dick around the cashier's office 
     no more!

               MELVIN 
     Bonnie?  A Mormon girl -- swearing?!

               BONNIE
     Bet your ass!

Melvin looks over at Jim Delgado who is dancing with a 
Japanese hostess.  Melvin shakes his head.

               MELVIN 
     When do we leave?

               BONNIE
     Tonight.


148     EXT. SERVICE STATION - WILLARD, UTAH - DAY

Melvin's milk truck rolls in with a U-Haul behind it.  The 
U-Haul is jammed with bedding, Melvin's "Easy Street" 
furniture, the Kimball French Provincial piano, a goat, a
lamb, and some rabbits.  Bonnie tumbles out with her two tow-
headed kids.

Melvin leads the goat out, ties it to one of the gas pumps. 
He looks around, exhilarated by the new surroundings, the 
sense of a fresh start.


149     EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 

Melvin hustling around the pumps, handling two cars at once,
flipping hoods, washing windows, collecting cash.  Terry and
Bonnie help out.

               DRIVER 
          (smiling) 
     You're goin' to get a coronary running 
     around like that.

               MELVIN
     Better than starving to death!

He grabs the man's cash, locks up the pumps now.  The man 
drives off and Melvin trudges up to the house behind the 
station.


150      INT. MELVIN'S HOUSE - DAY

A pathetic place, the "Easy Street" furniture squeezed
in on top of the Kimball piano.  A television set drones away.

The telephone rings.  Melvin and Bonnie look at each other. 
Bonnie grabs the phone.

               BONNIE 
          (on phone) 
     I'm sorry, Mr. LaMar, Mr. Dummar 
     is in Salt Lake today.  Yessir, 
     yessir, I understand -- yes, I'll 
     give him the message.

She hangs up.

               BONNIE 
     He's not going to make the gasoline 
     delivery next week -- unless he has 
     a check.

               MELVIN
     Well, we'll give him a check.

               BONNIE 
     What check?

               MELVIN
     Well, I can't pump gas unless I 
     give 'em a check, can I, honey?

               BONNIE 
     But our check's no good, Melvin.

               MELVIN
     Easter weekend.  Oughta pump a
     thousand gallons.  Give 'em a check 
     tomorrow, we'll have it covered by 
     Monday.
          (back to the TV) 
     Hey, look at this, ol' Howard
     Hughes died.  That's too bad.

               MELVIN
     Sure didn't look anything like that.

               BONNIE
     Well, why would he?   Those pictures 
     are 40 years old.

               SHARON

          kids)
     When are we going to eat, Ma?

               BONNIE
     In a minute, honey, in a minute.

Bonnie gets up and moves to the stove.  The TV is droning on. 
Melvin sniffs.

               MELVIN
     Chicken?

               BONNIE
     This time, don't tell me how Lynda's
     is better.

Terry, a teen-age helper, rolls out from under a car.

     Sure we got cigarettes.  What kind 
     of cigarettes you like?

               VENTURA
     Uh -- Camels.

               MELVIN 
     Camels?  We don't get much call for 
     them -- that's a real cigarette.
     Nowadays they want brown ones or 
     thin ones or long ones, lo-tar, 
     no-tax -- lemme see --
          (reaches
          into rack)
     There you go.

Ventura hands him a dollar.  Melvin goes to make change.

     Vegas ---

               MELVIN 
     Catch Interstate 15, take her
     right on through ---

Melvin hands him the change, sits back down to his books. 
Terry can be seen outside.

               VENTURA 
          (watching Melvin)
     I heard I could get 6 and 50, takes 
     me over the line, and then head 
     south ---

Stays with his book.

               VENTURA

     Gee, it's nice to meet you again,
     Fred -- I haven't seen you since I
     met you at your mom's wedding --

Vans pulling away, cars pulling away, reporters vanishing.

Melvin pumping gas again, comes around to collect money from 
a Driver.  He's the same suspicious individual seen earlier 
in the crowd.

               MELVIN 
     That'll be four-fifty.

The door opens slightly.  The Driver pulls a gun.

               DRIVER
     You remember me, Melvin?  I was
     with you.  We were all together.
     You and me and Howard.  But it was 
     me that give him the quarter!

Melvin slams the door on the Driver's arm, the gun fires and 
shatters the car window, Melvin wrestles the Driver from the 
car, pinning him to the ground. Terry and Bonnie jump into 
the scuffle.

     I think that's enough for tonight, 
     Bonnie.

He gets up.

               BONNIE

Intercut:

               LYNDA
     God, Melvin, what happened?

               MELVIN
     I dunno.  I guess that old wino
     really was Howard Hughes.

Silence.

               LYNDA
     Are you all right, Melvin?

               MELVIN
     Yeah, I'm all right.  How's Darcy?

Faron and Darcy.  Beside them, Bonnie with her children. 
Other spectators, Lucy from Reno, Little Red, Mrs. Worth, 
Tina from the Cottonwood Ranch and Fred Smith.


209     ON THE BENCH 

Judge Hayes, a short, unhealthy-looking young man.  He bends 
down towards Melvin.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Melvin, turn your chair around and 
     face me.

Melvin turns his chair around.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Are you lying, Melvin?

               MELVIN
     No, sir.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Melvin, I want you to know there is 
     a still, small voice that many 
     people are blessed with that tells 
     them when the truth is being spoken. 
     It has been said, 'What doth it 
     profit a man if he gain the whole
     world yet lose his own soul?'  If
     you are lying, Melvin, which you 
     are, in my opinion, your soul may 
     be in jeopardy, but I am not con-
     cerned about your soul, Melvin, 
     right now I am concerned about your 
     hide, because if I find that you 
     are lying before this Court, I will 
     make it a special duty to have a 
     piece of your hide.  I will direct 
     that the district attorney bring a 
     criminal prosecution against you and 
     I will make it my special project 
     that if you are convicted I will 
     recommend that you do prison time. 
     And I want you to know Nevada State
     Prison is no country club like the
     Gabbs local jail or wherever you 
     have served time.  If you're lying,
     you're going straight to Nevada 
     State Prison.  All right, Melvin?

               MELVIN
     You bet, Your Honor.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Brother Dummar, I want the truth.
     Where did that will come from?

               MELVIN
     A man brought it to the station.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     You persist in the answers that
     were elicited from you this morning?

               MELVIN
     I do, Your Honor.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Do you know who wrote the will?

               MELVIN
     I do not know.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Did you in any way participate in 
     the preparation of that will?

               MELVIN
     No, I did not.

               JUDGE HAYES
     Do you know of anyone else who
     participated in the preparation 
     of that will?

               MELVIN
     No, I don't.

The Judge looks down at the battery of lawyers.  He sighs.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Gentlemen, I've done my best.

     You hold on to Faron, honey.  Give
     your mama a rest.

Darcy takes Faron.

               LYNDA 
     What happens now?

               MELVIN
     I got to face the meanest lawyer 
     in the whole damn world.


211     INT. COURTROOM

Harvey Maxwell, an urbane five-foot seven-inch man from Los
Angeles, is examining Melvin.

               MAXWELL 
     How did you open the envelope?

               MELVIN
     Steamed it open.

               MAXWELL 
     Why didn't you take a knife or a 
     letter opener and open it the way 
     everybody else opens an envelope?

               MELVIN
     I was scared.

               MAXWELL 
     What were you scared of?

               MELVIN
     That it might actually be true.

               MAXWELL 
     Why was that frightening?

               MELVIN
     I don't know.

               MAXWELL 
     Had you ever performed this little
     act before of steaming open an
     envelope?

               MELVIN
     Yes.

               MAXWELL 
     What were the occasions for this 
     activity?

               MELVIN
     Looking at letters that my ex-wife 
     had written to her boyfriend and 
     what have you, before she could
     mail them.


212     LYNDA

She smiles at Melvin reassuringly.  Syvella raises the sign.


213     ON MELVIN AND MAXWELL

               MAXWELL
     Why did you take the will to the 
     church?

               MELVIN 
     Because I was too afraid to take it 
     anywhere else.

               MAXWELL
     Say that again.

Melvin hesitates.

               MELVIN 
     I thought they would help me.

               MAXWELL
     Mr. Dummar, you believe, do you 
     not, that if in the name of God, 
     you lie, God will hear you and 
     you will incur his wrath.  You 
     believe that don't you, Mr. Dummar?

               MELVIN 
     Yes, I do.

Suddenly Maxwell darts across the room, snatches up from the 
counsel desk a weather-beaten Bible.

               MAXWELL
     Mr. Dummar, I have a Bible here. 
     Please stand up.

Melvin stands.

               MAXWELL
     Put your hand on it, raise your 
     right hand.

Melvin raises his hand.

               MAXWELL
     Do you swear before God that this
     story about how that will was left
     to you is the truth?

               MELVIN
     I do.

               MAXWELL
     All right, sit down.

Melvin sits.

               MAXWELL
     That's all for now.  Mr. Frost?

Frost, a Los Angeles lawyer for Hughes' relatives, heads 
straight for Melvin.

               FROST
     Can you give me one reason on earth 
     why this strange man would have left 
     that will with you, Melvin Dummar?

               MELVIN
     No, I don't.  I've been wondering
     that myself.

               FROST
     Did you come up with an answer?

               MELVIN
     No, I haven't.

               FROST
     Melvin, isn't it true you can't 
     come up with an answer because it
     never happened that way?

               MELVIN  
     That is the way it happened.

               FROST
     Well, Melvin, if it meant eternal 
     damnation in hell would you just 
     say it still happened that way?

               MELVIN  
     Yes, I would.

               FROST
     Melvin, you know, don't you, that 
     perhaps other than your relatives,
     there is nobody in this courtroom
     who believes you.  You know that,
     don't you?

               MELVIN 
     I don't know what people believe. 
     And I don't care.  People have
     been calling me an asshole all my
     life.  And it don't matter either
     way.

The courtroom erupts, Judge Hayes slams his gavel. 

Melvin leans back.  Darcy waves.  Melvin waves back.

               FROST 
     Let's go back to when you got the
     will, and everybody celebrated and
     you were a national hero, Melvin. 
     And they asked you about your
     getting over a hundred million
     dollars and I think you sobbed, 
     choked, went into a sort of deep, 
     heavy mood.  I was kind of caught 
     by it as I watched it on TV, but 
     then my wife said, 'My God, it is 
     just like the women on the game
     shows!'  I don't watch the game
     shows myself, but soon after I 
     learned you had gotten your wife
     on one.

Melvin looks at Lynda.  She waves.

               FROST
     Let's go through the Golden Gate
     together, Melvin.  Tell us the real
     truth.  I know the dream is so much 
     better -- My God, I was a child in 
     Minnesota during the Depression and 
     I can remember, kind of hoping one 
     of those trucks going by might have
     a box of chewing gum on it and it 
     would fall off.  That was the dream 
     -- it never happened.  And I never 
     tried to make it happen.

Frost takes a deep breath.

               FROST
     Let's make a deal, Melvin.  Tell 
     us the truth and you know what I'll 
     give you -- I'll plead in your be-
     half a whole day to have the judge 
     give you probation.  But if you don't 
     tell the truth, I'll do my utmost 
     to see you never breathe another 
     free breath in the state of Nevada.

Silence.

               JUDGE HAYES 
     Mr. Dummar, do you wish to make any 
     response to what I would characterize 
     as an offer from Mr. Frost?

               MELVIN 
     I would like to say I don't know if
     the will is a forgery or not.  If
     it is, I didn't do it.  And if it
     isn't --
          (shrugs) 
     I guess it's for real.

               FROST
     That's no deal, Melvin.

               MELVIN 
     I know that. 

               FROST
     And I'm sorry. 

               MELVIN 
     Yes, sir.

Frost stalks back to the counsel table.  He is exhausted. 
Pilbrow, another lawyer, rises unsteadily.  Looks at Melvin.

     You did it, Melvin.  The Judge set 
     a trial for July 6 ---

               MELVIN
     What does that mean?

               ROGER
     That means he believes you.  On 
     July 6th, they're going to deter-
     mine the validity of the will. 
     Like he said, 'It's the only will
     we've got,' plus the positive
     testimony by the handwriting ex-
     perts.  I think the will is going
     to be admitted to probate.  You're 
     going to get your inheritance.

               MELVIN
     You think so?

               ROGER
     Of course it's going to be a long,
     long road -- but we've won the
     first battle.  I can tell -- the 
     T-shirt people called again --
     Rockwood Dairy says they'll lift 
     the garnishes on your entire
     earnings at the filling station ---

               MELVIN
     Really?

               ROGER
     The T-shirts are an easy fifteen 
     thousand.  What do you say?

               MELVIN
     No, thanks ---

               ROGER
     But you can use the cash ---

               MELVIN
     You want to get paid?

               ROGER
     No no no -- it's just they started 
     paving the freeway today down from 
     the gas station -- within two weeks, 
     you're going to be pretty lonely up 
     there.

               MELVIN
     Don't worry about me.

Roger sighs.

               ROGER
     Well, you won, Mel --

               MELVIN 
     Then what are you so sad about?

               ROGER
     I just hope you don't have any
     illusions.  They'll fight it 
     through every court they can --
     the relatives -- Summa -- 
     meanwhile the government'll be 
     taking out taxes -- the states'll 
     be taking out taxes -- the 
     lawyers'll be taking out legal 
     fees -- the money's going to 
     be siphoned off --

               MELVIN 
     I knew all that the day I found 
     the will.

               ROGER
     You're kidding.

               MELVIN 
     Melvin Dummar's never going to 
     see 156 million dollars -- in 
     fact he's never going to see 
     a dime.

Melvin closes his suitcase, puts it on a cart and pushes
it out the door.

               MELVIN 
     But Howard Hughes sang Melvin 
     Dummar's song.   Howard Hughes 
     sang 'Santa's Souped Up Sleigh.'

The door slams.

               ROGER
          (bewildered) 
     'Santa's' what, Melvin?

Melvin has gone.


217      EXT. CLARK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Melvin rolls up in Little Red's old car, Lynda is standing
on the sidewalk with Faron and Darcy.

               MELVIN 
     Sorry --

               LYNDA
     It's okay.  Gave me a chance to
     get them fed.  You really want 
     to do this?

               MELVIN
     See my kids?  Get them out of
     that smog?  You kiddin'?

Lynda looks at the car doubtfully.

               MELVIN
     Little Red lent it to me for
     the trip.  He went back up with
     Bonnie in the tow truck. 
          (to Darcy) 
     Hop in, kids.  There's Lifesavers 
     and comic books back there.

Darcy pushes Faron into the back seat.

               MELVIN
     I bought a pair of shoes for 
     Faron -- help him try them on, 
     Sister.

Darcy takes Faron's shoes off.

               MELVIN
     You got money to get back to 
     L.A.?

               LYNDA
     Don't worry about me, Melvin.

               MELVIN
          (smiles) 
     It's in my blood.

               LYNDA
     You're not going to hassle me 
     when I want them back end of
     the summer?

               MELVIN
     You've got my word.

               LYNDA
     That's what I'm afraid of.

               MELVIN 
     Howsa bout you takin' me back
     the end of the summer?

Lynda smiles.

               LYNDA
     You're married, Melvin.

Melvin shrugs.

               MELVIN 
     So are you.

Lynda smiles again.

               LYNDA
     I do miss it sometimes, Melvin 
     -- it was always exciting.
     Lousy -- but exciting.

               MELVIN 
     We could make it that way again.

               LYNDA
     It is now.

Lynda smiles once more.

               LYNDA
     Give us a kiss.

She kisses him hard.  He blushes.

               MELVIN
     End of the summer? 

               LYNDA
     Maybe.

Now he piles into the car.

               LYNDA
          (yelling)
     G'bye, kids!

But Darcy is reading a comic book out loud to Faron. They
don't even look up.


218     EXT. TONOPAH HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Melvin rolling along in Little Red's car.  Darcy and Faron
have moved into the front seat, sound asleep.

Melvin rests his hand on Darcy's forehead.


219     ON MELVIN THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Windshield, a raindrop, then another.  Then a sudden 
downpour, a desert shower, stopping almost as soon as it
starts.


220     ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The rain clearing, just a gray sky. He opens the window.
Howard opens his window. They're in Little Red's car.


221     ON MELVIN

breathing in the desert after the shower.

               MELVIN 
     Greasewood.

               HOWARD 
          (breathing in)
     Sage.

               MELVIN 
     Nothing like the smell of the
     desert after the rain.

               HOWARD 
     Greasewood and sage.

They roll along for a while.

               HOWARD 
     How about letting me drive?

               MELVIN 
     You?

               HOWARD 
     Just for a little while.

               MELVIN 
     Drive?

               HOWARD 
     I'm a goddamn good driver ---

               MELVIN 
     You haven't driven a car since 
     they put out the last Hudson.

               HOWARD 
     I'm a goddamn good driver.  I'll 
     bet you.


222     ON MELVIN 

He looks at Howard.


223     ON HOWARD 

waiting.


224      ON MELVIN 

Smiles, pulls off the road.

               MELVIN 
     When we get to Vegas, I'll run 
     her into town.

Howard hesitates.

               MELVIN 
     Take the wheel, ol' timer.

Howard gets out and Melvin slides over.


225     MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Howard looking carefully at the dashboard.  Very slowly
he puts the car into gear, very slowly he releases the 
brake, and very slowly he rolls it out onto the road.


226      ON MELVIN AND HOWARD

Melvin watching as Howard drives.  Howard watching 
Melvin watching him.  Now Melvin's head begins to nod. 
His eyes close.


227     ON HOWARD

Driving, now he turns, sneaks a look at Melvin who is
sound asleep beside him.  Gives the car a little gas
and begins to sing.

               HOWARD
          (singing quietly) 
     'Make my bed 
     And light the light
     I'll arrive
     Late tonight 
     Blackbird! 
     Blackbird! 
     Bye!  Bye!'

Howard props his arm out the window, adjusts the mirror, 
now he gives the car more gas. 

He is very happy.


228     MELVIN'S CAR 

rolling down the highway to Las Vegas.  From it --

               HOWARD (v.o.)
          (singing)
     'Pack up all my cares and woes 
     Singin' low 
     Here I go 
     Bye bye blackbird....'

The car becomes a dot.  It never disappears, nor does 
the music end.

                    FADE OUT

               THE END
