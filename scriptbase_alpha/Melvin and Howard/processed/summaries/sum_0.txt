This movie tells the possibly true story of Melvin Dummar.
Melvin is a nice guy, but he is a total loser: unlucky, impractical and can't keep a job.
One night, however, he helps an old man who has had a motorcycle accident in the desert.
Melvin laughs when the old man says he is Howard Hughes, the eccentric multimillionaire.
But when Howard Hughes dies, Melvin is mailed a will leaving him part of the estate!
