Los Angeles, 1928.
A single mother returns from work to find her nine-year-old son gone.
She calls the LAPD to initiate a search.
Five months later, a boy is found in Illinois who fits the description; he says he's her son.
To fanfare and photos, the LAPD reunite mother and son, but she insists he's not her boy.
The cops dismiss her as either a liar or hysterical.
When she joins a minister in his public criticism of the police, they in turn use government power to silence and intimidate her.
Meanwhile, a cop goes to a dilapidated ranch to find a Canadian lad who's without legal status; the youth tells a grisly tale.
There's redress for murder; is there redress for abuse of power?
