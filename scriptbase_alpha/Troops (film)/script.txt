            Rapid cuts of Imperial Stormtroopers in and around Mos Eisley flash 
            across the screen. The COPS, theme song "Bad Boys", plays as 
            familiar credit crawl appears on screen.

            EXT. TATOOINE DESERT - DAY
            A Storm trooper sits astride a DEWBACK. Imperial transports can be 
            seen lifting off in the background as he starts his patrol.

            CAPT. JYANIX BAUCH
            JYANIX
            (to camera)
            I joined the empire about six years ago. I can remember as a kid 
            watching the holographic images and being excited about the new 
            direction the galaxy was taking. So when I was old enough I went 
            down to the local recruitment cent and signed up, and I've been here 
            at Tatooine ever since.
            He gives the Dewback a good kick. The animal quickens its pace.
            JYANIX
            (still to camera)
            Most people would call this the ass end of space, but I like the 
            small town feeling you get around here. 
            I mean, we know everybody. EVERYBODY!  
            And I feel I can really make a difference here.
            EXT. TATOOINE DESERT - DAY
            Captain Bauch approaches several JAWAS heading towards a SANDCRAWLER 
            with a DROID. Bauch is joined by to other STORMTOOPERS.
             
            JYANIX
            We've got a routine stop here. We have a report of some stolen 
            droids and we think these might be it.
            The camera follows Bauch as he leaves his mount and joins the other 
            Troopers.
            JYANIX
            Excuses Me. You wanna come over here, please.
            The Jawas look surprised.
            JYANIX
            Yes, I'm talking to you two.
            The Jawas sheepishly walk over to the troopers.
            JYANIX
            Whose droid is this?
            The Jawas answer in their native tongue.
            JYANIX
            Oh, it's your cousins'. Is this your cousin?
            Jyanix turns to the other Jawa #2.
            JYANIX
            Are you his cousin. No. Then who are you?
            The Jawa #2 says something.
            JYANIX
            Oh, you're his friend. Well Mr.Friend would you step over there for 
            a moment please.
            Jyanix turns his attention to the first Jawa. The other Troopers 
            move closer to the second one.
            JYANIX
            (holding back laughter)
            Ok, so the droid belongs to your cousin. If I go over to that 
            sandcrwaler over there and ask to see your cousin, is he gonna have 
            a Bill of Sales for this.
            Jawa #1 answers.
             
            JYANIX
            Ok. Well what I'm gonna do now sir, is place you under Imperial 
            arrest. 
            So it can only help your situation if you tell me the truth.
            Jawa #2 moves in to protest. The other troopers quickly draw their 
            guns on him.
            JYANIX
            (to Jawa#2)
            Hey! Am I talking to you?
            (Pause)
            AM I TALKING TO YOU?!! Then stay over there and shut your mouth!
            Now if you move again I'm gonna shoot you. 
            Jawa #1 starts pleading with Capt. Jyanix.
            JYANIX
            No. Yes, I understand. I've got a wife and kids too, but you don't 
            see me out here stealing imperial droids, do you? 
            (Pause)
            Sure you'll never do it again.
            STORMTOOPER #1
            (yelling)
            He's making a run for it!!
            Camera swished around to see Jawa #2 running across the sand. The 
            two other troopers chase after him, then finally raise their guns 
            and shoot him down.
            The first Jawa, now fearing for his life makes a run in the other 
            direction. The camera follows Jyanix as he shoots the Jawa in the 
            back. 
             
            EXT. TATOOINE DESERT - DAY
            Captain Jyanix faces the camera as the two other Troopers carry away 
            the Jawas. In the background you can see that the sandcrawler that 
            the Jawas were headed to in now on fire.
            JYANIX
            Well, what we had here was that these Jawas had stolen some Imperial 
            property and it unfortunately turned violent. These Jawas do this 
            kind of stuff all the time-picking up stay droids and selling them 
            to the highest paying customer.
            Another Trooper chimes in. The camera focuses in on him.
            TROOPER #1
            We didn't find the droids we were looking for. But, we did find one 
            that a kid had reported stolen. So he and his parents are gonna come 
            down to the detention center and pick it up.
            JYANIX
            Boy, I'll bet they'll be happy.
            TROOPER #1
            Yup. That's what it's all about.
             
            FADE OUT.
             
            PART II
            FADE IN:
            SUPER: TATOOINE, LARS FARM 14:35 IST
            DOMESTIC DISPUTE
            EXT. MOISTURE FARM - DAY
            Several Storm troopers descend on upon a moisture farm. VAPORATORS, 
            several DEWBACKS, and a TROOP TRANSPORT, dot the landscape. The 
            camera follows a Trooper, OFFICER MOTT, as he dismounts and heads 
            towards what appears to be a main dwelling.
            SUPER: OFFICER DAEMOND MOTT
            DAEMOND
            (to camera)
            We've got a call to check out this domestic dispute. Supposedly the 
            husband said something to their kid and now the wife thinks that 
            he's run off... (trailing off) Supposedly one of them's intoxicated 
            and one of them's injured.
            Daemond gives several hand signals to the other Troopers and they 
            disperse-placing themselves in a wide circle around the farm.
            DAEMOND
            We're familiar with this couple. This is not the first time we've 
            been out here, so we're going to see if we can straighten this whole 
            thing out.
            Daemond, approaches the arguing couple, OWEN and BARUE LARS. Barue, 
            hurries over to Mott-MOSAIC DISTORTION CIRCLE hides her face.
            DAMOND
            What's the problem Barue?
            BARUE
            (holding back tears)
            I've just had it. I'VE HAD IT WITH HIM!! He keeps lying to Luke, and 
            me and now Luke's run off, and he hasn't come back, and-
            OWEN
            Oh, now that's just re-
            DAEMOND
            Hey, I'll talk to you in a second. 
            Right now I'm talking to your wife. 
            Ok?
            OWEN
            Ok. Ok.
            Barue leans in over Daemond's shoulder.
            BARUE
            (screaming)
            And Luke's probably dead now cause of you!!
            OWEN
            Oh that's just bullsh--!
            DAEMOND and two other Troopers separate the Lars before they can get 
            at each other.
            DAEMOND
            NOW BARUE JUST CALM DOWN! Calm down. Do you want to be arrested?
            BARUE
            No.
            DAEMOND
            Well now, if you keep this up that's just what I'm gonna haveta do. 
            And you don't want that, do you?
            BARUE
            No.
            DAEMOND
            Ok, then. Are you gonna calm down?
            BARUE
            Yes.
            DAEMOND
            Good. Why don't you start over.
            BARUE
            (rambling)
            Well yesterday Luke, comes in and says, I think those droid-
            DAEMOND
            Now is Luke, your boy.
             
            BARUE
            Nephew. So anyway he says, I think those droids we bought might be 
            stolen. And then HE!-
             
            She points to Owen. He looks like he's going to protest but stops 
            short when the Troopers raise their guns.
            BARUE
            Then he says, well I don't care. Your only concern is to get them 
            working. And then Luke is like, I want to go to the academy this 
            year. And he says well I still need you for the harvest. And then he 
            starts in about Obi-Wan and his father and-
            OWEN
            Oh, I did not!!
            Daemond raises his gun to Owen. Owen shuts up.
            BARUE
            Yes you did! Yes you DID! You're just lying to him You're always 
            lying to him!! You never tell him the truth about him or his 
            SISTER!!
            OWEN
            (gritting his teeth)
            Will you just shut up!
            BARUE
            No, you shut up! I'm tired of shutting up!
            DAEMOND
            You can both shut up, or spend a night in the detention area!
            Both Barue and Owen, stop yelling. Daemond turns his attention back 
            to Barue, The other Troopers give the impression that they've seen 
            this argument one to many times.
            DAEMOND
            So what do you want to do now, Barue?
            BARUE
            I don't know.
             
            DAEMOND
            Do you want us to take you some where so you can get help.
            BARUE
            I don't know.
            DAEMOND
            What do you mean you don't know. 
            You've obviously have a problem otherwise-
            BARUE
            I don't have a problem.
            DAEMON
            Barue, come here. Do you see his ear, how it's cut? It didn't get 
            that way by itself did it?
            BARUE
            No.
            DAEMOND
            And you did that didn't you.
            Barue shakes her head sheepishly in agreement with Daemond.
            DAEMOND
            Yes you did. Now see that tells me you have a problem. And when we 
            get called in then it becomes our problem. And-
            BARUE
            But he was the one wh-
            DAEMOND
            (calming her down)
            Now wait a second, I'm talking. I listened to you, now you listen to 
            me. That's how this works. Ok? Are you going to listen to me?
            Barue shakes her head again.
            DAEMOND
            Now how many times have we been out here? A lot hun? And what did I 
            tell you last time?
            BARUE
            I don't know.
            DAEMOND
            You don't know, or you don't remember?
            Barue mumbles something unintelligible.
            DAEMOND
            Barue. What do you want to do?
            BARUE
            I want you to arrest him!
            DAEMOND 
            I can't arrest him. He hasn't done anything. If there's anybody I 
            should be arresting, it should be you for assault.
            Daemond raises his hands in defeat.
            DAEMOND
            Barue you have two choices here. You can stay here, or we can take 
            you to an Imperial Shelter. What do you want to do?
            Barue shifts from side to side - confused.
            DAEMOND
            Barue? What do you want to do? Do you want us to take you somewhere 
            tonight?
            BARUE
            Yes.
            DAEMOND
            Ok. Do you need to get anything? 
            Some clothes, or something?
            BARUE
            Yes. And you'll find Luke won't you?
            DAEMOND
            Yes will find Luke.
            OWEN
            (quickly)
            Oh, Luke is fine, he's just out working!
            DAEMOND
            Hey, just let it go.
             
            Barue heads back to the house; escorted by two Storm troopers. 
            Daemond makes his way over to Owen.
            OWEN
            Look, she's been under a lot of stress lately. We just lost two more 
            hired hands and we just got a little out of hand.
            DAEMOND
            I know. I know. But right now I think the best thing for both of you 
            is to get some distance from each other for a couple of days.
            OWEN
            I mean I've been telling her to get some help for a long time now.
            DAEMOND
            Well, this is probably the best thing for her right now. You should 
            really have someone look at that ear.
            OWEN
            I'll be fine.
            Camera swish pans to catch Barue arguing with several of the 
            Troopers. They are trying to help here with her bags.
            BARUE
            (yelling)
            Let go. I said LET GO!!
            DAEMOND
            Barue. If you-
            STORMTOOPER
            Look out!! She's got a thermal detonator!
            The Troopers scramble to avoid the blast Daemond raises his rifle to 
            try and knock the detonator out of Barue's hand. As he does, Owen, 
            tries to stop him. Another Stormtooper opens fire Owen, dropping him 
            like a brick as the detonator simultaneously blows up in Barue's 
            hands, charring both of them to a crisp.
            EXT. LARS FARM - DAY
            The now familiar "burning farm scene" fills the screen. Uncle Owen 
            and Aunt Barue, lay in the positions we remember Luke finding them 
            in from the first film. Daemond and the other Troopers are busy 
            packing things up.
             
            DAEMOND
            (to camera)
            Well, things got a bit nasty here. It's unfortunate, but it was 
            almost expected with these people. You know, the farmers out here 
            are having a bad season, tempers are high, and it's just bad for 
            everyone.
            Daemond mounts his Dewback.
            DAEMOND
            The important thing now is that we find their nephew and make sure 
            he's ok.
            STORM TROOPER
            Did she say that they'd just bought some stolen droids?
            Camera follows Daemond and the other Troopers as they ride away.
            DAEMOND
            Damn shame. Damn shame....
            FADE OUT.
