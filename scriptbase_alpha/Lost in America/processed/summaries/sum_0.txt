David and Linda Howard are successful yuppies from LA.
When he gets a job disappointment, David convinces Linda that they should quit their jobs, liquidate their assets, and emulate the movie Easy Rider, spending the rest of their lives travelling around America...in a Winnebago!
(This is a kind of large, luxurious mobile home which suits a 1980's yuppie more than the counterculture dropout approach of Easy Rider.)
His idealized, unrealistic plans soon begin to go spectacularly wrong.
