1     EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Sold sign is posted in front of a house.  SHOT OF SIGN.

                                   CUT TO:

2     INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT

The house is empty except for Bekins boxes which are
packed.  They are all over the rooms. The CAMERA
SLOWLY MOVES IN AND AROUND the boxes until we REACH
the bedroom.

3     INT. BEDROOM

The bed is the only piece of furniture left.  The CAM-
ERA STOPS.  In front of the bed is a small black-and-
white television.  In bed are DAVID and NANCY HOWARD.
Nancy is rolled over on her side.  David is lying on
his back with his eyes wide open.

          DAVID
     Nancy?  Nancy?

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     Sleeping?

          NANCY
     Yes.

          DAVID
     Maybe we shouldn't move.

          NANCY
          (sitting up)
     Oh God.  What's the matter now?

          DAVID
     Nothing.  It's just time to ask
     these questions.

          NANCY
     No.  We've sold our house and
     bought another one.  These
     questions should have been
     asked before.

          DAVID
     Okay, fine.  I can't talk to
     you.  Good night.

David pretends like he's actually going to go to sleep.

          NANCY
          (in a monotone; obvi-
          ously she's had to
          say this many times
          before)
     Stop it.  You're nervous about
     tomorrow.  You'll get your
     promotion, don't worry. We'll
     move into our new house and we'll
     be happy, okay?

          DAVID
     Boy, you should hear yourself.
     The excitement in your voice
     just fills the room.

          NANCY
     Look, I'm tired.  Stop questioning.
     We made a wise decision.  Let's try
     and feel good about it, alright?

          DAVID
     Fine.

          NANCY
     Good night.

          DAVID
     Good night.

Nancy tries to go back to sleep.  David just lies
there.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     But why that house?

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     I think it's too close to here.
     It's going to feel like the same
     place.  Maybe we really didn't
     think about this long enough.

          NANCY
     We thought about it forever.
     We wanted more space.  That
     house has more space.

          DAVID
     Yes, but the point of a house is
     not just space.  You can rent
     space.  Maybe we should've moved
     into a completely different
     neighborhood, a step up or
     something.  Maybe we should've
     gotten a house with a tennis
     court.

          NANCY
     Why?  We don't play tennis.

          DAVID
     Sure we don't play tennis.  We
     don't have a court.  When you
     have a court, you learn.

          NANCY
     Well, possibly some day, we'll
     have a court and then we can
     learn.

          DAVID
     Let me ask you one more question?
     Why did we let Bekins do all of
     our packing?

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     Isn't that a waste of money?  We
     could've packed ourselves.  Maybe
     we were too irresponsible.

          NANCY
     I don't believe you.  One minute
     you want a tennis court, the next
     minute you're worried about Bekins
     packing a box?  My God.  Sometimes
     I wish we really were irresponsible.

          DAVID
     What does that mean?

          NANCY
     Nothing.  Look, get some sleep,
     okay?  You'll feel better.

          DAVID
     Don't assume how I'm feeling.
     What do you mean "nothing"?  If
     you're saying we should be more
     irresponsible, I imagine you mean
     we're too responsible?  Is that
     right?

          NANCY
     Well, sometimes I think that we
     are too controlled, yes.

          DAVID
     Oh, I see.  Well, tell me
     something?  How do you go out
     and buy a four-hundred-thousand-
     dollar house and let a moving
     company pack everything and get
     maids and servants and live the
     good life and not be controlled?

          NANCY
     What are you talking about?

          DAVID
     It doesn't matter what I'm
     talking about.

David gets up.  He takes his pillow with him.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I'm going to sleep in the garage.

          NANCY
     Don't do that.

          DAVID
     Why not?  I'm responsible.  I
     should be guarding the car.

          NANCY
     You're insane.

          DAVID
          (yelling from
          the kitchen)
     You're right.  I am insane.  I
     am insane and I'm responsible.
     A very, very good combination.

We STAY in the bedroom with Nancy.  She lies there.
Her eyes are open.  She's staring straight ahead.  She
looks sad.  After a moment, David reappears at the door.

          DAVID
     I am not an animal.

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     I am not an animal.  I will not
     sleep in the garage.

          NANCY
     Just come to bed.  Come on.

          DAVID
          (sitting down on
          the bed)
     I apologize, okay?  But don't
     call me names.

          NANCY
     What names?

          DAVID
     You know what names.  Calling me
     responsible is saying what?  That
     I'm closed up.  I'm old.  I'm
     stodgy.  That's not fair.  I
     don't like the way things are any
     more than anybody else does but
     what am I supposed to do?  I'm
     trying.  What about you?  You're
     as responsible as I am.  Personnel
     Director for a department store is
     not the most irresponsible job in
     the world.  Go hire anyone you
     want.  Think you'd be fired fast
     if you did that?  How much freedom
     do you have?  We're all in the
     same boat.  We're trying to make
     something of ourselves and it's
     hard.  Okay?

          NANCY
     You're very upset.  I'm sorry I
     used that word.

          DAVID
     No, I'm glad you used that word.
     It's honest but things are going
     to get better.  They're going to
     change.

          NANCY
     You always say that.

          DAVID
     Yes, but this time it's different.
     After tomorrow I'm no longer an
     employee, I'm a Vice President.
     I'll be my own boss.  I'll have
     a piece of the company.  You see
     what I mean?  I can be more
     irresponsible because I'll be in
     a position of responsibility.
     That makes sense, doesn't it?

          NANCY
     I don't know.  I guess it does.
     Good night.

          DAVID
     Okay, go to sleep.

Nancy and David both lie down, each facing the oppo-
site direction.  After a few seconds...

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     It does make sense and things
     will work out, don't you think
     so?

No answer.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Nancy?

No answer.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Asleep already?

No answer.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Maybe men are supposed to fall
     asleep last.  It could be a
     protective thing.

                                   CUT TO:

4     INT. BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

David is brushing his teeth.  He stops for a minute
and looks in the mirror.  He starts talking, pretend-
ing the face he's seeing is the one of his boss.

          DAVID
     What can I say?  I'd be a liar if
     I tell you I'm surprised.  I do
     feel it's deserved but yes, I
     still am flattered... That's very
     nice.  Thank you... Oh, stop,
     please.  I've never been good
     at taking too many compliments
     at once... Well, I feel the
     same way about you.

Nancy walks in during this.  She watches him for a bit.

          NANCY
          (interrupting him)
     What are you doing?

          DAVID
          (caught off guard)
     Why?  Nothing.

          NANCY
     Who are you talking to?

          DAVID
     I'm not talking to anybody.
     What is it?

          NANCY
     I'm leaving now.  Mr. Taft will
     be there in twenty minutes.
     Please be on time.

          DAVID
     Wait a second.  I can't do this
     today.  I can't choose tiles.
     This is my big day.  Please?
     You do it.

          NANCY
     We're trying to do this together.
     I think it's important.

          DAVID
     I'm very nervous and it's your
     kitchen anyway.  You'll make
     the right choice.

          NANCY
     You're in the kitchen more than
     I am.

          DAVID
     But I'm not thinking about
     anything when I'm in the kitchen.
     I don't really care.

          NANCY
     We said we would make these
     decisions together.

          DAVID
     Come on.  It's just today.

          NANCY
          (exasperated, turn-
          ing around and
          leaving)
     Fine.

          DAVID
     Please don't be mad.

          NANCY
     I'm not mad.

After a moment, she comes back in.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     Good luck.  You'll get it.  You
     deserve it.

Nancy exits.

          DAVID
     Thank you.  And I trust any
     decision you make.  You have
     great taste.

There's no answer.

          DAVID
          (continuing; call-
          ing after her)
     Really, you have great taste.
          (turns back around
          to the mirror)
     I'm sorry.  That was my wife...
     Yes, she has wonderful taste.
     She's going to choose the whole
     tile thing herself.  Originally,
     we were going to do it together
     but it's nice to be able to trust
     someone, don't you think?...
     Well, that's very nice.  I trust
     you, too.  Hey!... When our house
     is finished maybe you'd like to
     come over and play tennis... No,
     but we might put one in.

                                   CUT TO:


5     EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

We see David pulling into the garage.

                                   CUT TO:


6     INT. MAJOR ADVERTISING AGENCY - DAY

David is walking down the corridor towards his office.
He's saying "Hello"'s to various people.  He comes to
his own office.  There we see his secretary, SUSAN, on
the telephone.  Obviously, she's making a personal call
and she hangs up abnormally fast as soon as she sees
David.

          DAVID
     Morning.

          SUSAN
     Good morning.  Your meeting is
     in forty-five minutes.

          DAVID
     Oh my God.  What time is it now?

          SUSAN
     Ten-thirty.

          DAVID
     Okay.
          (thinking aloud)
     Ten-thirty, eleven, eleven-fifteen
     ... okay.  Susan, don't let any
     calls in.  I don't want to be
     bothered.  I don't want to do any
     business.  I just want to prepare.

David walks into his office.  After a beat, he sticks
his head out.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Oh yes. Get me Valley Mercedes,
     will you?

                                   CUT TO:


7     INT. ROBINSON'S DEPARTMENT STORE

We FOLLOW Nancy as she's walking through the department
store.  She comes to her office.  Her office is on the
third floor in the corner with the other business offi-
ces.  Her friend, PATTY, who works with her, is in the
office next door.  All offices are separated by glass
partitions.  Nancy comes in and sits down.  Patty sees
her and enters.

          PATTY
     Hi.

Nancy looks up from her desk.

          NANCY
     Hi.

          PATTY
     Is it beautiful?

          NANCY
     What?

          PATTY
     The kitchen.  What does it look
     like?

          NANCY
          (half-heartedly)
     I chose an orange tile.

          PATTY
     Orange?

          NANCY
     A burnt orange.

          PATTY
     Sounds pretty.

          NANCY
     Patty, close the door.

Patty closes the door and sits down.

          PATTY
     What's the matter?

          NANCY
     I'm going to hate this house.

          PATTY
     What are you talking about?

          NANCY
     When the contractor left this
     morning, I was all alone there
     and I sat in the middle of the
     living room and I got so sad.  I
     got this preview of the next ten
     years, I just started shaking.

Patty just stares at her.  She knows that Nancy is
serious.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     I'm so unhappy.  I don't like
     anything anymore.  I don't like
     my job.  I don't like my life.
     I don't like anything.  I feel
     dead.

          PATTY
     What do you mean?

          NANCY
     Nothing's changing.  I'm not
     growing.  David's not growing.
     We've just stopped.  Life is
     passing us by.

          PATTY
     Listen, you've had a tough week.
     With the moving and everything
     you're very tired.  When you get
     tired you feel bad.  Things seem
     worse.

          NANCY
     I'm not that tired.
     Do you know I've been hiring
     girls who are nineteen years
     old, who've already had more
     experience out of life than I
     have?

          PATTY
     You don't know that.  You
     can't tell what a person has
     experienced just by interviewing
     them.

          NANCY
     Okay.  Let's forget it.  I
     really haven't thought this
     through enough.  I don't want
     to discuss it now.  Let's get
     to work.

          PATTY
     No.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean
     to say the wrong thing.  Have
     you talked this over with
     David?

          NANCY
     Of course not.  That's the
     problem.  I can't talk anything
     over with him.  It's hopeless.

          PATTY
     Are you thinking of splitting
     up?

          NANCY
     Well, that's not my first choice
     but what's the alternative?  And
     I'm not blaming David.  I know
     he genuinely believes that being
     made Vice President is going to
     change things.  But he genuinely
     believed that every promotion
     would change things.  It never
     does.  Maybe for a few days, but
     that's it.  Then things are
     always the same.

          PATTY
     Well, this is vice president.
     Maybe this time it will change.

          NANCY
     And what if it won't?

          PATTY
     Then it won't.  Then you get
     divorced, I don't know.  Whatever
     you have to do.

          NANCY
     Oh, God.  Maybe it will.

          PATTY
     It will or it won't.

          NANCY
     Okay.  I'm starting to feel sick
     to my stomach.  Thanks for talking
     to me.  Let's just say maybe it
     will.

          PATTY
          (standing up)
     Good.  Because if it won't, it
     won't anyway so what can you do?

          NANCY
     We said we'd stop on "will."

          PATTY
     We did.  We've stopped.  It will.

Patty hesitantly backs out of Nancy's office.

          PATTY
          (continuing)
     It will.  It will work out.

Nancy stares straight ahead.  She looks very depressed.

                                   CUT TO:

8      INT. DAVID'S OFFICE

He is writing at his desk talking on the telephone.
He's writing down figures.

          DAVID
     Oh, then tax, license, out-the-
     door, everything included, what
     are we talking about?... Thirty-
     six thousand, five hundred and
     twelve.  Jesus!  For a car... No,
     I know, a Mercedes.  It's still
     a car... Well, I don't care.  To
     me, if it has wheels, it's a car.
     But that's not the point.  Now,
     that's everything, right?  That's
     it?  You don't have to pay that
     money and then be told that there
     are options?  No extras, everything
     included... Come on! - For thirty-
     seven thousand, leather is extra?
     What kind of seats are in there?...
     What is Mercedes Leather?... So,
     why don't you just say vinyl?...
     Okay, thick vinyl, but it's still
     vinyl... Okay, these kind of
     semantic arguments are silly.

The BUZZER RINGS.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Just a moment.
          (presses the
          intercom)
     Yes?

          SUSAN
     It's eleven ten.

          DAVID
     Thank you.  Susan, I have another
     one of these Mercedes guys on the
     phone, he won't hang up.  Would
     you do something with him please?

David hangs up.  He stands and walks over to a small
mirror.  He straightens his tie, fixes his jacket and
carries on one more little conversation with himself
as the boss.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     What can I say?  I guess, thank
     you... Oh, no.  I can't take your
     office.  This is too nice.
     Where would you sit?... Well, you
     are a very generous man.

He smiles and exits his office.


9     INT. OUTER OFFICE

          SUSAN
          (still on the phone)
     No!  We will call you back.
          (she hangs up)
     What a strange job to be arrogant
     in.

          DAVID
     I know.

          SUSAN
     Good luck.  Don't worry, you've
     got it.

          DAVID
     Thanks, Susan.

We FOLLOW David as he rounds the corners of this large
building on the way to Paul Dunn's office.  With each step,
he is ready to accept this new responsibility.  He stops
at his boss's secretary, MARGARET, a woman in her older
forties, a true executive type.

          MARGARET
     Well, you look very nice.

          DAVID
     Thank you and so do you, Margaret.

          MARGARET
     Go on in.

          DAVID
     Thanks.

David enters.

                                   CUT TO:


10     INT.  PAUL DUNN'S OFFICE

PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency.
He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast.
His office is large.  It smells of success.  Obviously,
this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spent
it where people can see it.  As David enters, he sees
Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman,
BRAD TOOLEY, seated on the couch. Brad Tooley is in his
early forties, very well-dressed in the upper Eastern
advertising establishment manner.  As David comes in,
Brad and Paul both get up.

          PAUL
          (his hand out-
          stretched)
     Hello, David.  How are you?

          DAVID
     I'm fine.  I'm excited.

          PAUL
     Me too.

          DAVID
     That's wonderful.

          PAUL
     David, I'd like you to meet Brad
     Tooley.

          DAVID
     Brad, it's a pleasure.

David and Brad shake hands.

          PAUL
     Brad has recently joined the agency
     in New York.  He was one of the best
     men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach.
     We were lucky to get him.

          DAVID
     Well, that's exciting.

They all sit down again.  David doesn't know quite what
to make of the fact that Brad is in this meeting.  He
just assumes this is part of the ceremony of being made
vice president.

          PAUL
     David, I don't have to tell you
     what I think of you.  You know I
     feel you're one of the most
     creative people in this company.
     I was telling Brad earlier the
     accounts you've been responsible
     for.

          BRAD
     Very impressive.  The Knudsen
     Orange Juice campaign was one of
     the best I've ever seen.  Ever.

          DAVID
          (he smiles; he's
          in his glory)
     Well, thank you.

          PAUL
     Brad has joined this company for
     a very special reason.  David,
     we're going to get Ford.

David, now thinking of himself as the vice president,
realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion,
that the profit participation could be enormous.  His
eyes widen.

          DAVID
     Oh, my God!  That's wonderful!

          PAUL
     Well, it finally puts us at the
     top of the heap.

          DAVID
     I'm stunned.  When did this happen?

          PAUL
     Just in the last few days.  You're
     really the first to know out here.
     We didn't want to say anything until
     it was final.

          DAVID
     That's wonderful.  Just wonderful.
     God, what a week.  What a week for
     all of us.

          PAUL
     It certainly is.  Now, David...

          DAVID
          (interrupts)
     Paul, you don't have to say
     anything.  As the new vice president,
     I know what this means to the
     company.  I'm here twenty-four
     hours a day.

          PAUL
     David, you're too valuable to
     become vice president.  I'd like
     you to move to New York and work
     under Brad.  You two are going
     to be in charge of Ford.  You're
     going to have to hurry, though.
     You start in three weeks.

David is not quite sure what he's just heard.  He thinks
maybe he's heard a compliment.  He's heard a name of a
city, a car, some weeks, but he hasn't put it together.
He needs to hear it again.

          DAVID
     Wait a second.  You gave me too
     much information. I'm valuable
     and I'm vice president?

          PAUL
     No, David.  I've hired Paul
     Shubano as vice president.

          DAVID
     What?

          BRAD
     He's giving you quite a compliment,
     David.  I asked him for the best
     man he had and he didn't hesitate
     for a moment.

          DAVID
     He didn't?  Well, I don't want to
     move to New York.

          PAUL
     What?

          DAVID
     I want to be the vice president.
     I want to be a stockholder in this
     company.  It was promised to me.
     I don't mind working on Ford.
     Don't get me wrong.  I think it
     would be a joy to work on but I'll
     work on it as vice president.  I've
     been here eight years, Paul.  I
     don't want to be transferred to
     just another account.

          PAUL
     This is not "just another" account,
     David.

          BRAD
     It's Ford.

          DAVID
     Brad, I know it's Ford.  I've owned
     Fords, okay?  Now, Paul, I feel it's
     only fair to keep your promise.

          PAUL
     I didn't promise you anything.

          DAVID
     Wait a minute.  What about these
     lunches that we've been having
     for the last four years?  I believe
     we talked about grooming me for
     vice president.  Phil Shubano's
     been here only three years.  Why?

          PAUL
     Well, first of all, quite frankly,
     he's not as clever as you.  He's
     more of an executive type.

          DAVID
     Oh, great.  I think that's wonderful.
     So, by being extra clever, I get
     thrown out of the town that I live
     in, with no promotion, no nothing,
     and just shifted to another account.
     He, on the other hand, because of
     his low intelligence and short time
     with the company stays here, gets
     a large amount of stock and becomes
     vice president.  Well, that makes
     sense!

          PAUL
     You keep referring to this as
     "another account."   It's not.
     It's Ford.

          DAVID
     Why don't you stop saying that?
     You sound like Dinah Shore.  Now,
     damn it, look, this isn't fair.
          (stops for a minute;
          begins to laugh)
     Paul, if I'm working myself up and
     this is a joke, I'll kill you.
     Are they going to burst in here
     and say, "Surprise!"?  Goddamnit.
     You almost had me fooled!

          PAUL
     No one's bursting in here, David.
     I'm offering you something very big.

          DAVID
     No one's bursting in here?

          PAUL
     No.

          DAVID
     No?  Oh God.  But, wait a minute,
     I'm vice president, right?

          PAUL
     No.

          DAVID
     Yes!

          PAUL
     No.

          DAVID
     Stop saying no!  Just a minute.
     I can't go to New York.  This is
     my home.  My wife and I live here.
     I just bought a four-hundred
     thousand dollar house.  I'm
     picking tile out at this very
     moment.  What am I going to do?
     Burn it down?

          PAUL
     Don't worry about that, please?
     You won't lose a penny on the house.
     We'll take care of it.  I think
     Ford is more important than a
     single family dwelling, anyway.
     We'll get you more than you paid
     for it.    The important thing is
     that you and Brad get along.

          DAVID
     Me and Brad get along?  Are you
     crazy?
     I've worked here eight years, for
     what?  For me and Brad to get
     along?  I was born in this city.
     All my friends are here.  I like
     it.  We're joking, aren't we?
     This is a joke.

          PAUL
     What do you mean, a joke?

          DAVID
     What do you mean, a joke?

          PAUL
     I didn't say a joke.

          DAVID
     I'm going to New York City?

          PAUL
     I'd like you there in three weeks.

          DAVID
     Oh, you would?

          PAUL
     This can be a stepping stone to
     something bigger, David.

          DAVID
     What's bigger than being vice
     president?  That's all I want.
     Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I've
     already stepped on every stone
     we have here, haven't I?

          PAUL
     Well, someday you might be vice
     president.

          DAVID
     Someday?  What do you mean?  It's
     today.  I've got it!

          PAUL
     You don't have it.

          DAVID
     Who has it?

          PAUL
     David, I can't say this again.
     Phil Shubano.

          DAVID
     Well, obviously, I'm blocking this
     man's name, aren't I?

          BRAD
     David, I don't know all of your
     work, but I do know you've got to
     be the best here or you wouldn't
     be working with me on this account.

          DAVID
     Brad, shut up!  Don't talk!  This
     is my day.  Paul, look what you're
     doing.  I've been with this company
     a very, very long time.  I'm one of
     the oldest employees on this coast,
     aren't I?  Now, I must get what I
     deserve.  I will be made vice
     president and I will get the stock
     and I will participate in the
     ownership of the company and that's
     that.

          PAUL
     My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.

          DAVID
     You thought I'd be thrilled?  I
     can't believe it.  Why the hell
     don't you go to New York?  If it's
     so thrilling, come on, I'll take
     you to the airport.  I'll put you
     on a plane right now.

          PAUL
     Don't talk to me like that.  I
     came from New York.

          DAVID
     Yeah, that's right and you don't
     want to go back because as soon
     as you land at the airport,
     people steal everything you've got.

          BRAD
     I resent that.  That's a cliché.
     New York's the greatest city there
     is.

          DAVID
     Sit down.  Just sit down and shut
     up.

          PAUL
     David, that's enough.

          DAVID
     No.  I haven't even started yet.
     Now listen, let's say a giant
     mistake was made.  Pretend none of
     this was ever said.  I'm the vice
     president.  Everything will be
     fine.  I'll stay here.  I'll work
     on Ford.  I'll move into my new
     house.  You and Brad can come
     over for drinks.  And now, let's
     bring out Allen Funt and everybody
     will yell, "Surprise," right?
     I'm vice president, right?

          PAUL
     David, the position is filled.

          DAVID
     Well, then you can go fuck yourself!

          BRAD
          (gets up)
     Paul, I can't work with this man.

          PAUL
     I can't either.  David, you're fired.

          DAVID
     Fired!  How dare you?  I can't believe
     this!  You want to know something?
     I was nervous about coming in here
     today.  I said to my friends, "Maybe
     I won't get this."  You know what
     everyone of them said?  "Stop it.
     You're being stupid.  You're the
     best man.  There's no one else.
     You're the best man."  And what does
     the best man do?  He stands next to
     the groom and watches the groom
     become vice president!

          PAUL
     I can see you're upset.  I'll forget
     what you said earlier.  I don't think
     you want to jeopardize eight years
     with this company.

          DAVID
     Fuck you!

          PAUL
     That's it.  Get out.

          DAVID
     I wasted my youth for you and
     for what?  What do you mean
     jeopardize eight years?  What
     eight years?  All I did was live
     for the future.  Why didn't you
     tell me a long time ago that I
     was too clever?  You should have
     told me five years ago, then I
     could've gone somewhere else.

          PAUL
     I didn't know it five years ago.

          DAVID
     Don't say anything else.  I'll
     kill you.

          PAUL
          (presses a buzzer)
     Get me security, please.

          DAVID
     Oh, I can't believe it.  Security.
     Okay, listen to me.  I want my
     eight years back!  Give me my
     life back!  I want my eight years
     back!  Give them to me!

Paul stares at him.  Brad gets up.

          BRAD
     I'm going back to the hotel.  David,
     you're making a big mistake.

          DAVID
     You don't even know me, you
     baldheaded fart!

Brad stares at him and then walks out.  He turns back to
Paul.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I can't believe that I almost
     wasted my entire life here!
     I've been waiting very, very
     patiently and I realize now what
     would've happened.  This would've
     gone on for years and years and
     years and when I was seventy, I
     would've gotten a watch.  Actually
     you wouldn't even have given me a
     watch.  You would've told me I was
     too clever, that I would instinctively
     know the time.  You know something,
     Paul?  I made fun of my friends who
     dropped out of college and went to
     "find themselves."  I told them they
     were stupid.  I laughed at them.
     And what did I do?  I went with
     you.  Good choice, wasn't it?  What
     did I get for doing that?  A transfer.
     I could've gotten that from a bus.
     You're a human bus, Jesus Christ!
     You liar!  I don't know where those
     drop-outs are today, but I've got
     to find them!  I owe them a big
     apology.  'Cause let me tell you
     something.  They have more integrity
     on their little tab of acid than
     you have in your entire body, you
     big fucking jerk!

A security guard enters.

          PAUL
          (stands up)
     Would you escort Mr. Howard out,
     please?

          DAVID
     He doesn't have to escort me out.
     I'm honored to leave.

David opens the office door.  He begins to yell so
everyone can hear him.  This is reminiscent of the
scene from "Network."

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Before I leave, I think it's very
     important for everyone in this
     company to know what went on in
     here today.
     I don't know how many lunches you've
     all had with that man and I don't
     know what he's said over salad or
     dessert or whatever he buys you,
     but you better not believe it!
     He's a real smoothie!  He'll tell
     you about the stepping stones!
     That's his favorite expression.
     He'll tell you about the stepping
     stones and where they lead.  Well,
     I found out where they lead!  To
     a baldheaded fat man in New York!
     Get out!  Get out now!  Smell the
     roses!  Smell anything!  Just smell!
     Smell before it's too late!!

The office is applauding wildly.  We HOLD on them for
a second.

                                   CUT TO:


11     BEVERLY HILLS ROBINSON'S DEPT.  STORE - DAY

David's car enters the parking lot at high speed.  The
car screeches to a halt.  He jumps out.

                                   CUT TO:


12     INT.  ROBINSON'S MAIN FLOOR

David walks hurriedly towards the elevators oblivious
to the others.

                                   CUT TO:


13     INT. J.W. ROBINSON'S - DAY

David is walking towards the personnel office.  We've
never seen him like this before.  He's alive.  He's got
more than bounce in his step.  It's as if he weighs 12
pounds.  He's on another planet.  He's smiling at every-
body.  He has the look of a "Re-born."  As he enters
the personnel department, he sees Nancy in her office.
Because Nancy's office is separated from the others by
a thin piece of glass, if you speak too loudly everyone
can hear.  David is not about to lower his voice.  He
has no concept anymore of volume.  He's just too excited.
David bursts in.

          DAVID
     Nancy!

Nancy looks up.

          NANCY
     God, you scared me.

          DAVID
     Nancy, come here.
          (he pulls her up
          by her shoulders)
     Quit.  Quit, right now.  We're
     getting out.

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     Now.  Quit.

          NANCY
     Quit?

          DAVID
     Now.  Come on. I did.  Now, you
     do it.

          NANCY
     You did? You quit your job?

          DAVID
     Surprised, aren't you?  You wouldn't
     have believed me.  You would've loved
     it.  No more me.  No more waiting.
     No more responsible David.  Jesus,
     they were leading me down a dead-end
     street!  I've been on the wrong road.
     I realize what you meant.  I've been
     too responsible.  So responsible, God!
     I've been responsibly blind!

          NANCY
     I never would've used the word
     responsible if I thought you would
     have taken it so literally.  It was
     just a word.  I really didn't mean
     anything by it.

          DAVID
     Stop.  Don't do this.  Don't.  I'm
     giving you the credit.  You did mean
     it and you were right.
     I don't know where the hell I've
     been for the last ten years.  What
     happened to me?  I lost the feeling
     of life.  Jesus, I was being jacked
     off.  Nancy, they were just jacking
     me off!

David's voice is a bit loud.  We can see people look from
other offices.

          NANCY
     Honey, shh.
          (whispering)
     A little lower, please?

          DAVID
          (whispering)
     Okay. They were jacking me off.
          (his voice starts
          to rise again)
     They were leading me down this road.
     You know, this road?

          NANCY
     What road?

          DAVID
     The road to nowhere.  You know the
     road.  The Nowhere Road.  I was
     being tugged along with this carrot.
     "Come here.  Come here.  Come here."
     But no one told me it was a fucking
     cul-de-sac!  We've been on the
     wrong road.

          NANCY
     Who was made vice president?

          DAVID
          (laughing it off)
     Oh, Nancy, that's all over now.
     That's kid's stuff.
          (in a childlike voice)
     Vice President.  Class Secretary.
     Cloakroom Monitor.  Treasurer.
     They're all stupid.
          (regular voice)
     If you really want to know who
     it was, it was Phil Shubano.

          NANCY
     No!  Why?

          DAVID
     We'll never know.  The Lord works
     in mysterious ways, but if there
     is a God, you know what will happen
     to Phil?  He'll get his profit
     sharing and he'll buy a boat with it
     and he'll crash the boat and die.

          NANCY
     Stop it.  You like Phil.  You don't
     mean that.

          DAVID
     Of course I like him, the under-
     qualified son-of-a-bitch.  Okay,
     I was harsh.  He'll crash the boat.
     He'll have a serious injury but
     he'll recover.  But forget about
     Phil!  Forget about the vice
     presidency!  That's the past.
     Nancy, it's time to do it.  We're
     still young.  We can change courses.
     We can do what we should've done
     years ago, what our smart friends
     did.  We can get out there.  We
     can get out and see this country.
     We can find out what it's about.
     We can touch Indians.  We can live
     in the mountains.  We can do
     anything we want to do.  And we're
     still young enough to really
     explore.  So come on, let's go.
     We're late.  I'll wait here.  Go
     quit.  Come on.  We're leaving.

          NANCY
     I can't just quit right now.

          DAVID
          (looking at her with
          a lust we haven't
          seen before)
     Oh, God, I want to fuck you. Come
     on.  Let's fuck, right here.

Nancy is trying, without success, not to call anymore
attention to this particular discussion.

          NANCY
          (lowered voice)
     We can do it later.  There's a
     lot of people around now.

          DAVID
     There's always going to be people
     around.  That was the problem.
     We lived for them, not for us.  It's
     okay.  There are some people you
     want to fuck in front of and some
     people you don't.  Maybe you don't
     want to fuck in front of these
     people, I don't mind.  I'll be
     outside.  You quit.  I'll wait!

          NANCY
     I can't quit now, even if I want
     to.  There is no one I can quit to.
     My boss is not here.  We'll
     talk more about it tonight, please?

          DAVID
     Okay, but we're saved.  Honey, we're
     saved.  Somebody up there likes us.
     I don't know who it is, but we're
     going to find them.  We'll find
     everybody who likes us.  We'll start
     finding people who understand what
     life is all about.  We'll find people
     who are really searching.  We'll find
     people who are willing to take a
     chance.  Look, I'll just get all
     excited and get into it all again.
     You go and finish what you have to
     do and then I'll see you tonight.

David exits.  Nancy watches him go.  She's expressionless.
She doesn't quite know what to make of this.  You can
sense that part of her thinks that maybe her prayers were
answered, maybe this is how the marriage can be saved.
You can also sense that part of her isn't sure her husband
is sane.  Maybe this won't last more than an hour and you
can sense the last part of her is still embarrassed that
the other employees she works with have heard words like
"fuck" and "jacking off."  This is a woman of many parts.

                                   CUT TO:


14     INT. THE HOWARD'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

David and Nancy are sitting on the floor.
They're surrounded by various maps, atlases and cata-
logues that show different pieces of property around
the United States, property that most people forget
even exist.  These places look amazing in their little
pictures and, in fact, they might be amazing.  It's
just that almost no one ever gets there to see them for
real.  The longer Nancy has a chance to see what her
husband is saying, the more excited she becomes.

          NANCY
          (looking in one of
          the catalogues)
     Look at this.  This is the cutest
     farmhouse I've ever seen.  Twenty-
     four acres near Darien, Connecticut,
     five bedrooms, eighty thousand
     dollars?  How could that be?

          DAVID
     Because it's there.  It's not here.
     We're used to this city.  You know
     what our new house would cost, if
     it were where this farmhouse was?
     Not four hundred thousand, maybe
     sixty thousand if we were lucky.

Nancy is still looking at pages in the catalogue.  She
stops at one picture.  She is fascinated.

          NANCY
     My God.  Look at this.  A converted
     lighthouse in Maine, fifty-five
     thousand, two bedrooms, a living
     room, a kitchen, a playroom.  How
     do you put this into a lighthouse?

          DAVID
     Well, maybe you go to Maine and
     find out.  Or you don't.  You do
     anything you want.  Nancy, look
     at this...

He opens a piece of paper, showing her the arithmetic
he has worked on all afternoon.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     This seems to make sense to me.
     You tell me what you think.
     The one good thing about spending
     all this time in Los Angeles was
     that we got a free ride on this
     bullshit inflation train.  Don't
     ask me how it happened, but we made
     a hundred and ninety thousand dollar
     profit by staying in this house
     for less than five years.  Now,
     that was money we were never going
     to see 'cause we were about to put
     it back into another stupid house.
     Okay.  We pull out of that house,
     we lose our fifteen thousand dollars
     in Escrow, we take the money from
     this house, we liquidate everything
     else we have, cars, stocks, bonds,
     everything... Nancy, we have two
     hundred thousand dollars!

          NANCY
     We couldn't.

          DAVID
     We do.

David shows her the figures.  As Nancy looks at the piece
of paper, he continues:

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     All we need to buy is a motor
     home and we should get a great
     one because we might live there
     for the rest of our lives, or
     for five years or ten years or
     whatever.

          NANCY
     What do you think a motor home
     costs?

          DAVID
     Guess who went motor home shopping?
     We can get a great one for twenty-
     five thousand dollars.  If there's
     one thing you can get a deal on
     it's a motor home.  This is the best
     time in history to drop out.  It's
     a buyer's market!

          NANCY
     So that would leave us a hundred
     and seventy-five thousand dollars.
     I can't believe it!

          DAVID
     Yes!  On that kind of money we
     could ramble across the country
     for years!  We can paint, we can
     explore, we can meet amazing
     people.

          NANCY
     And if we get to Connecticut and
     we like one of these farmhouses,
     we'd have enough money to put a
     down payment on it, wouldn't we?

          DAVID
     Yes!  Then if we get sick of that
     we could sell it and move on.

          NANCY
     I'd like to go to Alaska.

          DAVID
     Great!  Alaska's great!  We can
     do anything we want.

          NANCY
     This is what we talked about when
     we were nineteen!

          DAVID
     Yes.  We talked about finding
     ourselves but we laughed it off
     because we had no money. Now
     we can do it in comfort. We've
     got our nest egg.  This is a
     dream come true.

Nancy has a tear in her eye. David sees it.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     What's wrong?  Are you okay?

          NANCY
     We really can do whatever we
     want to, can't we?

          DAVID
     Who's stopping us?

Nancy stares.  She thinks about that question.  She
can't come up with an answer.  Finally, almost in
tears.

          NANCY
     Nobody's stopping us!

                                   CUT TO:


15     INT. PETE HIRSCH'S HOME - NIGHT

PETE HIRSCH is one of David's former associates at the
agency.  He and his wife are throwing a party for
David and Nancy, a final farewell gathering.  There are
people milling about, talking, general good cheer.
David and Nancy are the heroes of the evening.  In the
corner of the room is a huge cake.  The CAMERA MOVES
ABOUT, PICKING UP various bits of conversation.

          PATTY
     You look very happy.  You look
     so good.  I'm happy for you.

          NANCY
     I know you are.

She gives Patty a hug.  An older, dignified-looking man,
JACK MARTIN and his wife, CAROL, approach Nancy.  Obvi-
ously, he's an executive at Robinson's.

          JACK MARTIN
     Well, well.

          NANCY
     I didn't know you were going to
     come.

          JACK MARTIN
          (he gives her a
          paternal hug)
     One employee we are certainly
     going to miss.

          CAROL
          (to Nancy)
     I think it sounds wonderful.

                                   CUT TO:

16     INT. OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

A group of men are gathered around David.  One of
David's friends at work, JIM, is speaking:

          JIM
     You were great.  Man, it was great.
     It was like "Network" and "Take
     This Job and Shove It," all rolled
     into one.  When you left, we all
     wanted to go with you.  Really.
     People really had to think for a
     minute.   They were ready to leave.

          DAVID
     Did anyone else leave?

          JIM
     No.  I mean after a few minutes,
     people just went back to work,
     but for the moment, it was real
     exciting.

          DAVID
     Well, when the time's right, if
     people want to leave, they will.

          JIM
     Of course.  I believe that. I
     got to be honest with you, though.
     I was thinking about my situation
     and I don't think I have the guts.

          DAVID
     I don't know that it's guts.  It
     just takes a certain kind of person.

          JIM
     Yeah, maybe it has nothing to do
     with guts.  'Cause I think I have
     guts.  I guess I'm not that kind
     of person. Let's say that I like
     expensive things and I guess I
     need my job to get what I like.

          DAVID
     Whatever makes you happy.

          JIM
     Right.  I guess expensive things
     make me happy.  These shoes make
     me happy.  Do you like them?

He shows David his shoes.  They look very expensive.
For a moment, David forgets he will no longer partic-
ipate in this world.

          DAVID
     Beauties.  What are they?  Bally's?

          JIM
     A Bally copy.  Bally's would be
     three hundred bucks.  These were
     a hundred and eighty.  Can't tell
     the difference.  The sole's just
     as thick.  Look, feel the sole.

          DAVID
          (starts to touch the
          bottom of his shoe
          and then stops)
     No, I don't know where you've been,
     Jim.  I don't want to touch your
     shoe.  They're beautiful.  Good
     thick sole.

Nancy calls across the room to David.

          NANCY
     Honey?

David walks over and recognizes one of her bosses, Jack
Martin.

          DAVID
     Hello, Jack.  How are you?

          JACK
     Daniel Boone, as I live and
     breathe.  Dan, you know my wife,
     Carol.

          DAVID
          (shakes hands)
          Hi, Carol.

          JACK
     So, Mr. Boone, you leave in the
     morning, uh?

          DAVID
     Let's call me David from now on.
     Just for old times sake.

          JACK
     Oh, come on, I'm just playing with
     you.  Listen, I'll tell you
     something.  What you and your
     wife are doing, well, it's wonderful.
     Carol and I were driving over here
     tonight, and talking seriously
     about breaking the mold ourselves.

          DAVID
     Really?

          JACK
     You bet.  We haven't been that
     happy lately.  Have we, honey?

How can a person respond to this?  Carol just stares
at him.

          JACK
          (continuing)
     I told her, if I can get some time
     off, we're going to try to get down
     to La Costa for a weekend and just
     let it all out.

David now realizes that breaking the "mold" has many
different meanings to different people.

          DAVID
     La Costa?  For a whole weekend,
     huh?  That's great.

          JACK
     That's if I can get away.  If not,
     at least for an afternoon.  Just
     the idea of getting to San Diego,
     maybe take in Sea World.  Anyway,
     did Nancy tell you what Robinson's
     plans to do?

          DAVID
     Actually we haven't talked too much
     about American business lately.

          JACK
     Well, there is a rumor and I would
     appreciate you not telling anyone
     this, but our store may just be
     buying up the May Company.  This is
     just the kind of expansion that can
     make a man like me very, very
     wealthy.

          DAVID
     Well, if it's good for you, I'm
     real happy.

          JACK
     Well, let's just say it could make
     me a million dollars, minimum.  But,
     David, please keep this down.  God,
     I probably shouldn't have said
     anything.

          DAVID
     Jack, we're not going to be around
     people who will care.  I promise
     you.  I don't think a guide at
     the Grand Canyon knows or cares
     too much about the acquisition of
     a department store in L.A.

          JACK
     You want a surprise?  You want to
     know about the Grand Canyon and
     business?  The 7-Eleven at the
     Grand Canyon does more volume
     business per year than any other
     7-Eleven in the country, especially
     around Muscular Dystrophy time.

          DAVID
     Well, that's good to know.

          JACK
     I think it has something to do
     with the hiking and the tragedy
     of the children who can't hike.
     I don't know, but last year they
     did two million, eight-hundred
     thousand.  Now, of course, there
     are no other quickie stores around
     so they have a good one there.  A
     lot of people moving in and out
     of that canyon.  Have you seen
     these new U-Tote-M stores?

          DAVID
     Jack, I don't want to be rude but
     I can't talk business anymore.  I
     hate to sound "sixties" to you
     but I'm in a different place.

          JACK
     Hey, I understand.  I remember
     the sixties.
     As a matter of fact, the concept
     of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept.
     See, the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush
     place.  U-Tote-M is lay-back.  Their
     store in Tarzana this year is
     going to gross almost...

          DAVID
          (interrupts)
     Jack, please?

Pete Hirsch yells from across the room.

          PETE
     I'd like to make a toast.

People mumble, "Great."  "Good."  "It's about time."
Everybody gathers around.  People raise their glasses
up.

          PETE
          (continuing)
     To our beautiful friends, David
     and Nancy Howard... Good luck!

He drinks.

          DAVID
     That's it, huh?  What a well thought
     out toast.  Thank you, Pete.

People laugh.  Scattered laughter around the room.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Well, I think it's time for me
     to say something right now.

We hear a little applause.  "Speech!  Speech!"

          DAVID
          (continuing; calling
          Nancy over)
     Sweetheart, would you come here?

David and Nancy stand together, arm-in-arm.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I have a surprise for my wife and
     I would like to share it, not only
     with her, but with you, who we
     consider our closest friends.  We
     do have some other close friends.
     I'm sure they got lost.

People laugh.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     When Nancy and I were married we
     had dreams and plans and I guess
     in the pursuit of those things,
     we kind of lost each other.
     Tomorrow morning, when we leave
     here, we have no destination.
     Our only goal is to find out who
     we really are and what it is that's
     really out there.  We're going to
     be adventurers in the classic sense
     of the word, but there is one place
     that we will stop at first.
          (reaches into his
          pocket and takes
          out a little box)
     That place is Las Vegas, Nevada.

          NANCY
          (her eyes open up
          wide; excited)
     Las Vegas?  Really?

          DAVID
     Well, if this is to be a new
     beginning, I think there's only
     one way to really show it to this
     woman that I love.  So, tomorrow
     evening my wife and I are going
     to be remarried.

People applaud.  Nancy is overwhelmed.  She opens the
little box and there is a ruby ring.

          NANCY
     Oh, my God!  Oh!  My!

People are trying to get a glance at the ring.  We can
hear OOHING and AAHING.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     This is the most beautiful thing
     you've ever done.

          DAVID
     Well, I'd like to say it was
     nothing, but that small little
     ruby cost a fortune.

People laugh.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     That's okay, it's budgeted for.

A little laughter again.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     And now, I would like to propose
     a toast.

Everyone raises their glasses.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     To you, our loyal friends, we will
     miss you.  To my lovely new bride,
     I want to know you all over again...
     And to America, get ready.  Here
     we come!

Everybody drinks.  As they do we...

                                   CUT TO:


17     EXT. SAN BERNARDINO FREEWAY - NEXT DAY

We hear MUSIC (possibly the song from "Easy Rider" when
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda left L.A. on their motor-
cycles).  This is the first time we see the motor home.
No expense was spared on this.  It's seventy feet long.
From the outside, you can see a roof that doubles as a
little patio where you can sun yourself.  The windows
are huge.  It looks luxurious, even from a distance.

                                   CUT TO:


18     INT. MOTOR HOME

David is driving.  Nancy is in the back in the kitchen
area.

          DAVID
     Honey, we're two minutes from
     crossing the city limits.  Come
     up front.  This is historic.

          NANCY
          (from the rear
          of the trailer)
     Just a second!  This microwave
     oven browns, did you know that?
     The one in our new house couldn't
     even do that.

          DAVID
     Our new house?  No, some poor
     sucker's new house.  This is our
     new house and I love it.

Nancy walks up towards the front with two melted cheese
sandwiches.  No matter how horrible the sandwiches looked
or tasted, to David, it would be great.  That's his new
attitude.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Boy, does this smell good.  How
     long did it take to melt this?

          NANCY
     Twenty seconds.

          DAVID
     Can you believe it?  Boy!  I
     never really tasted melted cheese
     on toast before.  I must have
     eaten it a million times, but
     this is the first time I've really
     tasted it. It's good and I bet
     it gets better the further we
     get from L.A.

          NANCY
     We'll actually be breathing clean
     air.  We haven't done that for --
     how many years?

          DAVID
     Forever. I hope we can recognize
     it.

Nancy smiles.  This is certainly the best mood she's
been in for a long time.

          NANCY
     Last night was so nice, don't you
     think?  Those are good people.
     We had good friends there.

          DAVID
     I know.  It's just that we weren't
     good friends there.

          NANCY
     Every once in a while I can't
     believe what we're doing.  Are
     you scared?  Be honest.

          DAVID
     No, not at all.   Well, let's say
     I'm scared in the same way
     Columbus was scared.

          NANCY
     Columbus must have really been
     scared, huh?  That took a lot
     of guts, didn't it?  What if
     the world was flat?  They really
     didn't know anything.

          DAVID
     Well, I think he covered himself.

          NANCY
     How?

          DAVID
     Oh, let's say there was the Pinta,
     the Nina and the Santa Maria.  I'd
     bet everything I have that Columbus
     was in the Santa Maria.  If the
     world was flat, I think he'd watch
     the Pinta and the Nina go.  Then
     he'd tell the Santa Maria to turn
     around.  He'd probably just go back
     and have sex with the Queen again.
     I don't think he was a complete
     schmuck.

          NANCY
     So, actually, we're braver than
     Columbus.  We don't have two motor
     homes in front of us.

          DAVID
     That's right.  However, we should
     keep our eye on that Buick ahead.
     If it falls off the earth, it
     would be wise to pull over and re-
     evaluate.

19     EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT TIME

The town is all lit up.  The motor home pulls up in
front of a 24-hour wedding chapel.  David stops.  He
stares at the chapel through the window.


20     INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

          DAVID
     Doesn't it look beautiful?  I'm
     excited.
          (opens the door
          and starts to get out)
     Let me find out what we do. I'll
     get all the information.

          NANCY
     Wait a second.

          DAVID
     What?

          NANCY
     Aren't you tired?

          DAVID
     I'm excited.

          NANCY
     You know what we should do?  We
     should get married tomorrow.

          DAVID
     Why?  We should get married now
     and then drive out to the Grand
     Canyon and have our second
     honeymoon under the stars.  What
     could be better than that?

          NANCY
     Well, here's what I'd like to do.
     I'd like to get married in the
     morning.  We're trying to start
     a new life.  We should do it at
     the beginning of a new day.  We'll
     both be fresh.  We'll be up.  We
     can get married at the crack of
     dawn.

          DAVID
     That sounds nice.  Alright.  We'll
     camp out some place tonight and
     then come back before dawn.  As
     a matter-of-fact, these places will
     be less crowded then.  Good idea.
     Nancy, you're a genius.

He starts the engine.

          NANCY
     Are we sure we want to camp out
     tonight?

          DAVID
     What?

          NANCY
     Why don't we make tonight a real
     old-fashioned honeymoon?  Let's
     go to the best hotel and get
     the honeymoon suite and celebrate
     our heads off.

          DAVID
     Sweetheart, we don't want to stay
     in a Vegas hotel.  This is what
     we've left, this money-grabbing,
     horrible society.

          NANCY
     I agree, but one night?  We'll
     have room service and make love
     in a big bed and watch porno
     movies.  I think it'll be fun.

          DAVID
     We want to touch Indians.

          NANCY
     We will.  Just tonight and then
     that's it.
          Don't you want to take a bath
     together in one of those big
     tubs?

          DAVID
     Well, okay.

          NANCY
     If you really don't want to, we
     don't have to.  We can camp out.

          DAVID
     No, it's okay.  As a matter-of-fact,
     it might be very exciting.  We
     haven't been in a bath together
     for a long time.

                                   CUT TO:


21     EXT.  DESERT  INN - NIGHT

David pulls the motor home into the parking lot and
turns over the keys to the young parking attendant.


22     INT.  LOBBY OF DESERT INN

David and Nancy are coming through the main doors.
We can see the motor home being driven out of the drive-
way by one of the valet parking attendants. David
looks behind him and watches the home drive off.  He's
nervous.

          DAVID
     I don't think they know how to
     drive those things.  He could
     ruin it.

          NANCY
          (all excited)
     Oh, don't worry.  They can drive
     anything.  Look. Isn't this
     wonderful?  It's so romantic.
     God, I used to come here a lot.
     I kind of miss it.

          DAVID
     You never told me you came here.
     When?

          NANCY
     Before we were married.  I'll
     tell you about it later.  Come
     on.

They approach the front desk.  A CLERK is working at
one of the reservation computers.

          CLERK
     Excuse me?

          DAVID
     My wife and I have dropped out of
     society and we're making this
     statement, but we want to spend
     one last night here.  We're
     planning to get up at the crack
     of dawn and get remarried and...

          NANCY
          (interrupting David,
          she whispers to him)
     Just ask him for the room.

          DAVID
          (whispering back)
     I'm getting to it.  I know what
     I'm doing.
          (to the Clerk)
     Anyway, we're going to get up
     very early and get remarried
     so we want something very special
     because we're doing something
     special.  My point is, we'd
     like your finest bridal suite.

          CLERK
     Do you have a reservation?

          DAVID
     No, I told you, we just dropped
     out.  We don't do reservation
     things anymore.  We're living
     spontaneously.

          CLERK
     Well, we're not.  We thrive on
     reservations and I'm sorry but
     the bridal suite is occupied.

          DAVID
     What other rooms do you have?

          NANCY
          (to the Clerk)
     Just a minute, please?
          (she pulls David
          aside, whispering)
     The bridal suite isn't occupied.

          DAVID
     What?

          NANCY
     It's not occupied. I can see it
     in his face.

          DAVID
     What do you mean?

          NANCY
     Give him money.

          DAVID
     What?

          NANCY
     Give him fifty bucks.

          DAVID
     Why?

          NANCY
     We'll get the bridal suite.

          DAVID
     How do you know?

          NANCY
     Trust me.

David approaches the desk again.  He takes out fifty
dollars.  He puts it in the Clerk's hand, like he's
shaking hands with him.

          DAVID
     Hello, again.
          (slips him the
          fifty)
     Do me a favor?  I've worked with
     computers.  I know what can happen.
     Sometimes these things get fouled
     up.  Would you check one more
     time?
     Maybe the bridal suite was empty
     and the room next to it was occupied
     and the computer got mixed up.

          CLERK
          (takes a look)
     I know what you mean.  That can
     happen sometimes.  Let me check.
          (he looks at the
          reservation com-
          puter for a moment)
     Nope.  It's occupied.  These are
     state-of-the-art computers.  Very
     rarely do we have those kind of
     mistakes.

          DAVID
     You're sure?

          CLERK
     Yes. Says right here, "Bridal
     Suite full."

Nancy leans over and whispers to David.

          NANCY
     Give him more.

               DAVID
     Jesus.  Really?

Nancy nods yes.  David turns back to the Clerk.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Listen, I'm not very good at this.
     I don't get good seats in shows
     because of this problem.  I don't
     get good tables in restaurants.
     I've really never been good at
     this particular kind of exchange
     of money so, how much do you
     want?

          CLERK
     A hundred dollars.

          DAVID
     Fine.
          (hands him more cash)
     Here you go.  A hundred.
     Now, I assume we don't have to
     continue this computer talk
     again and say that it's working
     now and everything?

The Clerk doesn't even bother to answer.  He reaches
behind the desk and hands David his key.

          CLERK
     Here you are, eight-twenty.

He rings for the porter.

          DAVID
     Now, this is the best bridal
     suite?

          CLERK
     Heart-shaped bed.  Everything.
     You'll love it.

          DAVID
     Thank you very much.  I'm sure
     the hundred doesn't apply towards
     the room at all.

          CLERK
     You're kidding, right?

          DAVID
     Of course.  I was kidding all
     along.

David and Nancy leave the desk and walk towards the
elevator.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Tell me we didn't do the right
     thing, getting out of this horrible
     society?  Jesus Christ, I told the
     guy we dropped out. Did that make
     any difference?  No. I said we're
     making a statement.  What did he do?
     Stare at me.  I said we're getting
     remarried.  What does he finally
     say?  Give me more money.  God!
     How does a guy like that even live?

          NANCY
     Well, think of all the people
     checking in here.  Everyone giving
     him a hundred dollars, he probably
     lives well.

          DAVID
     No, I meant with himself.  How
     does he... Never mind.

                                   CUT TO:


23     INT. BEDROOM SUITE - DESERT INN

David and Nancy enter.  Apparently, the hundred
dollars was not quite enough.  This could not be
Desert Inn's best bridal suite.  This looks like the
junior bridal suite, at best.  At one end of the room
are two twin heart-shaped beds.  Above them, there's a
mirror, heavily-flocked with gold specks.  The rest of
the room is decorated in standard red velour.  Nancy is
disappointed.  David is confused.  He can't figure out
how any manufacturer could make a living turning out
twin heart-shaped beds.

          PORTER
     I'll go down and get your luggage
     for you.  Where is it?

          DAVID
     That's okay.  It's locked in our
     house.  I'll get it later.  Thank
     you very much.

David reaches into his pocket and gives the man a dollar.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I haven't been here in years.  I
     hope this is enough.  If it isn't,
     take some from the clerk.  I gave
     him a hundred.

The Porter looks at David and walks out without saying
a word.

          NANCY
     So?  What do you think?

          DAVID
     I think if Liberace had children,
     this would be their room.  Cute
     little hearts, aren't they?

          NANCY
     We should ask for a bigger bed.

          DAVID
     Let's hold onto the cash we have.
     I don't want any more favors.
     We can try and push these together.

They try but they find very quickly that hearts don't
fit together.  After a few attempts, they give up.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Look, we can crawl over the
     ventricles when we want to have
     sex.  It'll be exciting.  Why
     don't you order something up,
     okay?  Order up a great meal and
     some great champagne.  I'll go
     run the bath.

David walks into the bathroom.  Nancy sits down on the
bed.  She picks up the room service menu and starts to
read through it.  She calls to David.

          NANCY
     How's the bath?

          DAVID
          (walking out of
          the bathroom)
     There's no bath in there, honey.

          NANCY
     Come on.

          DAVID
     I have no reason to lie to you.
     Go look for yourself.  There's a
     very teeny, heart-shaped
     shower and a medium sized, heart-
     shaped sink.  At best, we can
     wash our socks together.

          NANCY
     Are you disappointed?

          DAVID
     Not at all.

          NANCY
     Maybe we shouldn't order room
     service.  We should get dressed
     and go down and check out some
     of these restaurants.  Hey, do
     you want to see a show?

          DAVID
     I don't want to leave the room.
     I just want to be with you tonight,
     here.  It's our honeymoon.  We
     should order up like we planned
     and then we can figure out a way
     to make love.  Somewhere in this
     room, there has to be space.

          NANCY
     Okay.
          (gets up and walks
          toward the bath-
          room)
     I'm going in to take a nice hot
     shower, okay?

          DAVID
     Good.  You get nice and sexy
     because when you come out, we'll
     pack and leave.

          NANCY
     Come on.  We're going to have fun.

          DAVID
     I'm joking with you.  Now, hurry
     up, I'm getting horny.  When you
     come out, I'll be the naked one
     on the right heart.  I might even
     be looking at myself in the mirror
     and masturbating.  Although, I
     don't think I can see myself
     through all this gold flock.

24      SHOT OF ALARM CLOCK

It's ringing.  The time is five-thirty A.M.  As we
PULL BACK we see David reaching over and shutting it
off.  He rolls over towards the other heart bed.

          DAVID
     Rise and shine, my darling wife.
          (singing to the
          tune of "My Fair
          Lady")
     We're getting married this morning.
     We're...

He stops singing.  She doesn't seem to be in the other
bed.  The room's still a little dark.  Maybe David isn't
seeing clearly yet.  He's patting all over the bed.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Nancy?  Honey?

He realizes she's not there.  He gets up and walks
towards the bathroom.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Honey?  Are you in there?  Nancy?

There's no answer.  Obviously, she's not in the bathroom.
Possibly, she's gone down the hall to get ice.  He opens
the door and calls down the hall.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Honey?  Nancy?  Are you at the
     ice machine?

He goes back into the room.  He picks up the phone.  A
WOMAN'S VOICE answers.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
     May I help you?

          DAVID
     Yes.  I'd like to page Nancy
     Howard, please.

          WOMAN'S VOICE
     And where would she be?  Do you
     have any idea?

          DAVID
     Probably in the coffee shop.

David sits and waits.  After a short pause:

          MAN'S VOICE
     Hello?

          DAVID
     Hi, honey.  Had a sex change, huh?
          (laughs at his joke)
     I think you picked up the wrong
     phone.  I'm paging my wife.

          MAN
     You're married to Nancy Howard?

          DAVID
     Yes.

          MAN
     Why don't you come down to the
     casino?

          DAVID
     Why?  Is there something wrong?

          MAN
     Your wife has been gambling for
     quite some time and possibly, you
     should speak with her.

          DAVID
     What do I have to say to her?  Is
     she winning?

          MAN
     Why don't you just come downstairs?

          DAVID
          (hangs up the
          phone)

25     INT. DESERT INN CASINO

David comes tearing into the casino.  He is still in
his bathrobe.  A SECURITY GUARD stops him.

          GUARD
     I'm sorry, you can't come into
     the casino dressed like that.

          DAVID
     What are you, crazy?  I saw
     Electric Horseman.  Animals rode
     through here.  Excuse me.

He pushes past the Guard.  He looks frantically around
trying to find Nancy.  At this hour of the morning, it's
easy to spot people.  There aren't too many of them.
He sees her.  She's off in the corner at the roulette
table.  There's a small group of people around her.  They
seem to be watching, she seems to be gambling.  David
walks as fast as he can.  He doesn't want to run, his
robe might open up.  As he approaches Nancy, he is
frightened by what he sees.  She is a maniac.  She has
been up for hours.  The transformation is scary.  It's
like Jekyll and Hyde.  She's frantically moving chips all
around the table.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Honey?  What are you doing?

          NANCY
          (to the Dealer)
     Eight!  Big chips!

          DAVID
     Honey?

          NANCY
     Not now.  Get away.  Not now.

          DAVID
     What's going on?

          NANCY
     Stop it.  Come on, eight!  Come
     on, eight!

The DEALER spins the wheel.  The ball drops into the
number sixteen slot.

          DEALER
     Sixteen.

          NANCY
          (shrieks)
     Shit!

          DAVID
     Honey, calm down. Sweetheart?

The Man who spoke to David on the telephone approaches
him at the table.

          MAN
     Could I speak to you for a moment?

          DAVID
     What is it?

The Man takes David aside.

          MAN
     Your wife is very distraught.
     She's been gambling almost
     five hours and she has not been
     on a lucky streak.  Now, it's
     not our place to stop her, but
     possibly, you should.

          DAVID
     What do you mean she's not been
     on a lucky streak?  She's losing?

          MAN
     Well, why don't you talk to her?

David runs back to the table.

          DAVID
     Honey, I want to talk to you.

          NANCY
     Get away!
          (to the Dealer)
     Once again!  Give me eight!

The Dealer spins the wheel.  The ball goes around and
around.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     Come on, baby.  Come on, lucky
     baby.  Baby, baby.  Baby, baby.

          DEALER
     Eight it is.

          NANCY
          (jumping up,
          excited as
          can be)
     Yes!  Great!

          DAVID
          (now a little
          excited himself)
     Hey, that is great.  You're a
     winner.
          (to Dealer)
     How much was that?  How much did
     she win?

          DEALER
     Sixty dollars.

          DAVID
     Alright.  Nothing wrong with that.
     What's wrong with that?  Now, what
     does this man mean who says you
     weren't on a lucky streak?

          NANCY
     I was down earlier.  Just go away.

          DAVID
     But you're up now, right?

          NANCY
     I'm still down.
          (to Dealer)
     Eight again!  And make it happen
     for me!

David turns to the Man who spoke to him on the phone.
The Man is standing at a distance watching what's
happening with a slight look of pity on his face.

          DAVID
          (walking over to him)
     Boy, she keeps betting eight, huh?
     How down is she exactly?

          MAN
     Oh, she's very, very down.  I
     don't know how much money you
     have, but on the average I'd
     say this is what we call "very
     down."

          DAVID
     What do you mean?  A thousand?

At this moment, we hear a GROAN from the roulette table.
The ball has dropped into double zero.  David runs back
over.  He sees the Dealer taking the chips off of eight.

          NANCY
     Dammit!  That keeps coming up,
     that zero.  Jesus Christ!
     Now, once again, eight!  Come back,
     eight!  Come back, eight!

          DAVID
     Just a minute.  Nancy, stop.

          NANCY
     Please, David!  Please!  You're
     bringing me bad luck.

          DAVID
     Well, according to some people here,
     I'm not bringing anything.  You're
     already having bad luck.

          NANCY
     It's changing!  Now come on,
     eight!  Eight's my mate!  Take
     the bait, number eight.

The Dealer spins the ball.  It drops into the number four.

          DEALER
     Four.

          NANCY
     See what you did?  Bad luck!  Get
     away, please.

          DAVID
     This man over here says you're
     very down.  What does he mean?

          NANCY
     Fuck the man!  I don't know who
     you're talking about.
          (to Dealer)
     Try it again!  Eight!

          DAVID
     Nancy, stop betting eight.  There's
     hundreds of numbers on this table.
     Why the hell do you keep betting
     eight?  Now, how much have we lost?

          NANCY
     Everything.  Come on, eight.

          DAVID
     What do you mean everything?  Did
     you say everything?

At this moment, the ball falls into number nine.  The
Dealer takes the last of Nancy's chips.

          NANCY
     Goddammit!  Son-of-a-bitch!  You
     can't get any closer to eight
     than nine.

          DAVID
          (beginning to
          take charge)
     Come over here. Come with me.

He drags Nancy away from the roulette table. She turns
around.   She's yelling at the Dealer.

          NANCY
     Eight again!  One more time!

          DAVID
     There's nothing on the board.
     You're not at the table.  You
     haven't placed a bet.  Stop
     yelling eight.   He doesn't care
     anymore.

          NANCY
     I gotta find some money. Please.
     I'm about to hit.

          DAVID
     No, you're about to get hit.   Come
     on.  We have some serious talking
     to do.

David starts to pull Nancy out of the casino.  He passes
by a one-dollar progressive slot machine with Nancy in
tow as BELLS START TO RING and LIGHTS FLASH.   An OLDER
WOMAN has hit the jackpot and starts to scream.

          WOMAN
     I won!!  I won!!

          NANCY
     Look.  She won... I want to play!

          DAVID
     It's too late.  You chose the table.
     Let's get out of here.

                                   CUT TO:


26     INT. COFFEE SHOP

They sit down at one of the tables.  David looks a
little worried.  Nancy is still frantic.  She's mixed
up.  She's also looking around for a Keno girl.  She's
obviously in some sort of a daze.

          DAVID
     Okay, talk.  What's going on?

          NANCY
     At two-thirty this morning, I was
     up three hundred thousand dollars.

          DAVID
     Three hundred thousand dollars?
     That's a lot of money!

          NANCY
     More chips than you've ever seen
     in your life.  You wouldn't have
     believed it.  They were all over
     the place.

          DAVID
     But when I came downstairs they
     were all gone.  You didn't have any.

          NANCY
     Yes, but I can get them back.

          DAVID
     Let's wait on that for just a
     second.  So, everything is gone
     and I'm trying to figure out the
     word "everything."  We had a
     little bit of cash with us and
     you lost that?

          NANCY
     Yes.

          DAVID
     So, what did you do?  You got
     more cash?

          NANCY
     Yes.

          DAVID
     So, you wrote a check then?

          NANCY
     Yes.

          DAVID
     You started drawing cash from our
     nest egg?

          NANCY
     Yes.  Yes.

          DAVID
     How much of the nest egg did
     you take?  What's left?

          NANCY
     Nothing.

          DAVID
     Oh, my God. By "everything" you
     mean "nothing."

          NANCY
     Yes.

          DAVID
     You didn't lose a hundred and
     eighty thousand dollars?

          NANCY
     Maybe.  I don't know.  Give or
     take a thousand.

          DAVID
     Give or take a thousand?  Give
     or take a thousand?

David is holding on to one of his testicles so as not
to kill this woman.  This is the first time in his life,
where he truly can't comprehend what he has heard.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Oh my God!  Oh my God! I understand
     what we mean now.  I understand what
     we all mean.  Oh my God!  My God!
     My God!

David puts his hand to his forehead. He looks around.
He's thinking.  Something must be done. Something must
be done quickly.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Oh my God!  Alright.  Let's not
     panic.

David thinks of something.  He stands up from the
table and yells as loud as he can.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Bellhop, please.  Bellhop, in here,
     please.  There's an emergency!

He sits down, he's rubbing his head.

          NANCY
     What's the matter?

          DAVID
     Nothing.  Just wait.  Oh my God!

          NANCY
     Sweetheart, there were these
     Persians around me, staring at
     all these chips that were on
     the table and I've never had
     that feeling before, the feeling
     that I was completely in control.
     I was the one.  I didn't need
     anything.  I didn't care.  I
     didn't have any problems.  Do
     you know that feeling?

          DAVID
     Not now. I don't know that feeling
     now, no.

The BELLHOP approaches.

          BELLHOP
     Yes, sir?

          DAVID
     First of all, I was speaking to a
     gentleman in the casino who seemed
     to be in charge there.  He's what?

          BELLHOP
     The Pit Boss?

          DAVID
     Yes.  What's his name?

          BELLHOP
     Mr. Shuster.

          DAVID
     Fine.  Does he have an office?

          BELLHOP
     Yes, it's behind the front desk.

          DAVID
     Fine.  Alright.  Now would you
     please do me a favor?  My wife
     is tired and would you escort
     her to 820.
          (hands the Bellhop
          his room key)
     Would you please sit with her,
     maybe she'll want to take a shower
     or whatever, and just don't leave
     the room.  I'll be up in a little
     while.  But please don't leave.
     I don't want her to be alone right
     now.

          NANCY
     Why are you treating me like an
     animal?

          DAVID
     I'll explain it to you later.

They all get up.  They exit the coffee shop.


27     INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE COFFEE SHOP

          DAVID
          (speaking to Nancy as
          if she has just had
          a nervous breakdown)
     Just relax.  Lie down, if you want.
     Have some water.  I'll be up in a
     few minutes.

          NANCY
     Stop talking to me this way.

          DAVID
     I'm not talking to you in any
     particular way.  I'm just trying
     to keep everything calm and I'm
     trying to remain calm.  I'm also
     trying to think what I can do to
     help us out now.
          (to the Bellhop)
     The man's name again?  The Pit Boss?

          BELLHOP
     Shuster.

          DAVID
     Thank you.

They are now at the elevators.

          NANCY
     David, I'm sorry.

          DAVID
     Save it.  Just go upstairs.

He leaves her at the elevators.


28      INT. LOBBY

David walks very slowly towards Shuster's office.  You
can tell he's thinking.  He approaches the front desk
and clears his throat, trying to act dignified.  The robe
diminishes this a bit.

          DAVID
          (to the Clerk)
     Mr. Shuster, the Pit Boss, may I
     speak to him, please?

          CLERK
     I don't know if he's in.  Just a
     moment.

The Clerk picks up the phone.  He buzzes.

          CLERK
          (continuing)
     Yes.  There's a gentleman here
     to see you.
          (to David)
     What is your name?

          DAVID
     I'm David Howard.  He knows me,
     we spoke on the telephone.  My
     wife was the one who was up for
     hours.

          CLERK
          (into phone)
     David Howard.  Yes.  Yes.
          (hangs up phone)
     He'll be right out.

David stands there.  He's thinking, staring straight
ahead.  Out of an office emerges JACK SHUSTER, the Pit
Boss, the man we saw earlier.  Shuster's a large man,
in his early fifties.  He's as intimidating as his
job calls for.  He looks like he might have killed
somebody once, and actually enjoyed it.  He walks
over to David.

          SHUSTER
     Mr. Howard?  Come on in.

                                   CUT TO:


29      INT. SHUSTER'S OFFICE

David tries to compose himself even more as he follows
Shuster into his office.  David's story is now formed.
He knows what he wants to say.  He feels confident.
David enters the office.  He sits down in front of
Shuster's desk.

          DAVID
     First of all, let me say, I've
     heard a great deal about you.

          SHUSTER
          (suspicious)
     What do you mean?  From who?
     What did you hear?

          DAVID
     Oh, I just meant I've heard
     wonderful things from everybody
     in general, from the whole hotel.

          SHUSTER
          (relieved)
     Well, that's very nice.  Thank
     you.

          DAVID
     No, thank you.

          SHUSTER
     Is your wife feeling better?

          DAVID
     Yes, she is.

          SHUSTER
     So, what can I do for you?

          DAVID
     I have a very interesting idea.
     I think you'll be taken by it.

Shuster stares at him.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I was a key executive with a major
     advertising agency - one of the
     biggest in the world.

          SHUSTER
     Yes, right.  So?

          DAVID
     Well, I was the Idea Man there.
     So, when I say I have an interesting
     idea, I'm not speaking like any slob
     that walks in off the street.

          SHUSTER
     Okay.

          DAVID
          (clearing his throat,
          about to enter into
          The Big Story)
     My wife and I, we dropped out of
     society.  She had a very important
     position in a department store and
     again, I remind you that I was one
     of the highest executives in the
     world's largest advertising firm.

Shuster just stares at him.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Anyway, we were going to find
     ourselves.  Then, we thought, maybe
     we're too old, it's too late.  We
     can't find ourselves, that's only
     for kids.  And then we thought about
     it some more and it hit us.  Wait a
     minute.  Who's to say at what age
     you stop being a kid?

          SHUSTER
     You gotta have some age.  How else
     could a court separate rape from
     fun?  In this state, it's eighteen,
     by the way.

          DAVID
     Yes.  But my point is we wanted
     to find ourselves and we did and
     we dropped out, just like they
     did in "Easy Rider."

          SHUSTER
     Easy what?

          DAVID
     The movie, "Easy Rider."  Famous
     movie.  Important movie.

          SHUSTER
     Didn't see that, I'm sorry.

          DAVID
     It's a classic.  If it comes on
     cable here, see it.  Anyway, we
     did something that no one has done
     for a long time.  Maybe no one has
     ever done it because in the movie
     they were movie stars, so they
     didn't really do it, even though
     they portrayed people that did it.

          SHUSTER
     I'm getting mixed up here.  What
     is your point?

          DAVID
     Well, we did it for real.  We
     quit our jobs and we sold everything
     that we had.  The only thing we own
     is our little motor home, which is
     parked outside.  That's all we've
     got and we were going to spend
     years roaming around this beautiful
     country, but we knew we couldn't
     do it unless we had our little
     nest egg tucked away in the bank.

          SHUSTER
          (interrupts)
     I'm going off duty in a few minutes.
     Now, your point is what?

          DAVID
     I'm getting to it.  Why did we
     come to Las Vegas?  Because it was
     a new beginning and I wanted to
     remarry my lovely wife.  That's
     nice, don't you think?

          SHUSTER
     Very nice.

          DAVID
     I wanted to get remarried but I
     wanted to spend our honeymoon in
     the Grand Canyon, places like we
     intend to spend the rest of our
     lives in, but my wife is very fond
     of your hotel and all of the
     employees and she said, "Oh, come
     on, let's spend our honeymoon here."
     And we did and the room was very
     lovely and everybody was very nice
     to us, but my wife lost the nest
     egg.

          SHUSTER
     Mr. Howard, stop right here.  I
     think I know what you're getting at.
     I realize you've lost a great deal
     here and I want you to know that
     your room and your meals are comped.

          DAVID
     That's very nice but that's not
     exactly what I'm saying.  I think
     I have a multi-million dollar idea.
     Now, you have to be very secretive
     about what I'm going to tell you
     because the other hotels, if they
     heard about it, well, they'll grab
     it in a minute.

David leans over Shuster's desk and whispers to make
the idea really sound secretive:

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     I think, as an experiment, you
     give us back the money we lost.

          SHUSTER
     I beg your pardon?

          DAVID
     Well, imagine the publicity?  I
     mean, the Hilton, for example,
     they have billboards all over L.A.
     where they put the faces of the
     winners of those slot machines.
     Now, those people win a couple
     hundred thousand dollars, but the
     hotel is getting millions of
     dollars of publicity with those
     billboards because people drive
     by and say, "Gee, the Hilton looks
     like a nice place.  Look at those
     smiling people."  So, what about a
     billboard with my wife and I on it
     and we would be smiling and there
     would be a saying, something like,
     "These people dropped out of society,
     they couldn't take it any longer,
     but they made a mistake.  They
     lost their nest egg at The Desert
     Inn, but The Desert Inn gave it
     back."  And maybe there could be
     some kind of a visual with you
     handing us an egg or something.
     Now I mean, I'm just formulating
     this now, as I'm talking, but you
     can imagine, when it's worked
     out how effective it could be.

          SHUSTER
          (chuckling)
     That's wonderful.
          (he gets up)
     Well, Mr. Howard, nice to meet
     you.

          DAVID
     What do you mean nice to meet
     me?  You said this is wonderful.

          SHUSTER
     We're kidding each other here,
     right?
          (starts to
          laugh again)
     I gotta tell you, this is one of
     the best things I've ever heard.
     What's the board gonna say again?
     "Gamblers, come and get your
     money back."
          (he laughs)
     Great.  That's great.

          DAVID
          (standing up)
     No.  No.  Wait... Not "Gamblers,
     get your money back."
     That's wrong.  We're not gamblers.
     We're the few people in society
     that have tried to do something
     with our lives.  See?  We're drop-
     outs.  We're finding ourselves.
     Someone's got to help the few
     people like us, because if they
     don't, nobody will ever drop out
     again.  Nobody will ever have
     the courage to find themselves.

          SHUSTER
     Well, I understand what you mean,
     but I don't think The Desert Inn
     can help find you.  I'm sorry, but
     thank you for the idea and good
     night.

He begins to escort David to the door.

          DAVID
          (stopping him)
     Listen, I've experienced this
     before.  I've had clients that
     didn't understand the idea until
     they saw it on television and
     then they said, "My God!  What a
     brilliant idea!  Why didn't I
     understand this?" I might have
     used the wrong phrase.  Okay,
     picture this: maybe, my wife
     and I will do a television
     commercial for you and there
     could be a jingle and it could
     go:
          (begins to sing)
     "The Desert Inn has heart!  The
     Desert Inn has heart!  The Desert
     Inn has heart!"  Something like
     that.  See what I mean?

          SHUSTER
     That's a nice jingle.  Mr. Howard,
     let's assume you're serious here.
     What if this caught on?  Could you
     imagine what would happen?  Why,
     we would have to return everybody's
     losses.  The casino would just
     crumble.  We couldn't pay our bills.
     You know the casino accounts for
     a great deal of our profits.

          DAVID
     I understand.  Of course, you don't
     pay back everybody's losses.  You
     make a distinct division between
     the bold, who are out there searching,
     and all the other schmucks, who come
     here to see Wayne Newton.

          SHUSTER
     I see.  Now, I like Wayne Newton.
     So, I fall into what category?

          DAVID
          (realizing this was
          not the best example)
     Oh, look, I picked a name out of a
     hat.  I like Wayne Newton, too.
     I'm saying a schmuck, representing
     the gambler and a bold person,
     representing me and my wife and the
     one or two others that probably
     wouldn't come here anyway.  You
     wouldn't have to do this more than
     once or twice, there's not too many
     bold people around.  I think it was
     a mistake to use entertainers as
     the dividing line.  We could find
     another system.  Anyway, what do
     you say?  We do need that nest egg
     back.

          SHUSTER
     I say good luck to you and stay
     away from the tables next time.

          DAVID
     Oh, that's for sure, but come on?
     Half the money, for courage?

Shuster opens up his office door.  He escorts David out.


30     INT. LOBBY AT FRONT DESK

          SHUSTER
     Mr. Howard, nice to meet you.
     A pleasure.

          DAVID
     Hold it.  What about "Miracle
     on 34th Street?"

          SHUSTER
     Christmas picture, right?

          DAVID
          (now rambling on very
          fast, desperate, rea-
          lizing his plan is
          about to fail)
     More than a Christmas picture.  What
     happened there?  Macy's didn't want
     to send their customers to Gimble's
     because the president of Macy's
     thought they would lose all of their
     customers and lose a tremendous
     amount of money and it would be taken
     wrong.  But it wasn't taken wrong.
     What happened? Macy's did much better
     than they ever did before. And that's
     what would happen to you.  The Desert
     Inn would do much, much better because
     you would get Gimble's business and
     the casino would be full.

          SHUSTER
     Well, I'm not too familiar with
     that picture but didn't Macy's have
     Santa Claus to help them out?
          (he starts to laugh)
     I mean, if they didn't have Santy
     Claus there, they might have done
     very badly.

He continues to laugh.  David now starts to laugh along
with him, except David's laugh has a pitiful ring to it.
He senses this is not going to work.

          DAVID
     Yes.  I guess they did have Santy
     Claus.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.
     And just so I understand, we can t
     get any of our money back, right?

          SHUSTER
     Well, not today, no.  But if the
     policy ever changes, we'll write
     you.
          (still chuckling as
          he goes back into
          his office)
     That's wonderful.  Very good.

He closes the door.  The desk Clerk, who has just seen
Shuster laugh, turns to David, who is standing there
looking as bad as he's ever looked.

          CLERK
     I think he likes you.  He rarely
     laughs at anything.

David just nods a sickly "thank you."

                                   CUT TO:


31     EXT.  MOTOR HOME - DAY

David and Nancy are driving.  They are well outside of
Las Vegas.  Nancy is staring out of the window.  David
is driving in silence.  Obviously, they have been driving
for a great deal of time without saying anything.  Nancy
finally breaks the silence.


32     INT.  MOTOR HOME

          NANCY
     I can't take this.  Say something.
     Yell at me.  Hit me.  Drive off
     the road.  Do anything.  Just stop
     being so silent.

          DAVID
     I have nothing to say.

          NANCY
     I can't keep apologizing.  I'm
     sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
     I feel horrible.  I would do
     anything to change it.

David says nothing.  He just clears his throat.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     You're going to make yourself
     sick.  It's unnatural.  I
     understand.  If I were you, I'd
     be furious.  Don't hold it in.
     Go ahead.

          DAVID
          (looking at her)
     I'm fine.

More silent driving.  Nancy is desperately uncomfort-
able.  Obviously, David is not fine.  How could he be?
He's seen ten years of earnings dissipate in less than
three hours and he didn't participate in any of the
dissipation.  After a while, Nancy tries a new approach.

          NANCY
     Obviously, I can't apologize anymore
     for what I did so we should talk
     about what we're going to do.

          DAVID
     And what would that be?

          NANCY
     Well, our dream is still the same.
     We just don't have any money.

David clears his throat again.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     And, also, we should stop saying
     we don't have any money.  We do
     have some.

          DAVID
          (very patiently)
     We have eight hundred and two
     dollars.

          NANCY
     That's something.

          DAVID
     It is something.  Yes.

          NANCY
     Well, look, I think we should
     try to make the rest of the day
     as pleasant as we can.  Since
     we're heading towards Hoover Dam
     anyway, we should make that our
     destination for today.  We can
     go there, look around, maybe
     have a picnic or something, and
     maybe just see the dam and just
     have a nice day outside.  What
     do you think?

          DAVID
          (staring straight
          ahead, speaking
          in a monotone)
     Is that what you'd like?

          NANCY
     Maybe it would be fun.

          DAVID
          (still staring,
          still speaking
          in a monotone)
     Fine.  Hoover Dam.

                                   CUT TO:


33     EXT. HOOVER DAM - DAY

There are people walking around, tours going on and
children playing.  The motor home pulls up.  They park.
Nancy gets out with a bounce in her step, hoping David
might copy her.  David gets out like Frankenstein,
walking very slowly, with no expression.

          NANCY
     Look at this!  Come here.  God!
     Just think.  Men built this!

          DAVID
          (still with no
          expression)
     Yes.  Men did build this.

          NANCY
     What about something to eat?
     Hungry?

          DAVID
     No.

          NANCY
     I'm starved.

          DAVID
     I don't think you can eat now.

          NANCY
     Why?

          DAVID
     Because with the little bit of
     money that we have left, I think
     we have to sit down and make up
     a new budget.  Until we do, maybe
     we shouldn't spend it all on
     cotton candy and other various
     knickknacks here at the dam.

Nancy is beginning to get irritated and frustrated that
he will not talk to her like an adult.

          NANCY
     Well, if that's your attitude,
     I think you should give me half
     the money and let me eat whatever
     I want and you can do what you
     want with your half.  I think
     that's the fair thing.

          DAVID
          (the release of his
          anger now begins)
     The fair thing?  The fair thing?
     That's it!  You're right.  I've
     been controlled!  Boy, have I
     been controlled!  I guess any
     doctor could have spotted it.
     I was about to die, I was so
     controlled.  You took all the
     money we had!

People can hear this echoing for miles around.

          DAVID
          (continuing; now
          yelling)
     You took our nest egg and you
     broke it up!  You got yoke all
     over the casino!  You got the
     white all over the coffee shop!
     You threw the shells in the
     parking lot!  Fair?  Fair?!
     Where was I when you were
     playing with the egg?  Sleeping.
     Sleeping.  Goddammit!

          NANCY
     Good.  Get it out.

          DAVID
     Shut up!   Don't talk to me like
     I'm an insane patient!

          NANCY
     Let's just go back inside. You
     can yell at me. You should, I
     think it's right. I just don't
     want you to yell out here.

          DAVID
     Out where?  This is where we're
     going to have to live.  Why not
     yell out here?  We're going to have
     to do everything else out here.
     We'll be sleeping out here and
     eating out here and going to the
     bathroom out here!  Get used to
     this cement, baby!  This is it!
     Out here is it!  We found ourselves!
     We found ourselves, alright!  We
     found ourselves with eight hundred
     dollars in the middle of nowhere!

Nancy walks away.  She sees a crowd that is gathered
around and she does not want to have an argument in
front of these people.  David follows her.


34     EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - HOOVER DAM VISITOR AREA

          DAVID
     Where are you going?

          NANCY
     I don't want to have an argument
     in front of those people.

          DAVID
     Why not?  I think those people
     are entitled to know how stupid
     you are.

          NANCY
     This is going to turn into a
     personal attack, isn't it?

          DAVID
     What else?  A general attack?  Who
     am I going to attack?   Nevada?   I
     can't attack the state.  It wasn't
     their fault.  I can't attack the
     motor home. It stayed in the
     parking lot.  I can't attack me.
     I was fast asleep.  By process
     of elimination, who's left?

          NANCY
     I am.  I'm left, okay?  And I'll
     say it one more time - I'm sorry.

They are off by themselves now.  They have reasonable
privacy.  They are both very upset.

          DAVID
     I don't want your apologies.  I
     want to know why?   I want to try
     to understand how it happened.  Tell
     me.  How did it happen?

          NANCY
     I couldn't sleep.

          DAVID
     You couldn't sleep.  I see.  Now,
     I remember nights where I couldn't
     sleep.  I'm just trying to think
     what I did.  Let's see.  I tried
     warm milk or I took a long walk or
     I took Nytol and then, if all that
     didn't work, I gave away all the
     money I ever earned.  But you
     didn't try any of those things
     first.  You just gave away the
     money first, right?  What did you
     intend to do?  Have warm milk
     afterwards?  Tell me.  I'm mixed
     up.

          NANCY
     You're not even listening.

          DAVID
     I'm sorry.  You're right.  Go
     ahead.  You couldn't sleep.  Then
     what happened?

          NANCY
     I don't remember.  I just went
     downstairs.

          DAVID
     Why didn't you wake me up?

          NANCY
     What would you have done?

          DAVID
     What would I have done?  I would
     have followed you.
     I would've seen you.  I would have
     watched you take your money and
     begin to lose it and I would have
     stopped you at thirty dollars,
     maybe thirty-two dollars, at the
     most.  I would have said,
     "Sweetheart, come back to bed.
     We don't want to fool with our
     nest egg."  You know, Nancy, I
     think you just considered nest
     egg to be a term but to me, it
     was a key to this whole experiment.
     Why, I considered it like a third
     person.  It was our best friend,
     our guardian angel.  It was going
     to allow us to do everything we
     wanted to do.  It was going to
     watch over us during bad times
     and laugh with us during good times.
     It was going to help us roam and
     purchase and eat and explore.  It
     was going to help us make love
     and laugh and cry and now, it's
     gone and who's got it?  The Desert
     Inn!  They've got our nest egg.
     They can sure use it, can't they?
     They don't have their own.  They're
     a poor little organization.  They
     need our nest egg.  Gee, I hope
     they use it wisely.  I know someday
     those mirrors are going to have
     to be reflocked and the red velvet
     was looking kind of worn.  And
     those little heart beds are going
     to need new sheets.  I'm glad we
     could help them pay for that.  I'm
     glad our life savings will go
     towards making that room look a
     little prettier.  I'm glad we
     gave it all to them, Nancy.  I'm
     just going to miss the little nest
     egg, that's all.  Won't you,
     sweetheart?  Won't you miss the
     nest egg?  In the middle of the
     night, won't you feel kind of
     lonely because little nest egg
     is paying for the gas in Frank
     Sinatra's limo?

          NANCY
     Shut up, David!
          (begins to cry; she's
          getting hysterical)
     Shut up!  I don't want to hear nest
     egg anymore!  I don't want to hear
     that word.  Let me tell you something.
     That's not the way you drop out
     anyway.  If you're really going to
     drop out, you drop out with nothing!

          DAVID
     You drop out with nothing?  Oh
     where did you read that?  In the
     Las Vegas Guide?

          NANCY
     I didn't read that.  I know that.

          DAVID
     Oh, I see.  Who told you?

          NANCY
     Friends, people who know.  I don't
     have to answer you.

          DAVID
     No.  You don't have to answer me.
     You can't answer me because no one
     ever told you that.  You never
     had friends who dropped out.  You
     don't know anybody who dropped
     out except for us.  So how the
     hell did you know that?  Come on,
     tell me?

          NANCY
     Alright.  The movie you're basing
     your whole life on, "Easy Rider,"
     they dropped out with nothing.
     They had no nest egg.

          DAVID
     Bullshit.  They had a huge nest
     egg.  They sold cocaine.  They
     didn't get on their motorcycles
     till their nest egg was giant,
     fifty times the size of ours.

          NANCY
     That's not true.

          DAVID
     Oh, look.  I'm not going to stand
     here, in front of one of the seven
     wonders of the world and argue about
     an old movie.  I'm going to go now
     and get back in the motor home and
     maybe you can wander around out here
     and figure out something to do.  We
     have eight hundred dollars left and
     an entire lifetime.  See what you
     can come up with.

David starts to walk away.

          NANCY
     We could sell cocaine.

          DAVID
          (stops and turns
          around)
     Well, my God.  Why didn't I think
     of that?  Great idea.  As a matter-
     of-fact, I remember after seeing
     "Midnight Express" I went out of
     the theater saying to myself, "That's
     for me.  Sex with hundreds of
     Turkish men."

David turns around and walks towards the motor home.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Come on.  Let's go.

Nancy doesn't go with him.

          NANCY
     No.  Forget it.

          DAVID
     Forget what?

          NANCY
     Forget everything.

          DAVID
     What are you talking about?

          NANCY
     You know, I'll tell you one good
     thing that came out of all of this.
     We forgot to get remarried.  That
     was one good thing that happened
     and no one has mentioned that yet.

          DAVID
     What are you saying?

          NANCY
     I'm saying that if we got remarried
     it would be much more difficult to
     get divorced.  Now it's easy.  It's
     over.  I'll just stay in Nevada for
     six weeks and then we'll be legally
     through.  This is how it should
     have happened anyway, David.  We
     were stupid to think it could have
     happened any other way.

          DAVID
     Do you really believe that?

          NANCY
     You bet your life I do.  I realize
     now, you're never going to let me
     forget this.  For the rest of our
     lives, you'll blame me and I won't
     take it.  So, goodbye.  I'm sorry.
     It didn't work out.


35     EXT. SIDE OF ROAD

Nancy walks to the side of the road and sticks out her
thumb.  David walks after her.

          DAVID
     What do you expect to do?  Where
     do you think you're going?

          NANCY
     I still have my dreams.  I'll have
     to find somebody else who understands
     them a little bit better and then
     I'll start over.

          DAVID
     Okay.  Enough is enough. I
     understand your dreams. You said,
     "Explode."  I exploded. It's done.
     Now, come on.  Let's not act stupid.
     I'm over it.

          NANCY
          (crying)
     You'll never be over it. I know
     you.  You're right.  I'm stupid.
     You don't want to be with a
     stupid person so leave me alone.

          DAVID
     What are you doing?

          NANCY
     None of your business. Now get
     out of here, please.

          DAVID
     You told me to be angry.  You said
     it was unhealthy not to be angry.
     You'd be angry, too.  God knows
     you'd be angry.

We see a car approaching in the distance.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Nancy, there's a car coming and
     there's a man in there who looks
     like an animal.  Now if you don't
     put your thumb back, he's going
     to pick you up and if he picks
     you up, you're going to be in
     his car.  I don t know him.  You
     don't know him.  We don't know
     where we are, so why don't we
     stop acting like this?!

          NANCY
     Goodbye.

          DAVID
          (yelling)
     What is happening?  You said it
     fifteen hundred times, "Get
     angry."  I got angry.  I thought
     I got angry well.  I'm over it.

          NANCY
     Sure you're over it. You're
     still yelling.

          DAVID
     I'm yelling because you're about
     to get in someone else's car!

An old Chevy pulls over.  A guy in his late thirties,
large, ugly, RED-NECK-looking fellow says to Nancy:

          RED-NECK
     Where ya headin'?

          NANCY
     With you.

          RED-NECK
     Alright.  You got it.  Come on.

Nancy gets in the car.  David starts to run after them.

          DAVID
          (yelling)
     This has gotten out of hand.  Look
     around you, Nancy, you're in another
     car!  That man is not me!  Nancy!
     I apologize!  I'm sorry!

David stops yelling.  He just stands there for a minute.

          DAVID
          (continuing; to
          himself)
     Listen to what I'm saying.  I was
     sleeping and I'm yelling I'm sorry.
     What's going on?  Jesus Christ!
     She's going to get killed!


36     EXT. ROAD TO HOOVER - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

David runs back to the motor home.  He starts the
engine.  David tries to catch up to the Chevy.  The
Chevy's gotten a large lead.  He goes faster but it
doesn't help.  He loses the car.

                                   CUT TO:


37      INT. MOTOR HOME

          DAVID
          (mumbling)
     I've lost my wife in the desert.
     This is just silly.  You lose
     your wallet or your keys but I've
     lost a whole woman.

David continues to drive.  After a short while, he spots
a road stop, a gas-food-rest stop.

There's a small restaurant.  He spots the Chevy.  He
pulls in.  David gets out of the motor home.  Through
the window, he can see this Red-Neck and Nancy sitting
at a table.

                                   CUT TO:


38      INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT

David walks in.  He approaches the table where Nancy
and the Red-Neck are sitting.

          DAVID
     Nancy, I think we should go.

          RED-NECK
     I don't think she wants to speak
     to you, buddy.

          DAVID
     I've known her for a long time.
     I think I would rather have direct
     communication with her.  Nancy,
     come on.

          RED-NECK
     I said she don't want to talk to
     you.

          DAVID
     We're leaving now, okay, honey?

          RED-NECK
     You're not listenin', are you?

          DAVID
     I'm listening.  This is my wife.
     It's between her and me.   Nancy?
     We're going to work things out
     now.  Thank this gentleman for
     the ride and let's go.

Nancy says nothing.  The Red-Neck stands up.  He is huge.

          RED-NECK
     Mister, I'm gonna count to three
     and I want you out of here.  One...

          DAVID
     Nancy, this man's counting.  Who
     is he?

          RED-NECK
     Two.

          DAVID
     Honey, there's one number left.

          RED-NECK
     Three.

The Red-Neck takes David by the shoulder and starts to
lead him outside.

          RED-NECK
          (continuing)
     Let's go.  You and I, we have
     some fighting to do.

David is being shoved outside.  He looks back at Nancy.

          DAVID
     Is this what you want?  Is this
     what was supposed to happen?  I'm
     now going to be killed by a gorilla?

David and the Red-Neck are outside.  Nancy realizes
David is probably right.  He will be killed.  She gets
up.  She runs after them.


39     EXT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT

By the time she gets outside, David is already being
punched in the stomach and then in the face.  In be-
tween punches, David is yelling to Nancy:

          DAVID
     Call him off!  He'll obey you!
     Tell him it's alright!

The Red-Neck is now really angry.

          RED-NECK
     I hate you.  I'm going to kill you.

          NANCY
     It's okay.  Stop.  Please?  Thank
     you for the ride but we can handle it.

          RED-NECK
     You're out of this now.  This is
     between him and me.
     I haven't hated somebody so much
     in a long time.  He reminds me
     of everything I hate.

David is on the ground.  The Red-Neck picks him up.

          RED-NECK
     Come on.  Come on.  Let's really
     go at it.

          DAVID
     This is going to disappoint you
     but I have really gone at it.
     I haven't had a fight since I
     was in the third grade.  I'm just
     not used to it.  Nancy, tell him.

          NANCY
     Please!  It's okay.  My husband
     and I had a fight but we can handle
     it.

          RED-NECK
     I said get out, lady.  I'm on a
     mission now.

Nancy, realizing that she can't stop the fight, begins to
scream:

          NANCY
     Help!  Help!  Police!  Help!
     Murder! Help!

People start to come out of the restaurant.  This is more
attention than the Red-Neck wanted.

          RED-NECK
     Well, look at this.  A woman has
     to help you by yelling for the
     police.  Well, if I wasn't wanted,
     I wouldn't care.  I'd stay here
     and beat the shit out of you, but
     right now I can't afford to see
     the police.  But I'll get you.  I
     don't know where or when, but I'll
     get you, mister.

The Red-Neck starts to walk back to his car.

          DAVID
     Yell "Police!" more.  Keep yelling.

          NANCY
     Police!  Police!

We see the Red-Neck hasten a bit. He starts his engine.

          DAVID
     More.  Yell.  Yell.  Police!
     Help!  Help!

The Chevy pulls out.  The Red-Neck yells back:

          RED-NECK
     I'll get you.

David is holding his jaw.

          NANCY
     Are you alright?

          DAVID
     That man will spend the rest of
     his life trying to find me.  I'll
     be killed, Nancy.

Nancy helps him towards the motor home.


40     INT. MOTOR HOME

They get inside.  David is holding his jaw.

          NANCY
     Are you sure you're okay?

          DAVID
     Yeah, I'm okay.  Next time, if
     you're going to hitch, get a ride
     with a small woman, will you?

          NANCY
     I'm proud of you.

          DAVID
     For what?  Getting beat up?

          NANCY
     For rescuing me.

          DAVID
     Well, I had no choice really.  I
     thought about just forgetting it
     and finding someone new, but I
     realized I had nothing to offer
     them.

          NANCY
     David, listen to me... We're going
     to be alright.

          DAVID
     I hope so.  Maybe we will.

David starts the engine.  The home slowly begins to
move.

          NANCY
     What do you think we should do
     first?

          DAVID
     First?  First, I think we fill this
     thing with gas so we can get as far
     away as possible from that mental
     patient.  Then, I guess we'll head
     east.  We'll drive until we find a
     place we both like and that'll be
     our new home. We'll start there
     and we'll begin to rebuild.

          NANCY
     I swear to God I think this is a
     blessing in disguise.  The whole
     idea of going to Las Vegas was to
     get remarried so we could have a
     new beginning, right?  Well, that
     would've just been a ceremony.  Now,
     we really are starting from the
     beginning.  I think this way is
     much better.

          DAVID
     Well, I hope it is.  But since we
     really will never know the other
     way, let's not compare.

          NANCY
     But after all, the whole purpose
     was to find ourselves and to be
     free and now we really are free.
     The other way...

          DAVID
          (interrupting)
     Hold it, honey.  Another comparison,
     right?

          NANCY
     Well, I'm just excited.  I think
     this is a blessing.

          DAVID
     It very well might be.  All I'm
     saying is let's just let our
     original plan rest in peace.

A)  We see the motor home driving along.  In the
background there is MUSIC.  As they head east,
the sun slowly is setting behind them.  After
various SHOTS of David and Nancy moving along
the desert...

B) ... we finally see them pass a sign that says,
"WELCOME TO PRESCOTT, ARIZONA."

C)  They drive on further until they pull up to a
trailer park.  The sign above the park says,
"PRESCOTT TRAILER PARK."  He stops.  He pulls
the motor home into this park.  He sticks his
head out the window, as if to feel the climate.
It feels right.

42     INT.  MOTOR HOME

The sun has set.  This is where they've chosen to live.
Nancy is lying on the bed as David is at the kitchen
table, figuring out the money they have left.

          DAVID
     Okay, so, gas and the payment
     here and the electricity hook-up,
     the water hook-up, lunch... Oh my!

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     Three hundred and twenty dollars.

He takes that amount out of his pocket.  He lays it out
in front of then, like a magician doing a card trick.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     There it is, sweetheart.  That's it.

          NANCY
     Okay. Let's call this "emergency"
     money. We'll get jobs right away
     so we don't have to touch this.

          DAVID
     Absolutely.  This money we seal away.

          NANCY
     We'll both have jobs by tomorrow.
     It's going to be good.

          DAVID
     We have no choice.  We have to
     have jobs by tomorrow.

          NANCY
     We should celebrate tonight.

          DAVID
     Celebrate what?

          NANCY
     This!  This is the real beginning!

David sits there.  He smiles.  He's staring at Nancy.
After a while he feels a little uncomfortable.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     What's the matter?  What are you
     staring at?

          DAVID
     Your legs.  They look different.

          NANCY
     Different?

          DAVID
     They look longer.

          NANCY
     You're joking, right?

          DAVID
     No.

          NANCY
     I have long legs, remember?

          DAVID
     Remember what?

          NANCY
     That was the first thing you
     ever said to me.  You said I
     had sexy long legs.  That was
     before you even asked me my
     name.

          DAVID
     My God.  You're right.  We talked
     about your legs for a long time
     before your name came up.  Was I
     rude?

          NANCY
     You were great.

          DAVID
     You didn't think I was so sexy
     the first time you saw me, did
     you?

          NANCY
     Yes I did.

          DAVID
     You didn't say anything.

          NANCY
     Yes I did.

          DAVID
     No you didn't.


          NANCY
     Yes.  I remember I told you I
     thought curly hair was very,
     very sexy.  I said I liked your
     hair.

          DAVID
     No, sweetheart, you said curly
     hair was sexy and then you asked
     me if that was my own hair.

          NANCY
     Well, I was shy.

          DAVID
     Don't worry.  I took it as a
     compliment.

Nancy smiles.  David walks over and gives her a passionate
kiss, the likes of which we have not yet seen in this film.
They begin to make love.  It's the real thing.  As they do
we...

43     EXT. MOTOR HOME

We hear MOANING.  We see the home rocking gently back
and forth.  Older people who live in the trailer park
start to come out and watch this new residence move
from side to side. Some have folding chairs, others
have picnic baskets.  This is one trailer park that
hasn't yet put in cable television.  So, to these
people, this is entertainment they so badly needed.

We SLOWLY...

                                   DISSOLVE INTO:


44     INT. MOTOR HOME - NEXT MORNING

David is still in bed. Nancy is almost dressed. She has
an extraordinary amount of energy.

          NANCY
     David, I love you.  That was the
     best.  It was amazing.

David is a bit dazed.  Obviously they've had the best sex
of their lives.  It's given her energy.  It's made him a
little confused.

          DAVID
     It never happened like that in
     L.A.  I wonder why?

          NANCY
     We stopped having sex in L.A.

          DAVID
     That must be it.

          NANCY
     Seriously.  What do you really
     think happened?  What did we do
     right?

          DAVID
     I don't think it had anything to
     do with us.

          NANCY
     What was it?  The air?

          DAVID
     Maybe.  My guess is extreme poverty.

          NANCY
     Well, then I say we should stay poor.

          DAVID
     Look, I was just guessing.  I think
     we have to make some money, we don't
     want to starve to death and then find
     out it really was the air.  We'll
     feel so stupid.

          NANCY
          (smiles)
     I have so much energy.  I can't
     wait to get out and just explore
     this city.  I'm going to get a
     great job.  I know it.

David gets out of bed.  He puts on his robe.

          DAVID
     Me, too.  Now, I think we should
     have some kind of a plan.  What do
     you say we look for work together?

          NANCY
     I don't think so.  I think we
     should go in separate directions.

          DAVID
     Why?

          NANCY
     We'll cover more territory.

          DAVID
     Alright.  That sounds right.  Good.
     Good idea.

          NANCY
     Let's say we meet back here no
     later than five o'clock.

          DAVID
     Five o'clock.  Good.

          NANCY
          (kissing him)
     I can't wait for five o'clock.

Nancy exits.  David stands at the door calling out to
her:

          DAVID
     Good luck!  Go for the high pay!

          NANCY
     I know.

          DAVID
     And buy a cheap lunch!

          NANCY
     Don't worry.

          DAVID
     I love you.

          NANCY
     I love you, too.

          DAVID
     I mean it!  Cheap lunch!

We see Nancy wave as she walks off into the distance.

David is walking down the street staring into various
stores.  He stops in front of a pharmacy.  There's a
sign that says:  "DELIVERY MAN WANTED."  David enters
the store.

David approaches PHARMACIST.

          DAVID
     Hello?

          PHARMACIST
     Yes sir.

          DAVID
     The delivery job, I'm interested
     in it.

          PHARMACIST
     This is for your son?

          DAVID
     No, for me.

          PHARMACIST
     For you?  Well, you have your own
     car? -

          DAVID
     No.

          PHARMACIST
     Gee, I'm sorry, but it's a delivery
     job.  You would need a car.

          DAVID
     Well, I have transportation.  I
     own a motor home.

          PHARMACIST
     A motor home?

          DAVID
     Yes.

          PHARMACIST
     I don't really think that would
     suit this particular job.  I have
     just a few small deliveries a
     day.  Those things aren't too
     efficient and you probably wouldn't
     be able to pay for gas with what
     I'd pay you.

          DAVID
     Oh, I didn't know I'd have to pay
     for my own gas.

          PHARMACIST
     Yes.  Actually, my intention was
     to get a high school kid with a
     Rabbit or something.
     I think an older man with a motor
     home would be impractical for the
     both of us.  You understand, I don't
     have that many deliveries.  Also,
     you'd have trouble parking.  I
     don't think this would work out.

          DAVID
     I agree.

          PHARMACIST
     You know what I should do?  I should
     cross out "man" and put "boy,"
     "delivery boy" is more correct.
     I guess "delivery man" is misleading.

          DAVID
     No, the sign's alright.  It looks
     fine.  You don't know of any
     immensely high-paying jobs in the
     immediate area, do you?

          PHARMACIST
     Um, let me think.  No, not in the
     immediate area.

          DAVID
     What about in the outlying areas?

          PHARMACIST
     Uh, no.  I don't know of any high-
     paying jobs anywhere in the whole
     country.  Do you?

          DAVID
     Um, no.  Not now.  Well, good day.

          PHARMACIST
     Good day to you.

          DAVID
     Is there an employment agency in
     this town?

          PHARMACIST
     Yes.  Just continue down this
     street about half a mile.  It's
     a small building but you can't
     miss it.

47      INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE

It's a small employment agency befitting a small town.
David is just sitting and waiting his turn along with
various other types.  David looks a little out of
place in that the others look like they want some job
relating to alcohol.  The AGENT steps out of a small
glass cubicle and asks David to step in.  David does
and sits down.

          AGENT
     So.  What can we do for you?

          DAVID
     Well, I'm originally from Los
     Angeles and I'm now living here.
     I need a job.

          AGENT
     Alright.

He takes out a piece of paper and begins to write down
information.

          AGENT
          (continuing)
     What was your previous working
     experience?

          DAVID
     Well, for the last eight years I
     was a major executive with one of
     the biggest advertising agencies
     in the country.

          AGENT
     Oh, I see.  And your previous salary?

          DAVID
     Seventy thousand dollars.

          AGENT
          (looks up; he hasn't
          heard this figure
          in a long time)
     You said seventy thousand?

          DAVID
     Yes.

          AGENT
     Over how long a period are we
     talking about?

          DAVID
     A year.  Seventy thousand a year.

The Agent begins to laugh.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     What's so funny?

          AGENT
     Nothing.  That's very good.  So,
     what brings you around these parts?
     Trying to double up that income?

Agent laughs again.

          DAVID
     No.  I came here to live.  I
     wanted to change my life.

          AGENT
     You couldn't change your life
     on seventy thousand?

          DAVID
     Could we just get back to what
     we're doing here?

          AGENT
     Sure.  Uh, I don't think I have
     anything at all right now.  I
     mean the only thing I have, you
     wouldn't be interested in.  Why
     don't you check back with me in
     a month?

          DAVID
     Well, you don't know what I'd be
     interested in.  Why don't you just
     tell me what you have?

          AGENT
     I don't think that coming from
     your position and your salary
     you'd be interested in it.

          DAVID
     Well, you don't know me.  What is
     it?

          AGENT
     It's a crossing guard.

          DAVID
     A crossing guard?  You mean at a
     school?

          AGENT
     Yes.  Where else do you see them
     work?

          DAVID
     No, I just didn't know if there
     were different kinds.  Well, what
     does that pay?

          AGENT
     A hundred thousand dollars.

He starts to laugh.  David laughs along with him.

          DAVID
     But, really, what does it pay?

          AGENT
     It pays three twenty-five an hour,
     plus benefits.

          DAVID
     Benefits meaning what?

          AGENT
     Benefits meaning you can get a
     ride to and from work if you need
     it.

          DAVID
     Well, listen, I've just started
     looking for work and I don't want
     to rule anything out but I think
     I probably can find something where
     I can use my ability a bit more.
     Would you have another kind of
     file, like an executive box or
     something?

          AGENT
     What kind of box would that be?

          DAVID
     You know, a box of higher-paying
     jobs.

          AGENT
     My goodness, I forgot.  Sure.
     You mean the hundred thousand
     dollar box?

Agent begins to laugh again.

          DAVID
          (getting up)
     Well, I'm happy I could provide
     you with your morning's entertainment.
     You can laugh at me but let me
     tell you something.  I made a
     statement.  You understand what
     I'm saying?  I made a statement.

          AGENT
     A statement?

          DAVID
     Never mind.  Thank you.

     Sure looks like it.

          DAVID
     Fantastic!
          (he sits down)
     Tell me everything.  What is it?
     How much do you get?  When do
     you start?

          NANCY
     I won't know anything for sure
     until tomorrow.  I don't want to
     say anything until then.

          DAVID
     Oh come on!  Tell me?  At least
     tell me what the job is.

          NANCY
     Please.  We'll get all excited and
     then what if I don't get it?  Let's
     just wait.

          DAVID
     Just give me a hint!

          NANCY
     Well... alright.  I would be
     an assistant manager.

          DAVID
     Jesus!  After one day?  Assistant
     manager!  Where?

          NANCY
     That's all I'm saying. The manager's
     thinking it over.  He said he'll let
     me know tomorrow.  I don't want to
     jinx it.  Now, come on.  Let's hear
     about you.  What happened?

David can't get over the words "Assistant Manager."  His
own search hasn't brought him words of that caliber.
He hedges.

          DAVID
     Well, I'm not saying anything
     either, but I'll also know in
     the morning.

          NANCY
     I gave you a hint, you have to
     give me one.

          DAVID
     I can't.  I have too many leads.
     I've had many firm offers and
     right now I'm just mulling them
     over.

          NANCY
     What kind of offers?

          DAVID
     Listen, I think you're right, we're
     going to jinx this thing.  Let's
     just keep the mystery.  It's more
     exciting that way.

                                   CUT TO:


50     INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - THE NEXT DAY

David is standing with an older MAN in front of a
locker.  The Man takes out a uniform.

          MAN
     Now, this won't fit you exactly
     'cause the fellow who had this
     before was about eighty and very
     heavy, but if you go up to the
     nurse's office they'll take it in.

          DAVID
     Thank you.

          MAN
     Now, I don't have the sign here,
     but do you understand?  It's stop
     on one side...

          DAVID
          (interrupts)
     Yes.  Go on the other.

          MAN
     No.  If you're going to interrupt
     me I'm not going to be able to
     explain it.  It's stop an one
     side and stop on the other.  It's
     just a stop sign.  So, when you
     want people to go you'll have to
     hide the sign.

          DAVID
     That's right. I remember.  You
     just put it down so people can't
     see.

          MAN
     That's right.  Behind your back
     is generally the best place.

          DAVID
     Yes.  I think, basically, this job
     hasn't changed since I went to
     school.

          MAN
     Aren't you a little young for this
     kind of work?

          DAVID
     I don't think so.  Why?

          MAN
     Well, all the other guards here
     have been in their late sixties or
     seventies.  We had one who was
     fifty once but that's as young
     as I can remember.

          DAVID
     Well, times are changing.  I
     mean stereotypes have to be
     broken sometime, don't they?

          MAN
     I guess they do.  I never thought
     they did but yeah, I guess they do.
     Okay.  Happy to have you here and I
     guess all you should know is that
     some of these children are rude.

          DAVID
     Well, all children are rude.

          MAN
     Well, these children are a little
     ruder than they used to be.  You
     see we had this cutback in the
     school lunch program and sometimes
     they're hungry.  And you know what
     happens when you're hungry?  You
     get a little bit ornery.  I guess
     what I'm saying is you'll need a
     little bit of tolerance.

          DAVID
     Oh, tolerance is my middle name.
     Believe me.

                                   CUT TO:


51     EXT. STREET SCENE - DAY

David is at the crosswalk.  He's leading a group of
CHILDREN across the street.  They are about twelve
years old.  Obviously, old enough to cross by them-
selves.  David greets them.  He wants to make a good
impression.  God knows why.

          DAVID
     Hello, children.  How was school?

          CHILD #1
     Screw you!

                                   CHILD #2
     Yeah.  Mind your own business.

          DAVID
     Ah.  You must be two of the hungry
     ones.

The Kids glare at him. David walks back across the
street alone. David is waiting. A bunch of KIDS, a
little older, about six of them, walk up.  One of them
says:

          OLDER KID #1
     Hey, who's the new Retardo?

          DAVID
     Oh, my goodness. More hungry
     children.  You want to cross the
     street?

          OLDER KID #1
     Yeah, Retardo.

          DAVID
     My name is David. I would appreciate
     not being called that name.  It's an
     ugly name.

          OLDER KID #2
     Ugly name for an ugly face.

          DAVID
     I see no reason to walk future
     prisoners across the street.  Why
     don't you get some practice working
     on your own right now since you'll
     probably be in solitary most of your
     life.  You can handle it.

          OLDER KID #2
     No, man.  That's what you're paid
     for.  Come on.  Take us across the
     street.

          DAVID
     No, I can't take you across the
     street and, also, I'm allowed to
     make judgments.  If I think someone
     shouldn't be allowed to cross the
     street I'm allowed to deny them
     that privilege.  So, if you want
     to cross, you'll have to cross on
     your own.

          OLDER KID #2
     Hey, no.  No, man.  You work for
     us.  Let's go.

          DAVID
     What do you mean let's go? Is
     that a threat?  Be careful. I've
     got a metal sign here.

          OLDER KID #2
          (takes out a knife)
     Yeah?  I've got a metal knife.

          DAVID
     Knife wins.  Come on.

He leads them across the street.  David walks back alone,
mumbling.  He sits in his little chair.  There's no
action and no children.  Cars are passing by.  A new
black MERCEDES SCREECHES UP.  The passenger window is
electrically lowered.  A GUY, in his early 30's, calls
to David.

          DRIVER
     Mister?

          DAVID
     Call me David.  I'm your age.  I
     look a little older because I'm
     in this uniform.

          DRIVER
     David, how do I get out of this
     place?  Actually, what is this
     place?

          DAVID
     What do you mean?

          DRIVER
     What town is this?

          DAVID
     Prescott.

          DRIVER
     Jesus Christ.  I'm lost.  How do
     I get to Phoenix?

          DAVID
     You have to get on Highway 90.  So,
     what you do is go down about two
     miles, you'll come to a stoplight,
     you turn right and keep going and
     you'll see a sign.

          DRIVER
     Two miles down and then right?

          DAVID
     That's it.

          DRIVER
     Thanks, man.

          DAVID
     Hold it.

David approaches the car.  He sticks his head inside and
starts sniffing, rather intensely.

          DRIVER
     What are you doing?  Stop doing
     that.  Get away.

          DAVID
     I'm just smelling the interior.
     This is leather, isn't it?

          DRIVER
     It's Mercedes Leather.  They call
     it leather but it's vinyl.  Smells
     like leather, though.  Huh?

          DAVID
          (still sniffing)
     Yeah it does.  You like this car?

          DRIVER
     What's not to like?  Hey, thanks,
     man.  See ya.

He floors it and tears off into the distance.  David
watches the car slowly disappear.  He's still sniffing.

          DAVID
          (to himself)
     It smelled like leather.  They
     must spray it with something.

Interrupting David's thought is a CHILD'S VOICE coming
from behind him.

          CHILD
     Hey, Retardo!  Over here!

          DAVID
          (to himself)
     Without even looking I'm sure he
     means me.

                                   CUT TO:


52     INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHTTIME

David enters.  Nancy is taking off her coat.  David can
see that she has on a uniform.  It's a candy-striped
short skirt and blouse.  Also, she has on a candy-
striped apron and hat.  It looks familiar but David
can't quite place it.

          DAVID
     Hi.

Nancy turns around.

          NANCY
     My God!  You scared me.

They stare at each other, each looking at the other's
uniform.

          NANCY
          (continuing)
     You got your job?

          DAVID
     Yes.  Did you get yours?

          NANCY
     Yes.  Yes, I did.

          DAVID
     Is that a uniform you're wearing?

          NANCY
     Of course.  What did you think, I
     bought this?

          DAVID
     What do you do?

          NANCY
     I work at Burger King.  I got
     it.  I'm the assistant manager.

          DAVID
     Burger King?

          NANCY
     The reason I wasn't sure last
     night was because the manager said
     he needed time to sleep on it, but
     this morning he told me he made his
     decision as soon as I left.  He just
     didn't know how to get hold of me.

          DAVID
     Hold it a second.  Burger King?
     The hamburger place?

Just after David finishes this sentence, we hear the
TOILET FLUSH.  Out comes SKIP, a nineteen-year-old boy,
dressed in the male version of the same uniform Nancy
is wearing.  Skip is one of those kids who talks like
he's from Torrance, through his nose, blending all syl-
lables into one, a kid whose speech could mask his
intelligence, if there was intelligence to be masked.

          DAVID
          (continuing)
     Nancy, who's this child?

          NANCY
     Oh.  This is Skip.  He's the
     manager.  He wanted to see
     where we live.

David just stares.  His image of the "Manager" was
obviously way off.

          SKIP
     Hey, thanks, Nancy.  Wow, this is
     like a real home.  Now, when you
     flush the toilet, where does it go?

Before Nancy can answer, Skip sees David.

          SKIP
          (continuing)
     Oh, wow!  Who's the crossing guard?

          NANCY
     That's what you are!  A crossing
     guard!  I couldn't place it.  That's
     wonderful!  You're working with
     children!

          DAVID
     I'm walking with children.  There's
     a difference, but we'll talk about
     it later.  Now, tell me again.
     This child is who?

          NANCY
     This is Skip.  He's the manager.

          DAVID
     The manager?  This is who slept
     on it?

Skip stretches his hand out eagerly wiping it first
on his pants, just to make sure it's clean.

          SKIP
     Hey, it's nice to meet you.  Call
     me Skippy, though, huh?  That's what
     my friends call me.  Hey, your wife's
     really something.  Man, I think what
     you're both doing is amazing.  She
     told me all about it.  It's really
     great.  You've got a lot of courage.
     It blew my mind.  I'll tell ya, man,
     when I get old, I sure hope I drop
     out.  It really sounds neat.  Hey,
     did she tell ya what happened today?

          NANCY
          (a little embarrassed)
     David just got home, Skip.  I'll
     tell him later.

          DAVID
     No.  Let Skippy tell it.   I want
     to hear him talk some more.

          SKIPPY
     Hey, thanks.  Well, you know the
     fry machine?  We were never using
     it right.  See, no one ever told
     us.  I mean we did everything the
     instructions said.  You know, we
     put the oil in and everything, but
     we took the fries out, like, much
     too soon and no one knew.  And
     your wife said, "Hey, these are
     frozen in the middle."  And then
     we took them outside and we looked
     at 'em in the sun and she was
     right!  They were still frozen.
     She spotted it on the first day!
     Do you believe it?

          DAVID
     And how long were you making them
     the other way?

          SKIPPY
     Oh, I don't know, a little less
     than a year.

          DAVID
     Nancy, where are the keys?

          NANCY
     They're in the ignition.  Why?

                                   CUT TO:


53      INT. MOTOR HOME

We are somewhere outside of Prescott.  David and Nancy
are driving along.  They are still in their Burger King
and crossing guard outfits, but obviously they have left
their first home.  Nancy has a map in her hand.  She's
looking it over.

          NANCY
     You know I think Denver could be
     a good place to go.

          DAVID
     Denver, huh?

          NANCY
     Well, it's bigger.  We do need a
     bigger city.

          DAVID
     We certainly do.  Sweetheart,
     let's talk for a second.

          NANCY
     What?

          DAVID
     I love you very much.  You know
     that, don't you?

          NANCY
     I love you, too.

          DAVID
     Well, I think it's wonderful that
     we could say this and mean it.  Do
     you know that ever since we were
     married I just was waiting for us
     to get divorced?  I never thought
     we would make it, ever.  But now
     I do.

          NANCY
     I know.  I feel the same way.

          DAVID
     Well, my God, that's wonderful.
     I mean the experiences that we
     went through in the last two weeks,
     it did that.  It showed us that
     we're going to be married forever.
     Nancy, we're together for the rest
     of our lives and I'm so grateful
     to finally have that peace of
     mind. It's wonderful.

          NANCY
     I told you this would all be a
     blessing.

          DAVID
     I know you did.  But now, let's
     talk facts.  Our nest egg broke.
     Forget who did it, no blame.
     That's not the point.  The point
     is we didn't split up.
     We stayed together and decided to
     rebuild.  And it was the best
     decision we ever made.  Because
     for the first time we really know
     how to share.  Whatever we have we
     can enjoy it together.

          NANCY
     But we don't have anything.

          DAVID
     There!  Now we're getting to it.
     This afternoon I was guiding some
     children across the street and I
     realized something.  Given our age,
     and the years we have left together,
     and the way we're going about this
     rebuilding program, we will never
     have another egg in our lifetime.

          NANCY
     I was thinking the same thing.

          DAVID
     Really?

          NANCY
     Yes.  As a matter-of-fact, I began
     thinking what we might do to speed
     things up.

          DAVID
     That's amazing.  So was I.  Denver?
     Is that what Denver is about?

          NANCY
     No.  Not exactly.  I was just kind
     of thinking of a general plan.

          DAVID
     Me too.

          NANCY
     Great.  What?

          DAVID
     Well, you tell me yours first.

          NANCY
          (hesitating)
     No, you go first.

          DAVID
     No.  I'm almost embarrassed to
     tell you, mine's like a last resort.

          NANCY
     Don't be embarrassed.  What is it?

          DAVID
          (hesitating)
     Well...

          NANCY
     Come on.

          DAVID
     Okay.  I thought we'd just get to
     New York as fast as we can...

          NANCY
          (interrupts)
     And you eat shit?

          DAVID
     Your plan too, huh?

          NANCY
     Exactly.

          DAVID
     We really are a team.

          NANCY
     We certainly are.

                                   CUT TO:


54      EXT./INT. MOTOR HOME - MONTAGE - DAY

It does a fast U-turn away from the northern direction
and begins heading east.  They are now on their way
to New York going as fast as they can.  As they do the
THEME from the commercial "I LOVE NEW YORK" BEGINS TO
PLAY.  It grows and grows in intensity as David and
Nancy cross the United States.  Their trip from Arizona
to New York will take place in a space of about thirty
seconds.  States whiz by.  Signs "ENTERING MISSOURI"
"LEAVING MISSOURI" "ENTERING VIRGINIA," "LEAVING
VIRGINIA," all taking place in a period of seconds.  The
MUSIC is getting more intense. It's now filling our
ears. VOICES BEGIN SINGING, "I LOVE NEW YORK."


55     EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NEW YORK CITY -
SNOW - DAY

We see the mobile home approaching the George Washington
Bridge.  As it enters the tollbooth we...

                                   CUT TO:


56     EXT. MADISON AVENUE - SNOW

It's Monday morning, 8:45.  Thousands of New Yorkers
are filing into their offices.  We see the motor home
pull up in front of the advertising agency.  Hundreds of
people are entering this building.  We see that one of
these people is Brad Tooley, the baldheaded man David
was supposed to work under. From a LONG SHOT, we see
David exit the motor home. He's still in his crossing
guard uniform.  He's been up for three days, taking No
Doz and drinking hundreds of cups of coffee.  He looks
like hell.  He runs down the street and corners Brad
near the front entrance.  Brad sees David.  He's scared.
He can't believe it. He starts to run.  He tries to
escape.  David turns after him.  All this is shown in a
LONG SHOT, with the busy Madison Avenue traffic in the
foreground.  We hear David yelling:

          DAVID
     Brad, I made it!  Three weeks on
     the button! Let's go to work.
     We got Fords to sell!

Brad looks frightened. He'd like to get away but he
can't.  David catches up to him.  He grabs him around
the waist.  He drops to his knees.  He begins to plead.
As New Yorkers pass by going about their business, we
see David begging.  Brad just staring down at him.

OVER THIS SCENE the following CRAWL appears on the screen:

     "Most people lead their entire lives
          without ever having the courage to
     break the mold, to find out who they
     really are and what life is all about.

     Those that do should take Route 16.
     This goes through Utah, avoiding the state
     of Nevada completely."
