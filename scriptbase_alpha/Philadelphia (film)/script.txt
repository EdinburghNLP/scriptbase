FADE IN:

VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ...

which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market,
scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers,
Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the
ghettos of North Philly.

MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a
SHOT OF...

                                                  CUT TO:

PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ...

TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall."

CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS
pour into City Hall, into...

                                                  TO:

TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY).

Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying
an accordion file under his arm like a football.

Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.

Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time

                                                  TO:

JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS
making a racket...

Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."

RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:

                              JOSEPH MILLER (OS)
                    This construction site is
                    causing mortal and irreparable
                    harm to an unsuspecting public!

                              ANDREW BECKETT (OS)
                    My client has one of the finest
                    and most respected safety records
                    in the business, Your Honor!

Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO
CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT
(in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).

                              JUDGE TATE
                    One at a time. Mr. Miller?

                              JOE
                    Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp.
                    began construction, the
                    surrounding residential
                    neighborhood has been enshrouded
                    in a cloud of foul-smelling,
                    germ-carrying, pestilent dust.
                    My client is being forced to
                    breathe known carcinogens daily!
                    Other residents are coming forth
                    on a daily basis to add their
                    voices of outrage!

                              ANDREW
                    Your Honor, I submit there were
                    no complaints until Counselor
                    began knocking on doors,
                    drumming up business. And the
                    dust, which Counselor refers to,
                    has appeared on only three
                    occasions. Each time it has
                    been examined and the results...

Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs
a document into Andrew's hand.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.

Andrew submits the report to the Judge.

                              JOE
                    Innocuous?

                              ANDREW
                    Defined by Webster's as harmless.

                              JOE
                    I know what it means. Your
                    Honor, imagine how the children
                    in this neighborhood have been
                    made to feel. The pounding of
                    construction ringing in their
                    ears as this skyscraper, a
                    tribute to mankind's greed,
                    grows daily, casting an ominous
                    shadow over their lives, filling
                    them with dread even as they are
                    surrounded in a black, toxic
                    fog, blocking out the sun while
                    poisoning their lungs! And
                    Counselor calls it harmless?!

His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to
Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:

                              ANDREW
                    Your Honor, Counselor is
                    attempting to portray my client
                    as a hideous manifestation of
                    evil and corruption. But
                    nothing could be further from
                    the truth. Rockwell has
                    generously contributed ten
                    thousand dollars to this
                    neighborhood's schools, clinics
                    and youth centers! Granting a
                    restraining order on the
                    construction site will throw
                    hundreds of Philadelphians out
                    of work, and will lend
                    validation to this contemptible
                    and groundless nuisance suit,
                    which speaks directly to the
                    kind of greed and treachery that
                    today is threatening the very
                    fabric of our society.

Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.

                              JUDGE TATE
                    Let's not go off the deep end,
                    gentlemen. I thought we were
                    talking about some dust.

                                                  CUT TO:

A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS
joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ...

As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro-
cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite
corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing.

               ANDREW                      JOE
     ... plaintiff seeks to re-     ... whereas decedent had
     strain defendants from con-    pre-existing asthmatic
     tinued improper use of trade   condition and ride on
     name without...                Ultra Loop caused sub-
                                    sequent death...

Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other...

And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.

               ANDREW (CONT.)              JOE (CONT.)
     ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks
     authorization...               relief...

There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their
portable telephones at the same time.

They look at each other: which phone is ringing?

                              ANDREW
                    You.

Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.

                              JOE
                    Right.
                         (into phone)
                    Miller.

The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON
CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:

                              ANDREW
                    Client of yours?

                              JOE
                    Funny.

Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then
pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with
PEDESTRIANS (EXT./DAY) ...

... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.

                                                  CUT TO:

THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET,
Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase
(EXT./DAY) ...

RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal
Medicine."

Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to
the inside of his elbow.

                                                  CUT TO:

CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS
(MOSTLY YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS
DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms
extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK
PHYSICIAN'S AID.

CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running
into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of
the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most
of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.

DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although
MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).

                              TYRONE
                         (slapping a thin
                         PATIENT'S wrist)
                    Gonna have to start looking for
                    veins in your feet, sweetheart.

DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:

                              DR. GILLMAN
                    Andy. Can you stop at my office
                    on your way out?

                              ANDREW
                    Sure.

Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room,
rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands,
face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.

Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the
CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW HURRIES OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HAILING A CAB
(EXT./DAY) ...

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW HOPS OUT OF THE CAB, IN FRONT OF AN IMPRESSIVE
skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the work day
(EXT./DAY) ...

Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush "Wheeler
Building," pressing through the tide of WORKERS headed home.

                                                  CUT TO:

A BLACK PARALEGAL, ANTHEA BURTON, LEADS A YOUNG, BLACK LAW
CLERK (in suit and tie) to the elevators, at the sedate,
expensively appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman
Tetlow and Brown (INT./DAY) ...

                              ANTHEA
                    ... up to Tax, on fourteen, and
                    get right back, I need you.

Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four-
star smile. They stride down the corridor together.

                              ANDREW
                    Just the dazzling paralegal I
                    wanted to see.

                              ANTHEA
                         (friendly)
                    I know what that means, and the
                    answer is no. I have a class
                    tonight. Exploit someone else.
                    And since you've asked ...

They pass a silver-haired partner, KENNETH KILLCOYNE.

                              KILLCOYNE
                    Solid work on the Rockwell
                    situation, Andy. Top-notch.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks, Kenneth.
                         (to Anthea)
                    Your exam!

                              ANTHEA
                    Thank you. 98. I gotta go...

                              ANDREW
                    Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!

Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful
secretary, SHELBY, shoves documents at him.

                              SHELBY
                    Conference call's up. They just
                    started the roll call. Here's
                    the settlement agreement, the
                    red-lined copy's on your desk.
                    Need me in there?

                              ANDREW
                    No. Great. Thanks, Shelby.
                         (checking his watch)
                    It's 6:30, go home.

Andrew passes a colleague on her way out, RACHEL SMILOW:

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Rach.

                              RACHEL
                    I'm late, I have to pick up Amy
                    from her afterschool but I want
                    to talk to you about that Hansen
                    thing.

                              ANDREW
                    Catch me later, I'll be here.
                    And tell Amy, I love her
                    painting, it's on my wall.

Andrew SAILS toward his office.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

ANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY).

... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them.

... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall.

... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk.

The SCREEN SPLITS, REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR:

                              OPERATOR
                    ... Karen Hargreave, representing
                    Lloyd Management Corporation?

The SCREEN SPLITS INTO THIRDS: Andrew, the OPERATOR, and
HARGREAVE (a sharp, California lawyer.)

                              HARGREAVE
                    Present.

As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN
CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF
LAWYERS in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES)
saying "Present" while in Andrew's section of the screen...

... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line,

                              OPERATOR
                    Andrew Beckett, representing
                    Saunders International?

Andrew punches into the conference call

                              ANDREW
                    Present.

The MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a
suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden,
answering a portable phone.

                              SARAH
                    Hello?

                              ANDREW
                    Hi, Mom. It's me.

The LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of
the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's
conversation with his mother).

                              SARAH
                    Andy! This is a nice surprise.
                    How are you, hon?

                              ANDREW
                    I'm fine.

                              SARAH
                    What's Dr. Gillman say?

                              ANDREW
                    Hold on, Mom.
                         (punching into the
                         conference call)
                    There's no way my client will go
                    along with that.

                              HARGREAVE
                    Who's this?

                              ANDREW
                    Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm
                    sorry I interrupted...

He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing
over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut).

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Gillman says I'm fine. My blood
                    work is excellent. T-cells are up.
                    Just a sec ...
                         (conference call)
                    Yes, I think that would alleviate
                    most of our concerns.
                         (back to Mom)
                    My platelets look good too.

                              SARAH
                    Are you on one of those conference
                    calls? I hate when you put me on
                    hold.

                              CUT ON ANDREW'S LAUGHTER TO:

THE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.)

TITLE: "One-thirty a.m."

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ...

Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.

Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from
the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of
Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a
computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather
than a book.)

Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a
relevant citation:

                              ANDREW
                    Ah hah! Yes!
                         (chewing a string bean)
                    Rentworth v. Pennsylvania...

                    award of punitive damages for
                    wrongful interference with
                    prospective economic
                    relations...

A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.

ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:

                              KENTON
                    Look at this fucking guy. He's
                    an animal.

Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.

                              ANDREW
                    Walter.

The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible
This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Are we interrupting, Andy?

                              ANDREW
                    In a word, Bob...

                              SEIDMAN
                    Charles is right behind me.

ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a
horror-film feeling to it.

Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.

                              ANDREW
                    I was just about to take a
                    break. Good evening, Charles.

CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.

                              WHEELER
                    Andy? Could you step into my
                    office for a sec?
                         (deadpan)
                    I feel like firing someone
                    tonight.

Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.

                              ANDREW
                    We're gonna miss you around
                    here, Bob...

                                        CUT ON LAUGHTER TO:

THE RECEPTION AREA (INT./NIGHT): A DOMINO'S PIZZA DELIVERY
MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on
Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS...

Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide,
carpeted staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone
LAUGHS...

                                                  CUT TO:

A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INT./NIGHT) ...

                              SEIDMAN
                    Andy's expressed a keen interest
                    in the Kronos Inc. situation,
                    Charles. Is that correct, Andy?

The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with
its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.

                              ANDREW
                    The fate of the participants
                    interests me, yes sir.

Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of
preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass
clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the
cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.

Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches
with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.

Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter.
He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.

                              KENTON
                    It's good to be King, hey
                    Charles?

                              WHEELER
                    Kings are out of fashion. I'd
                    rather be thought of as a
                    benevolent tyrant.
                         (prompting Andrew)
                    It's an anti-trust action.

                              ANDREW
                    It is, and it isn't, Charles.
                    Macrosystem's new software
                    copies all the best-known
                    elements of Kronos' spreadsheet
                    program. If they're allowed to
                    sell it, Kronos will get undersold
                    right out of business. For me, the
                    legal principle, involved is
                    copyright infringement.

                              WHEELER
                    Bearing in mind that Bill
                    Wright, the chairman of
                    MacroSystems, is a close, personal
                    friend of mine... which side of
                    this mess would you desire to be
                    on, Andy? And don't allow my very
                    tight, personal relationship with
                    Bill to influence your answer in
                    any way.

Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.

                              ANDREW
                    Sorry, Charles, but...

Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    I'd like to see Kronos win.

Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS
ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: a faint purple blotch
about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw
on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.

                              KENTON
                    Why, Beckett?

                              ANDREW
                    Because they deserve to, Walter.

Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed
back, revealing the blotch.

He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to
cover the blotch.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    If MacroSystems wins, an energetic,
                    young company will be destroyed,
                    five thousand Americans will be
                    out of work. Moreover, the laws of
                    copyright and anti-trust were
                    enacted to prevent exactly the
                    kind of bullshit Macrosystems is
                    trying to pull.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Andy, do you know who reps Kronos
                    Inc.?

                              ANDREW
                    Bailey, Brackman.

                              WHEELER
                    Get with the program, Andy. As
                    of this evening, about 8:05 this
                    evening, right after the soup
                    course... Kronos Incorporated is
                    represented by Wyant Wheeler
                    Hellerman Tetlow and Brown. Or,
                    more specifically, senior
                    associate Andrew Beckett.

A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist
in a victory salute.

                              ANDREW
                    Yes!

                              SEIDMAN
                    You'll have to get right on it,
                    Andy, we're up against the
                    statute of limitations.

An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.

                              ASSOCIATE LAWYER
                    Tokyo on four, Bob.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Great. Excuse me, fellas.
                         (picking up a phone,
                         speaking Japanese)
                    Connichiwa. Itsumo osewa ni nari
                    mashita. Arigato gozaimasu.

Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks, Walter.

                              KENTON
                    What's that on your forehead,
                    pal?

                              ANDREW
                    Whacked with a racquetball.
                         (taking Wheeler's hand)
                    I appreciate your faith in my
                    abilities.

                              WHEELER
                    Faith, Andy, is the belief in
                    something for which we have no
                    evidence. It doesn't apply to
                    this situation.
                         (slapping his shoulder)
                    Go home. I mean, get back to
                    work.

Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.

                              ANDREW
                         (warmly, softly)
                    Thanks, Charles.

                              WHEELER
                         (with a father's
                         affection)
                    No sweat, buddy.

Smiling, Andrew exits the office.

CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING...

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

ANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS
away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then...

... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way
football players do when then score a touch down, saying
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" to himself, soundlessly.

The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a
maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his
little dance and starts to laugh.

Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS
at Helena and says:

                              ANDREW
                         (in a funny, kind of
                         medieval way)
                    It's good to be King.

                                                  CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY)

TITLE: "Ten days later."

                                                  CUT TO:

CLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN
Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY) 

It's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a
dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful.

A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's
face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend
CHANDRA.

                              CHANDRA (O.S.)
                    You want to apply the foundation
                    as evenly as you can, Andy. You
                    don't want to look like you've
                    thrown it on with a spoon.

                              ANDREW (O.S.)
                    Uh huh.

CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his
loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup.
Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend
named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's
command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend,
BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.

                              CHANDRA
                    Okay. You try.

Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.

                              ANDREW
                    Chandra? Don't you think this
                    color's a little... orange for me?

                              CHANDRA
                    Tahitian Bronze works best on
                    lesions.

                              ALAN
                    Think of it as the "I just back
                    from Aruba" look.

IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in
Andrew's "work area": desk, personal computer, etc.).

                              BRUNO
                    I got it.

Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to
Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.

                              ANDREW
                         (giving the fax
                         a quick scan)
                    Thanks, Bruno.
                         (to Alan and Chandra)
                    I've been out of the office four
                    days. I don't want them to
                    think I've been to the beach.
                         (searching for something)
                    Okay. Check this out.

Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell
frames, meant to help conceal the blotches.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Hides everything, right? What
                    do you think?

                              CHANDRA
                    You know who you look like,
                    Andy? That actor, in that
                    movie. Not the one where he was
                    autistic, the one where he
                    dressed up like a lady on a soap
                    opera...

                              ALAN
                    Dustin Hoffman.

                              ANDREW
                         (horrified)
                    Tootsie!

                              BRUNO
                    Right.

                              CHANDRA
                    You want to try Light Egyptian?

Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.

                              CHANDRA (CONT.)
                    What?

                              ANDREW
                         (clearly in pain)
                    Excuse me a sec...

Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.

                              CHANDRA
                    Just like my cousin Fredo.

CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR
slamming shut.

Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom
door.

                              BRUNO
                    You okay, Andy?

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

TIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his
face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping
it's over for now.

                              ANDREW
                    I think I need to go to the
                    hospital.

                                                  CUT TO:

MIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING
traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson
Hospital (EXT./DAY). He hustles up the ramp toward the
Emergency Entrance...

                                                  CUT TO:

MIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING
Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING 

ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against
his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over
his shoulders, fighting chills.

Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange
quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and
goodbyes.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks, you guys.

                              MIGUEL
                    Yeah. Thanks, guys.

Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.

                              ANDREW
                    Gillman's out of her office today.
                    I told her to take a day off, and
                    she did, can you believe it? Did
                    you get someone to cover your
                    class?

Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.

                              MIGUEL
                    Don't worry about it. They took
                    blood? A specimen?

Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.

                              ANDREW
                    Aren't you giving an exam?

                              MIGUEL
                    I said, don't worry about it.

Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.

                              MIGUEL (CONT.)
                    You got a fever, baby.

Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.

                              ANDREW
                    I almost didn't make it to
                    the bathroom, Miguel. I almost
                    lost control right in front
                    of everybody.

                              MIGUEL
                         (holding him)
                    So what? It's nothing to be
                    ashamed of. You have nothing to
                    be ashamed of, okay?

Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in
control of his emotions once more.

                              ANDREW
                    Wait, here's my guy... Hey!

Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose
surgeon's greens are covered with blood.

                              INTERN
                    Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...

                              ANDREW
                    About my blood work?

                              INTERN
                    We're waiting...

Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.

                              INTERN
                    ... meanwhile, I'd like to
                    prepare you for a colonoscopy,
                    so we can take a look inside.

                              ANDREW
                    Sounds delightful.

                              MIGUEL
                    Why do you need to do this?

                              INTERN
                    Who are you?

                              MIGUEL
                    Who are you? Doctor... ?

                              ANDREW
                    This is my partner. We keep
                    records of hospital visits.
                    Nothing personal.

                              INTERN
                    Dr. Klenstein.
                         (to Andrew)
                    It's not a pleasant procedure,
                    but if the KS is causing the
                    diarrhea, we ought to know right
                    away.

                              MIGUEL
                    It could be parasites, an
                    infection...

                              ANDREW
                    A reaction to AZT...

                              KLENSTEIN
                    That's possible, but.

                              MIGUEL
                    He's not going through some
                    painful procedure until we've
                    cancelled out everything else.

                              INTERN
                    I'm trying to help your
                    "partner." You're not a member
                    of his immediate family, I could
                    have you removed from the ER.

                              ANDREW
                         (to the Intern)
                    He's upset, he's sorry.

                              MIGUEL
                    Don't apologize for me.

                              ANDREW
                    He's not sorry, okay, fine.
                         (the diplomat)
                    Why don't we see what we find
                    out from the blood work? I'll
                    work on getting a specimen, I'm
                    sure hospital food could help in
                    that direction. Maybe, by then,
                    we'll hear from my doctor, and
                    we'll go from there. Okay?
                    Everybody happy?

                              INTERN
                    Allright. I'll get on the lab
                    about the blood work.

                              MIGUEL
                         (to the Intern)
                    I'm sorry.

The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS.

                              ANDREW
                    That's the third time. I better
                    call the office.
                         (smiling at Niguel)
                    Would you relax, please?

                              MIGUEL
                    I am relaxed.

Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE,
where weary relatives are watching TV.

Andrew drops a quarter into the phone.

                              JOE MILLER'S VOICE
                    "If you or someone you know..."

ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the
words "Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents"... and in
the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    "... has been injured through
                    the fault of others, you may be
                    entitled to legal remedy...

Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered:

                              ANDREW
                    Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been
                    beeping me, I... Okay, okay,
                    calm down. Put Jamey on.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK
(INT/DAY), GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES...

                              JAMEY
                         (frantic)
                    Andy?! This is a disaster! We
                    can't find your revisions on
                    the Kronos complaint!

                              ANDREW
                    Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's
                    sake!

                              JAMEY
                    I went down to Word Processing
                    to pick up the corrected copy,
                    but they said you haven't
                    delivered the corrections.
                    I told them you've been working on
                    it at home, and...

Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important.

                              ANDREW
                    I brought it in last night, around
                    midnight. It's in my computer.

                              JAMEY
                    What did you file it under?

Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard.

                              ANDREW
                    K-R-O-one.

Jamey types the file name.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Jamey, I don't have to mention,
                    do I, that we're up against a
                    statute of limitations on this
                    complaint which runs out in...
                         (checks his watch)
                    Seventy-five minutes.

Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor.

                              JAMEY
                    It's not here, Andy.

Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this.

                              ANDREW
                    You go down to Word Processing
                    and tell those motherfuckers
                    they better come up with that
                    complaint, now! Or they are
                    fucking dead! You tell them that
                    comes from me!

Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle.

He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself:

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Every problem has a solution.
                    Every problem... has... a...
                    solution.

Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Every problem has a solution...

Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen.

                              MIGUEL
                    Why are you getting dressed?

                              ANDREW
                    You're not going to like this.
                    Please try to smile...

Andrew puts his arms around Miguel.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Thanks for leaving school, and
                    coming here, and...
                         (pulling back, putting
                         on his jacket)
                    I will be back. An hour, tops.

                              MIGUEL
                    You're going to the office?!

                              ANDREW
                    You're not smiling.

Andrew rushes toward the exit doors.

                              MIGUEL
                    You're leaving the hospital?
                    You're going into the office
                    looking like that? Are you
                    insane?

                              ANDREW
                    One hour!

                              MIGUEL
                    Drew!

                              ANDREW
                    I promise!

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

ANDREW RUSHES TO THE STREET, HAILING A CAB (EXT./DAY) ...

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW STEPS OUT OF THE TAXI IN FRONT OF THE WHEELER
Building, heading for the entrance (EXT./DAY) ...

But he changes his mind, darting to the corner of the block.

Andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a VENDOR.

He trots down an alley, past bags of garbage, entering the
building through a garage door.

                                                  CUT TO:

FROM A HIGH FLOOR, ANDREW CAN BE SEEN CLIMBING THE STEPS OF
an emergency stairwell (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew passes CAMERA, out of breath. He's wearing the ball cap
PULLED TO HIS EYEBROWS to hide blotches on his forehead.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW OPENS THE FIRE DOOR ON HIS FLOOR AT WYANT WHEELER, removing
the ball cap, baring the purple blotches. (INT./DAY)

He walks quickly down the hall. Passing a COLLEAGUE, Andrew
pretends to scratch his face, attempting to hide the blotches
as nonchalantly as possible.

He dashes past an office, ignoring Anthea.

                              ANTHEA
                    Didn't expect to see you... ?

He ducks into his office.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

SECRETARY SHELBY AT ANDREW'S DESK, FRANTICALLY SEARCHING
through papers (INT./DAY) ...

Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall.

                              SHELBY
                    I'm looking through the files but...

                              ANDREW
                    Call the messenger service, have
                    someone standing by...
                         (she reaches for the phone)
                    Your phone.

                              SHELBY
                    Sure.

Andrew keeps his face averted, until she's out of the room. He
goes to his computer, the monitor already glowing.

                              ANDREW
                    Think. You brought the discs in, you
                    transferred...

Rachel comes into his office.

                              RACHEL
                    I thought I was supposed to be
                    covering for you.
                         (blurts out)
                    God, Andy, you look awful.

                              ANDREW
                    Fucking Word Processing lost my
                    Kronos complaint. Which must be
                    filed by fucking five o'clock!
                    If it's late, there's no case...
                         (the mantra)
                    Every problem has a solution.

                              RACHEL
                    What can I do?

                              ANDREW
                    Get down to Word Processing.
                    Help Jamey look.

She rushes out.

Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his
computer, bringing up each disc's directory.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    No.

He throws the disc to the floor. Shoves in another.

Shoves in another, bending it in half.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    No, goddammit!

He pulls open a file drawer, dumping legal briefs onto the
floor, frantically spreading them around with his foot.

Andrew THROWS a document across the room, takes a breath.

He picks up the telephone.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Bob? Something's come up. With
                    Kronos. I don't want to
                    upset Charles, but...
                         (letting down his guard)
                    Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint's
                    due in forty minutes and I can't
                    find it.
                         (suddenly)
                    No, you don't have to come...
                         (hanging up the phone)
                    Great. Fucking great.

Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare.

He switches off the overhead light. He slants the window
blinds, filling the room with shadow

Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful.

                              SEIDMAN
                    C'mon, Andy, you didn't lose
                    anything...

Seidman is struck by the mess in the office, and Andrew's
disheveled appearance.

                              SEIDMAN (CONT.)
                    Jesus.

                              ANDREW
                    I don't know what to do, Bob.

                              SEIDMAN
                    You'll never find it in the dark.

Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches.

Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the
purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on.

                              SEIDMAN (CONT.)
                    What in God's name... ?

                              ANDREW
                    Bob...

                              SEIDMAN
                    What's wrong with your face?

                              ANDREW
                    What's wrong with my face? You
                    want to know what's wrong with
                    my face? I've got a skin
                    condition. Next question, Bob?
                    No more questions? Fine. Now
                    can you help me find the complaint?

                              SEIDMAN
                    Allright. Calm down.

                              ANDREW
                    Sorry...

Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer.

                              SEIDMAN
                    What was the file name?

                              ANDREW
                    K-R-O-one.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Maybe you mistyped the name when
                    you were saving it. We'll try
                    combinations of those letters...

Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder.

                              ANDREW
                    You're right, I probably just
                    misfiled...

                              KENTON (O.S.)
                    Andy?

Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is
casual. So casual it seems a little forced.

                              KENTON (CONT.)
                    Some sort of problem?

Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY
TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton.

                              ANDREW
                    Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of
                    major problem.

HOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW...

SOUND OF A BABY CRYING CROSSES THE CUT TO:

A NEWBORN BEING LIFTED INTO A DOCTOR'S HANDS (INT./DAY) ...

                              DOCTOR
                    There she is, okay. You can relax
                    now, Lisa.

LISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She
collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in
pain, quietly crying a little.

TITLE: "One month later."

The NURSES and the (FEMALE) DOCTOR move professionally
around the bed, doing their jobs.

At Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting
amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby.

                              JOE
                    Oh my god... a girl... oh my
                    god... Lisa... oh my god...

He's frantic.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    You load the film... ? No, on
                    this side... or this side?
                    Don't move the baby!

                              LISA
                    Give me the camera, Joe.

Lisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back.

                              JOE
                    Thanks, hon. Oh my god...

With wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Oh my god... oh my god, look at
                    her... oh my god...

Passing a PATIENT IN TRACTION, ROLLING BY ON A GURNEY, Joe
drops a business card into the PATIENT'S broken hand.

                         (to the PATIENT)

                    Get everything over here as soon
                    as you can, she's starved. No,
                    not the baby! Lisa! ... Iris,

                    about? ... Uh huh... Uh huh...

Turning a corner, Joe comes face to face with HIS RELATIVES,
who charge at him joyfully:

                              JOE'S MOTHER/AUNTS/UNCLES, ETC.
                    Congratulations! How is Lisa?!
                    When can we see the baby?!

A FEMALE CLIENT (MRS. FINLEY) faces Joe, her arm in a sling.

                    Right.

A MAN WEARING A NECKBRACE, sitting next to Andrew, RISES,
MOVING to a seat opposite Andrew. From this new position the
MAN WITH THE NECKBRACE STARES at Andrew.

MAN WITH NECKBRACE'S POV:

The PURPLE BLOTCHES on Andrew's face are beginning,to recede,
not as angry looking as before, thanks to chemo therapy.
Andrew is dressed casually, in jeans and a softball jacket
(from the Wyant Wheeler team) with "Andy" embroidered over the
heart.

Joe's assistant, IRIS, approaches.

                              IRIS
                    Mr. Beckett?

Andrew rises, following Iris past office dividers, HARRIED
SECRETARIES and overflowing file cabinets.

Iris cannot look at Andrew as she walks beside him.

written by hand.)

                    Explain this to me like I'm a
                    six year old, okay? The entire
                    street is clear except for one
                    small area under construction,
                    with a huge hole that is clearly
                    marked and blocked off, and you
                    decide you must cross the street
                    at this spot. You fall into the
                    hole and you want to sue the
                    city for negligence? ...

                              MRS. FINLEY
                    Yeah. Do I have a case?

                              JOE
                    Of course you have a case! Now,
                    I want you to go with my
                    assistant, Iris, and fill out
                    some forms. She'll tell you
                    about our fee arrangement.

                    Mrs. Finley? Any back pain
                    since the accident? Dizziness?
                    Nightmares?

                              MRS. FINLEY
                    Now that you mention it...

                              JOE
                    Tell Iris all about it.
                         (leading her out)
                    Take good care of Mrs. Finley,

                    Beckett, come in.

Joe offers his hand, getting a look at Andrew's face.

                    Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

                              ANDREW
                    I have AIDS.

Joe WITHDRAWS his hand, before it touches Andrew's.

                              JOE
                    Whoa-oh!
                         (beat)
                    Sorry, I...

                              JOE
                    Uh, yeah.

Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Go ahead.

Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself
acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.)

                    Kids are great.

                    Thanks, Beckett. I'm real

                    I misplaced an important
                    complaint. That's their story.
                    Want to hear mine?

                    I was diagnosed with AIDS eight
                    months ago. During a bout of
                    pneumonia. I recovered quickly
                    and was back at work in ten
                    days. Since I was doing so well
                    on the AZT, we decided against
                    telling anyone about it.

                              JOE
                    We?

                    I dove back into work,
                    everything was fine. Until the

                    face. For a short period, I
                    avoided the office during the
                    day, waiting for the chemo
                    therapy to clear up the
                    lesions...

                    I made all my calls from home.
                    I worked sixteen hour days on a

                    due, it disappeared. Erased

                    to the office for a meeting with
                    the managing partners. Walking
                    down that corridor was strange.
                    Felt like everyone was staring.

REVERSE ANGLE ON ANDREW AND JOE WALKING AT ANDREW'S SIDE.

                              JOE
                    Hell, they are staring. What's
                    that shit on your face?

                              ANDREW
                    Makeup.

ANDREW'S POV: RACHEL OUTSIDE HER OFFICE, SAYS "GOOD LUCK."

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    The partners were waiting for me
                    in the main conference room.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM, GIVING US ANDREW'S
POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne,
Bob Seidman are waiting (INT./DAY) ...

                              WHEELER
                    Sit down, Andy.

Wheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes.

                              WHEELER (CONT.)
                    Thanks for coming in.

                              ANDREW
                    Of course.

Bob Seidman CANNOT look directly at Andrew.

                              WHEELER
                    Andy. Before we begin, I'd just
                    like to say: everyone in this
                    room is your friend.

                              JOE
                    You're in trouble.

(NOTE: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A
WINDOW IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks.)

                              ANDREW
                    I know that, Charles.

                              WHEELER
                    More than your friend. Family.

                              JOE
                    Big trouble.

                              ANDREW
                    Charles, I must apologize again,
                    for the Kronos mishap.
                         (smiling)
                    It was a scary few minutes
                    around here. Wow. But thank
                    God, the complaint was found.
                    And no damage was done.

                              KENTON
                    This time. What about next time?

                              ANDREW
                    There won't be a next time, I
                    guarantee it.

                              WHEELER
                    Andy. It seems that something
                    has come over you, lately: A
                    kind of... stupor, a fogginess,
                    a lack of focus... Earth to
                    Andy. Anybody home?

                              KENTON
                    Helloooo...

                              KILLCOYNE
                    That's right, Andy. The last
                    four, five months you've seemed
                    really out of it...

                              SEIDMAN
                    At least... different, somehow.

                              ANDREW
                         (keeping it positive)
                    Perhaps... you're right. I've
                    certainly been busy. With the
                    Kronos complaint, a preliminary
                    injunction hearing and the
                    Saunders trial all falling at the
                    same time...

                              KENTON
                    Some people think you have an
                    attitude problem, Beckett.

                              ANDREW
                    Really? Who thinks that, sir?

                              WHEELER
                    I do.

Wheeler seems very grave.

                              ANDREW
                    I had no idea there was a concern
                    in that area. Hey:
                         (a smile)
                    I'll get to work on it right away.

NO ONE else smiles.

                              WHEELER
                    We've been talking it over, Andy.
                    Your future that is... We feel that,
                    because we respect you so much, we
                    have to be honest with you.

                              ANDREW
                    Honesty is always best.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Do you really think so, Andy?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes, Bob, I do.
                         (to the group)
                    Excuse me? Am I being fired?

                              WHEELER
                    Let's put it this way, Andy:
                    your place in the future of this
                    firm is no longer secure.

                              JOE
                    In a word, yes.

                              WHEELER
                    We don't think it's fair to keep
                    you here, where your future is
                    limited. But we wish you luck,
                    Andy, all the luck in the world.

Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.

                              WHEELER (CONT.)
                    And I hate to rush you out of
                    here, but...

                              JOE
                    But he's got lots of other
                    people's lives to ruin...

                              WHEELER
                    ... we've got a committee meeting.

                              ANDREW
                    Excuse me, Charles. With all
                    due respect... this is...
                    preposterous! It doesn't make
                    any sense, it sounds as if we're
                    talking about someone else.
                    Pardon the lack of humility, but
                    I've had the distinct impression
                    I was kind of... one of the
                    rising stars around here. And I
                    feel that wasn't just my
                    imagination. And I also think I
                    deserve to know what's really
                    going on here, Charles.

                              KENTON
                    Oh, you're right, Beckett, you
                    don't have an attitude problem.

                              WHEELER
                    Take it easy, Walter.

                              ANDREW
                    If you'd lost confidence in me,
                    why did you give me the Kronos suit?

                              WHEELER
                    I hoped the challenge would
                    improve your performance. You
                    could say it was a carrot.

                              ANDREW
                    A carrot?!

                              JOE
                    I buy that.

                              ANDREW
                    As in, the vegetable?

                              SEIDMAN
                         (suddenly emotional)
                    Andy, you nearly blew the case,
                    for God's sake! That alone is
                    inexcusable. It would have been
                    catastrophic for us. Put
                    yourself in our shoes, Andy.
                    There's no coming back from an
                    error like that, regardless of
                    who you are!
                         (softer)
                    I'm sorry, Andy.

Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting
home. He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...

                              ANDREW
                    Uh huh... Okay... I see...

... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia,
whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone
to say something.

Wheeler breaks the silence.

                              WHEELER
                    Good luck, Andy.

Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out.

Andrew doesn't move.

A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.

                              ANDREW
                    Who are you?

                              SECURITY GUARD
                    I'm here to escort you to your
                    office so you can organize your
                    belongings.

                                                  CUT TO:

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ...

                              JOE
                    Okay. Explain to me like I'm a
                    two year old, because there's an
                    element to this I can't get
                    through my thick head: Didn't
                    you have an obligation to inform
                    your employer you had this
                    dreaded, deadly, infectious
                    disease?

Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to
disguise the effects of chemo.

                              ANDREW
                    The law says people with
                    disabilities cannot be
                    terminated, so long as they can
                    perform the duties required by
                    their position...

                              JOE
                    Okay, okay... They discover you
                    have this horrible, disgusting,
                    terminal illness, and they
                    panic, for any number of
                    perfectly valid reasons.
                    They're frightened for
                    themselves, their families...
                    Maybe it's the homo angle.
                    Maybe they don't want to rub
                    elbows with someone who's just
                    popped out of the closet with a
                    terminal case of acne. And how
                    do they explain your status to
                    the client for Chrissake?

                              ANDREW
                    Joe, from the day I arrived to
                    the day they fired me, I
                    performed consistently,
                    thoroughly and with absolute
                    excellence. And if they hadn't
                    fired me, that's what I'd be
                    doing today.


                              JOE
                    Okay... They want you out. It's
                    against the law to fire you for
                    having AIDS, so they make you
                    look like a fuck up. Which
                    leads us to the mysterious, lost
                    file.

                              ANDREW
                    They sabotaged me.

                              JOE
                    I knew you were going to say
                    that. I don't buy it, and I
                    don't see a case.

                              ANDREW
                    Look. I know I have a case. If
                    you don't want to take it for
                    personal reasons...

                              JOE
                    Correct. I don't.

Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks for your time.

                              JOE
                    Beckett? I'm sorry about...
                    what's happened to you. It's a
                    fucking kick in the head.

                              ANDREW
                         (a smile)
                    Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm
                    not dead yet.

Andrew exits.

Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler
named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY.

Joe approaches Iris's desk.

                              JOE

Joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table.

                    Wait. I know the answer. Only sex,
                    or sharing needles. I know that.
                    We didn't shake hands, anyway.

Dr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump,

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    The HIV virus can only be transmitted
                    through the exchange of bodily
                    fluids, namely blood and semen.

                              JOE
                    Right.

Joe begins rolling down his sleeve.

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Leave that.

                              JOE
                    Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they
                    keep finding out new things about
                    this disease? So you tell me, today,
                    there's no danger, and I go home,
                    and I hold my baby, and six months
                    from now I hear on the news: "whoops!
                    We were wrong.' You can carry it on
                    your clothes, your skin, and now I've
                    got to worry about my kid. What
                    are you doing?

Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe.

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    We're going to draw blood.

                              JOE
                    Why are we going to do that?

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Joe. I don't care a whit about your
                    private life.

                              JOE
                    You want to give me an AIDS test?!

Joe HOPS off the table.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    The guy sat in my office! You can't
                    get AIDS that way, right?

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Right.

                              JOE
                    It doesn't travel through the
                    air, by breathing, or touching,
                    right?

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Not by touching, or shaking hands,
                    or hugging, using the same toilet...
                    Even kissing someone with AIDS is
                    safe. But it there's something in
                    your past you're worried about...

                              JOE
                    Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an
                    AIDS test. Are you crazy? But
                    thanks for the information. Really.

Joe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK:

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    In my past?

                              ARMBRUSTER
                    IV drug use.

Joe shakes his head.

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER (CONT.)
                    A homosexual encounter.

                              JOE
                    Get real.

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Unprotected sex with a prostitute.

                              JOE
                         (thinking it over)
                    Uh.... No. Not really.

                              DR. ARMBRUSTER
                    Or unprotected sex with someone you
                    didn't know very well, any time
                    during the last twelve years.

A MOMENT.

Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve.

                                                  CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING: JOE'S HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS (EXT./NIGHT) ...

                              LISA (VOICE OVER)
                    You have a problem with gays,
                    Joe.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOB CRADLES HIS BABY AGAINST HIS CHEST (INT./NIGHT) ...

                              JOE
                    Not especially.

Lisa eats standing up, at the stove, while Joe walks the
BABY in their modern kitchen.

                              LISA
                    How many gays do you know?

                              JOE
                    How many do you know?

                              LISA
                    Lots.

                              JOE
                    Who?

                              LISA
                    Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My
                    cousin Tommy who lives in
                    Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the
                    office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of
                    the partners. His lover, Greg.
                    Stanley, the guy who's putting in
                    our kitchen cabinets.

For a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says:

                              JOE
                    Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That
                    beautiful, sensuous woman is a...
                    lesbian?

                              LISA
                    Duh...

                              JOE
                    Since when?

                              LISA
                    Probably since she was born.

                              JOE
                    Allright. I admit it: I'm
                    prejudiced. I don't want to work
                    with a homosexual. You got me.

                              LISA
                    Okay, Joe...

                              JOE
                    I mean, two guys, doing the
                    horizontal thing? I don't get
                    it. Don't they get confused?
                    "Is that mine? I thought it was
                    yours." Hey, call me old
                    fashioned, call me
                    conservative... I think maybe
                    you have to be a man to get just
                    how nauseating the whole basic
                    idea really is.

                              LISA
                    Fine, Joe.

                              JOE
                    And the way they work out,
                    pumping up, so they can be macho
                    and faggot at the same time... I
                    can't stand that shit. Now I'm
                    being totally honest with you.

                              LISA
                    That's perfectly clear.

CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA:

                              JOE
                    Would you take a client if you
                    were constantly thinking: "I
                    hope this guy doesn't touch me.
                    I don't even want him to breathe
                    on me?"

                                                  CUT TO:

THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS
decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th
St. Deli, with a package (EXT./DAY) ...

TITLE: "Two weeks later."

                                                  CUT TO:

JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY
books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami
sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN
saunters by (INT./DAY) ...

A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:

Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been
reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew
removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a
package of tissues, blowing his nose.

                              JOE
                         (under his breath)
                    Shit...

Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or
eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.

JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS:

Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes
something. Sneezes.

A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.

                              LIBRARIAN
                    This is the supplement. You're
                    right, there is a section on...
                         (lowers her voice)
                    ... HIV related discrimination.

                              ANDREW
                    Thank you.

Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.

                              LIBRARIAN
                    We have a private research room
                    available.

                              ANDREW
                    I'm fine, thanks.

Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.

                              LIBRARIAN
                    Wouldn't you be more comfortable in
                    a research room?

                              ANDREW
                         (pleasantly)
                    No. But would it make you more
                    comfortable?

                              LIBRARIAN
                    Whatever, sir.

The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating
she's done all she can do.

As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks
up his books and moves away.

Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye
on Andrew, who concentrates on his work.

Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be
sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.

                              JOE
                    Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?

                              ANDREW
                    Fine.

Andrew goes back to his work.

                              JOE
                    Who'd you get?

                              ANDREW
                    What?

                              JOE
                    Find a lawyer?

                              ANDREW
                    I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?

                              JOE
                    Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.

                              ANDREW
                    What's her name?

                              JOE
                    Rayisha.

                              ANDREW
                    Rayisha. Very nice.

Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away.

Joe comes back.

                              JOE
                    How did they find out?

                              ANDREW
                         (a second, then:)
                    One of the partners spotted a
                    lesion on my forehead.

Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she
hears the word "lesion."

                              JOE
                    Uh huh...

Andrew concentrates on his work once more.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    How do you get from one lawyer
                    spotting a lesion, which could
                    have been a bruise, to the
                    partners deducing you had AIDS
                    and basing a decision to
                    terminate you on that
                    conclusion?

The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.

                              ANDREW
                    Good point.

Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big
letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    The partner who spotted the
                    lesion, Walter Kenton, used to
                    work for Benton, Myers, in D.C.
                    There's a paralegal there, Maria
                    Torres. She's had lesions on
                    and off for three years. She
                    says it was common knowledge
                    around the office that her
                    lesions were caused by AIDS.

                              JOE
                    They didn't fire her?

                              ANDREW
                    No. They didn't fire her.

Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.

                              JOE
                    So Kenton connected the... lesion,
                    and whatever suspicions he had about
                    your personal life... to this
                    woman, Maria... and blew the
                    whistle on you. Suddenly you're
                    losing files, and it's time to
                    let you go. But, up to this
                    point, you've been their Golden
                    Boy, their rising star... Their
                    behavior is... inconsistent.

                              ANDREW
                    Thank you.

Andrew goes back to work.

                              JOE
                    There is no relevant precedent.

                              ANDREW
                         (not looking up)
                    Arline decision. Supreme Court.

                              JOE
                    Arline?

Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.

CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (with one blotch) on the book's white
pages.

The book is still facing Andrew. If Joe wants to read it,
he'll have to turn it around.

Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT.

Joe turns the book around, begins to read:

                              JOE
                    "The Federal Vocational
                    Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits
                    discrimination..."

CAMERA CRANES UP, TOWARD THE CEILING... JOE CONTINUES
READING IN VOICE-OVER:

                              JOE (VO) (CONT.)
                    "... against otherwise qualified
                    handicapped persons who are able
                    to perform the duties required by
                    their employment..."

CAMERA GOES HIGHER, LOOKING DOWN ON THE ROWS OF BOOKS AND THE
LONG TABLES DOTTED WITH PEOPLE...

                              JOE (VO) (CONT.)
                    "Although the ruling did not
                    address the specific issue of
                    HIV and AIDS discrimination..."

DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER: Andrew and Joe face each
other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table,
or at the table next to it...

                              ANDREW (VO)
                    "Subsequent decisions have held
                    that AIDS is protected as a
                    handicap under law, not only
                    because of the physical
                    limitations it imposes..."

DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO
NIGHT): Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the
library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe.

                              ANDREW (VO) (CONT.)
                    "But because the prejudice
                    surrounding AIDS exacts a social
                    death which precedes the actual,
                    physical one..."

DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER: Andrew and Joe sit on the
same side of the table, reading the same book.

                              JOE (VO)
                    "This is the essence of
                    discrimination: formulating
                    opinions about others not based
                    on their individual merits but,
                    rather, on their membership in a
                    group with assumed characteristics...

The library is QUIET. Andrew SNEEZES.

Joe scoots his chair away from Andrew by eight inches.

DISCO MUSIC RISES ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUNDS OF GRUNTING,
HEAVY BREATHING AND SLAPPING FLESH AS WE...

                                                  CUT TO:

MUSCULAR, SWEATY MALE BODIES SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, sounds of
GRUNTS, skin SLAPPING against skin (INT./NIGHT) ...

... Hand SLAPPING a butt under satin shorts

... Sweaty armpits... the ROAR OF A CROWD...

... BASKETBALL PLAYERS embracing, twirling each other around, high
fiving...

WIDE ANGLE REVEALS: A basketball game in progress, Sixers
versus the Celtics in Philly's Spectrum Arena.

ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TV: ROBERT PARISH going for a lay-up...

                              WHEELER/KENTON/OTHERS
                    Watch this guy! Nail him! Ouch!

Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman
and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush,
private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear
Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of
cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE.

Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby.
Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling
lovingly at the boy.

JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY
GUARD and a well-dressed, charismatic MAN looks in.

                              WHEELER
                         (spotting him)
                    Julius!

                              KENTON
                    Dr. J.!

                              DR. J.
                    Gentlemen... Ladies...

JULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS.

                              LAWYERS
                    How's it goin', Doctor?/This is
                    an honor!/etc ...

The door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING
Joe Miller (in jeans and basketball jacket) and a MARSHALL.

                              JOE
                    Excuse me. Charles Wheeler?

Wheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Summons. For you.

NOW the box is QUIET.

                              DR. J.
                    Say. What's up, Chuck?

                                                  CUT TO:

THE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM
Stadium (INT./NIGHT) where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman,
with Walter Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS
OF THE GAME STILL IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY.
Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY
SERVICE EMPLOYEES...

                              WHEELER
                    ... interview every employee,
                    support staff, associates, partners.
                    Did any of them know Andy was sick?
                    How did they know? Did he tell them?
                    Did they notice something was wrong
                    with his appearance? None of this
                    information got to the managing
                    partners. We know that. Make sure
                    everyone else does too... And
                    Beckett: I want to know everything
                    about his personal life. Did he
                    frequent those pathetic bars on
                    Camac Street?

                              SEIDMAN
                    Jesus.

                              WHEELER
                         (ignoring Seidman)
                    What about other homosexual
                    facilities, whatever they are?

                              SEIDMAN
                    Charles...

                              WHEELER
                    What deviant groups or
                    organizations did he secretly
                    belong to?
                         (with irritation)
                    What is it, Bob?!

                              SEIDMAN
                    Let's settle with Andy and put
                    this whole tragic mess behind
                    us.

They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac.

                              WHEELER
                    Andrew brought AIDS into our
                    offices, into our men's room.
                    He brought AIDS to our annual
                    goddamn family picnic.

                              KENTON
                    We ought to be suing him.

                              SEIDMAN
                    For Christ's sake, where's your
                    compassion?

                              KENTON
                    Compassion? Andy sucks cocks,
                    Bob. He takes it up the ass.
                    He's a pervert.

Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION.

                              SEIDMAN
                    That's kind of... extreme, Walt.
                    Andy's private life is none of
                    our business.

                              WHEELER
                    Bob. You're trying my patience.
                    Andrew Beckett is making his
                    private life our business. We
                    gave him Kronos. Did he say,
                    "I'm sick. I might not be able
                    to see this through?"

                              SEIDMAN
                    He was doing a great job.

                              WHEELER
                    Bob. I must ask you to shut the
                    fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say
                    "I might not be able to serve our
                    clients to the best of my ability?"
                    He said nothing. And now, Andrew
                    Beckett proposes to haul me into a
                    court of law, to sling accusations
                    at me, in full view of the entire,
                    Philadelphia, judicial
                    establishment. My God.

                              KILLCOYNE
                    Beckett doesn't want to go to court,
                    he's hoping for a quick tasty
                    settlement.

                              SEIDMAN
                    A jury might decide that Andy has a
                    case.

                              WHEELER
                    Wait a minute. The man was fired for
                    incompetence, not because he has
                    AIDS. You didn't know he was sick,
                    did you, Bob?

                              KENTON
                    Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?

                              SEIDMAN
                         (after a moment)
                    No. Not really.

Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne.

Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place.

                    CITY SOUNDS ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO:

EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ON A THURSDAY MORNING.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in
Joe's offices, INT./DAY):

                              FILKO
                    Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?!

Joe sweeps by, just arriving for work.

                              JOE
                    Morning, Filko.

Filko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER
COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes:

                              COLLEAGUE
                    Hey, it's the local chapter of
                    the ACLU!

                              FILKO
                    You're a Republican, Joe! You
                    belong to the NRA!

                              JOE
                    How many toilet stalls are there
                    in the women's restroom on this
                    floor, Filko?

                              FILKO
                    How many... what?!

Filko follows Joe into Joe's office.

                              JOE
                    Two. How many toilet stalls are
                    there in the men's room? Two,
                    plus four urinals. How many
                    wheelchair accessible toilets in
                    either of those restrooms?
                    Zero. In this entire building?
                    Zero. Get the picture, Filko?
                    Discrimination! You find
                    yourself a female, paraplegic,
                    legal assistant who is qualified
                    to work here, except she can't
                    take a leak... and you've got
                    yourself a sex discrimination
                    suit and a handicapped
                    discrimination suit. Not
                    handicapped. What do you call
                    someone who can't use a normal
                    restroom? "Gastro-intestinally
                    challenged!"

Behind Joe, out a large window: PAINTERS on a scaffold.

Iris comes into the office and says:

                              IRIS
                    Wyant Wheeler's asking for a
                    postponement on the prelim, Joe.

Joe is dialing the phone.

                              JOE
                    Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of
                    course they want a postponement,
                    I've got a client with a terminal
                    disease. They're going to drag
                    their heels every step of the way,
                    the rotten bastards.
                         (tapping on the window, to the
                         PAINTERS)
                    Is that spelled right?

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, WHERE PAINTERS ARE ADDING A new
question to the line of windows (DAY):

D I S C R I M I N A T E D A G A I N S T ?

                              JOE (VO)
                    Hey, Beckett. This is Miller.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOE'S VOICE COMES THROUGH, ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE IN
Andrew and Miguel's loft (INT./DAY) 

                              JOE (VO) (CONT.)
                    I just wanted to tell you...

CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH the loft, finding Andrew in the rooftop
solarium, sitting crosslegged in front of a candle.

                              JOE (VO) (CONT.)
                    ... we're trying to set a date for
                    the prelim. Hang in there.

Andrew's eyes are closed. Next to him rests a tape player. A
WOMAN'S VOICE IS HEARD, accompanied by NEW AGE MUSIC:

                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                    I can heal myself.

                              ANDREW
                    I can heal myself.

                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                    I can heal myself.

                              ANDREW
                    I can heal myself.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW AND MIGUEL IN THEIR BEDROOM AT NIGHT, LYING CLOSE TO
each other in bed (INT./NIGHT) ...

                              MIGUEL
                    I was coming out of the gym
                    today, and I ran into Jimmy. Do
                    you know what he asked me?
                    "What's it like knowing your
                    boyfriend's going to die?"

                              ANDREW
                    Jerk... What did you say?

                              MIGUEL
                    I said, "Everyone's going to
                    die, Jimmy. But Drew's not
                    going to die of AIDS. There's a
                    cure around the corner, and he
                    plans to be around to take
                    advantage of it."

Miguel strokes Andrew's hair.

                              ANDREW
                    You got that right, Mikey...
                         (beat)
                    You still believe that, don't
                    you?

                              MIGUEL
                    Yes. I think it will be a
                    simple solution. They'll put it
                    in a syringe, inject it into
                    your bloodstream. It'll
                    neutralize the virus. It'll
                    revitalize the immune system,
                    and people with AIDS will become
                    healthy again.

HOLD ON MIGUEL AND ANDREW, ON THIS QUIET MOMENT.

FADE OUT.

The figures APPROACHING CAMERA are Andrew and Joe, stepping

TITLE: "Pre-trial settlement conference."

REVERSE ANGLE -- DOWN AN OPPOSITE CORRIDOR:

A PHALANX OF LAWYERS -- at least ten -- APPROACHING CAMERA, a
bulwark of white shirts and dark ties.

ON ANDREW AND JOE:

Andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have
receded,his weight is up. He's in a stage of recovery.

ON THE OTHER LAWYERS:

Charles Wheeler (seeming ironic) and Walter Kenton (he's
pissed) lead the battalion.

Behind them, walk young lawyers BELINDA CONINE and JEROME
GREEN. Belinda is white, Jerome is black.

                                                  CUT TO:

HUSHED VOICES (INT./DAY) ...

A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a
loose circle, like a casual living room.

Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team
takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit
next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand.

Wheeler is looking across the room at...

Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.

                              WHEELER
                    You're looking better, Andy.
                    How do you feel?

SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.

                              ANDREW
                    Fine, thanks, Charles.

JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a
Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Charles, Walter...

                              WHEELER
                    Congratulations on the new
                    grandson.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Thank you. We're very happy.

The Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room
becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Attorney for the plaintiff?

                              JOE
                    Joseph Miller, Your Honor.
                    Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    I've seen your television commercials.
                    "If you or anyone you know has
                    been injured through the fault of
                    others... It should say, "through
                    the negligence of others."

                              JOE
                    I'll take that under consideration,
                    Your Honor.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    On behalf of the defendants?

                              BELINDA CONINE
                    Belinda Conine. Of Petersen,
                    Lehigh, Monroe and Smith.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    And Jerome Green.

And a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses:

                    Dexter Smith.

A white-haired lawyer next to Belinda:

                              RALPH PETERSEN
                    Ralph Petersen.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                         (to Joe)
                    You're outnumbered four to one.
                         (to the others)
                    Whom do I address?
                    I can't talk to four lawyers at
                    once.

                              BELINDA
                    I'm chief litigator, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Fine. I've asked the litigants to be
                    present for this conference, in the
                    hope we can settle this matter
                    today, among ourselves... There is
                    nothing I hate more, than to see
                    lawyers suing each other. If you
                    look at the opinion polls, when Mr.
                    John Q. Citizen is asked to rank
                    professions according to the
                    respect he holds for them... Where
                    are the lawyers? Somewhere below
                    personal fitness trainers and only
                    slightly above child pornographers.
                    If we keep suing each other, if we
                    fail to settle the smallest
                    difference among ourselves with
                    mutual respect, if we continue to
                    scrap like bucks in heat, we'll
                    fall lower on that list. And when
                    people lose respect for lawyers,
                    they lose respect for the law. And
                    when this society loses all respect
                    for the law, we'll be murdered in
                    our beds, my friends, our cherished
                    institutions will be burned to the
                    ground and our children and our
                    grandchildren will live like
                    savages.

                              JOE
                    If it please Your Honor, we hope to
                    settle this matter.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    By God you will settle it! If you
                    force this case to trial, young man,
                    you'll regret it for the rest of
                    your natural-born days...
                    Now, Joseph. What would you
                    require to settle this matter
                    today?

                              JOE
                    Reinstatement at full salary.
                    Back pay covering the period of
                    unemployment and...

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Hold it, Joe.
                         (to Wheeler)
                    He wants to come back to work,
                    Chuck.

                              WHEELER
                    That's impossible, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    That's impossible, Joe.

                              BELINDA CONINE
                    If it please Your Honor, we're
                    prepared to offer a cash
                    settlement of twenty-five
                    thousand dollars.

                              JOE
                    Your generosity overwhelms me,
                    Belinda, considering my client
                    was earning over a hundred thou
                    when he was terminated almost six
                    months ago.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut
                    through these false attitudes.
                    Give them a figure. How much do
                    you want?

                              ANDREW
                    I want to go back to work, Your
                    Honor.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    You're here at my indulgence,
                    young man. I'm waiting for a
                    figure, Joe.

Andrew and Joe confer with each other.

                              JOE
                    Based on what my client would
                    have earned over the next three
                    years, including benefits and
                    projected raises, and the
                    extraordinary cost of medical
                    care for someone with Acquired
                    Immune Deficiency Syndrome...
                    We would settle today for the
                    very fair amount of one million
                    five hundred thousand dollars.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda,
                    I've got a figure over here, of
                    one million, five. I...

Andrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge:

                              JOE
                    One more thing, Your Honor...

                              ANDREW
                         (jumping in)
                    Any settlement agreement must
                    include, and this is critical,
                    a letter of exoneration, making
                    clear my termination had nothing
                    to do with the quality of my work.

Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine.

                              BELINDA CONINE
                    Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's
                    incompetence nearly sabotaged a
                    350 million dollar suit.

                              ANDREW
                    I was the one who was sabotaged.

                              BELINDA CONINE
                    We have complaints about Mr.
                    Beckett's lack of preparation,
                    his disorganization, his
                    arrogant, defensive attitude...
                    The list goes on.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    We have letters.

                              JOE
                    Why haven't you produced these
                    letters?

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Take it easy.
                         (to Wheeler)
                    What's the big deal, Chuck? The
                    boy wants a letter, to show to
                    his mother, for her to keep after
                    he's gone. Why are you being hard-
                    assed about this?

                              WHEELER
                    I wish I could exonerate you, Andy.
                    But I'd have to lie to do it.

                              ANDREW
                         (very calm)
                    You can save it for the jury,
                    Charles. I want to hear you say,
                    under oath, in front of a judge and
                    a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.
                         (rises)
                    Gentlemen.
                         (to Belinda)
                    Counselor.

                              WHEELER
                    Don't do this, Andy.

                              JOE
                    Whoa, whoa...
                         (to Andrew)
                    What do you expect them to say,
                    you're Alan Dershowitz?

                              KENTON
                    A trial takes time, Beckett. Do
                    you know what I'm saying?

                              ANDREW
                    I think I catch your subtle drift,
                    Walter.

Andrew saunters out.

                              KENTON
                    You'll be sorry, Beckett.

                              WHEELER
                    Andy, you don't want this.

Joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into
a grin. He faces the Judge.

                              JOE
                    With all due respect, Your Honor,
                    my client chooses to pursue his
                    constitutionally guaranteed
                    right to a trial.

Joe exits.

                                                  CUT TO:

HAND HELD CAMERA SHOT OF: THE FRONT YARD OF A TWO-STORY
Colonial house in Downington, Pennsylvania (EXT./DAY) ...

Andrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.

                              ANDREW
                    This is the house where I grew up.
                    In Downington, Pennsylvania.
                         (pointing to the ground)
                    See this... ?

The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the
sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Those are my cute little hand
                    prints. And my brother's and my
                    sister's.

                              MIGUEL'S VOICE
                         (BEHIND CAMERA)
                    And today is... ?

                              ANDREW
                    Today is my parents' fortieth
                    wedding anniversary.

Andrew goes inside, speaking to the CAMERA:

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    This is the front door. I caught a
                    finger in this door, once...
                         (holds it up)
                    This one. Broke it.
                         (stepping inside)
                    This is the hallway, my mother
                    calls it a foyer...

INSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY):

CHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting
corsages confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into
Andrew's arms.

                              ALEXIS
                    Uncle Andrew!

                              ANDREW
                         (to CAMERA)
                    This is my niece, Alexis. Say
                    hello, Alexis.

                              ALEXIS
                    Mommy's pregnant again.

                              ANDREW
                         (doing Walter Cronkite)
                    You heard it here first, folks.
                    News as it happens.

Andrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her
arms around Andrew, squeezing tight.

                              JILL
                    Hello, darlin'.

                              ANDREW
                    This is my sister, Jill, the most
                    fertile woman on the planet. She's
                    married to Reverend Jim.

                              JILL
                    You feel thin.
                         (over Andrew's shoulder)
                    Hello, Miguel.

As Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO
ANDREW, who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG.

                              MIGUEL
                    Hey, Jill. Nice to see you,
                    sweetheart.

                              JILL
                         (hugging Miguel)
                    Handsome devil.
                         (referring to Andrew)
                    Is he eating?

                              MIGUEL
                    We don't discuss his weight.
                         (to Andrew, behind CAMERA)
                    Do we?

CAMERA MOVES DOWN THE CORRIDOR...

                              ANDREW (OS)
                    And what will we find in... da duh
                    da duh da duh... the KITCHEN!

A GROUP OF LADIES SCREAM when CAMERA ENTERS KITCHEN.

                              LADIES
                    There he is! Hi, Andrew! Don't
                    point that thing at me! etc...

Andrew's mother Sarah wears an unpretentious flowery dress.

                              ANDREW
                    Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your
                    fortieth anniversary?

                              SARAH
                    Ancient. How do you think I feel?
                    Put that thing down and give me a
                    hug.
                         (he keeps it pointed at her)
                    Andrew, stop! ... He still
                    doesn't listen.

                              ANDREW
                    Where's Dad?

                              SARAH
                    He's out in his shed showing your
                    uncle his new riding mower.

One of Andrew's YOUNG NEPHEWS SHOVES HIS FACE into the
CAMERA, UNTIL SCREEN GOES BLACK.

                                                  CUT TO:

QUIET (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting
quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an
American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds
the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers,
MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there.

Andrew sits next to Miguel.

                              ANDREW
                    Things might be said, at the
                    trial, that... are not going to
                    be easy for you to hear. Things
                    about me, about my private life.
                    And I want to make sure it's
                    okay with everybody.

                              MATT
                    I appreciate you asking, Andy,
                    but really, it's your call.

                              ANDREW
                    What do you think, Jill?

                              JILL
                    To be honest, I'm worried about
                    Mommy and Daddy. They've had to
                    go through so much already...
                    And, we all know...
                         (very difficult to say)
                    There's going to be even worse
                    things to deal with, eventually.
                    I wonder if it's fair to put
                    them through this.

Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.

                              ANDREW
                    Mom?

                              SARAH
                    All I know is, you got through
                    your diagnosis fine, like a
                    trooper. But when they fired
                    you... you were so devastated,
                    Andy... I don't expect any of
                    my kids to sit in the back of
                    the bus. Fight for your rights.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks, Mom... Dad?

There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.

                              BUD
                    Supposedly, the Lord doesn't
                    give you more trouble than you
                    can handle. But I'm having a
                    hard time believing that these days.

Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears
from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.

                              BUD (CONT.)
                    Andy, the way you've faced this
                    whole thing, you and Miguel, with
                    so much courage... your mother and
                    I have been so very impressed...

Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts
an arm around Andrew.

                              BUD (CONT.)
                    I can't imagine there is anything,
                    that anyone could say, that would
                    make us feel less proud of you.

                              ANDREW
                         (full of emotion)
                    Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How
                    about you, Randy?

                              RANDY
                    Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy.
                    That's the bottom line. I mean,
                    what are those bastards going to say?
                    You're gay? Shit, I knew that
                    when you were five years old.

Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.

                              MIGUEL
                    Wait a minute...
                         (to Andrew)
                    You're gay?

More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously:

                              JILL
                    What about you, Andy? You're not a
                    militant type. You've always
                    been so private.

CLOSE ON ANDREW:

                              ANDREW
                    I guess... I don't have time for
                    that any more.

                              SARAH
                    Jim? Will you lead us in a
                    prayer?

Everyone bows heads, holding hands in a circle.

                              REVEREND JIM
                    Dear Lord. Sometimes it is
                    difficult to remember to be
                    grateful...

CAMERA PANS THE CIRCLE, THE PRAYING FACES.

                              REVEREND JIM (CONT.)
                    To remember, in our times of
                    sorrow and confusion, that we
                    have You to turn to, and each
                    other. Bless and keep Andrew
                    and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen
                    and strengthen their love as
                    they face the struggles that lay
                    ahead. Bless and watch over all
                    of us, fill us with Your love,
                    Your light, and Your peace,
                    which passeth all understanding.
                    In Jesus' name, we pray...

                              EVERYONE
                    Amen.

ROMANTIC MUSIC CROSSES CUT TO:

BECKETTS' LIVINGROOM, SEEN THROUGH THE VIDEO CAMERA (DAY) ...

A local entertainer (GUIDO PAONESSA) launches into a
standard, accompanied by a single guitar player, and Bud and
Sarah begin to dance, surrounded by family and friends.

                    "After all the days of Spring
                    have flown..."

VIDEO CAMERA PANS: RELATIVES eating cake, KIDS chasing each
other, a GRANDMOTHER in a wheelchair holding a NEWBORN,
watching silent, video home movies.

CAMERA FINDS Andrew and Niguel eating anniversary cake
(Andrew barely touches his). Playing for the camera, Miguel
dips his finger into icing and smears it onto Andrew's nose.
Andrew tries to reach the icing with his tongue.

CAMERA PANS WITH ANDREW as he comes forward to dance with his
mother, while Jill dances with their father.

CAMERA RETURNS TO MIGUEL. MATT (behind the camera) says:

                              MATT (OS)
                    Hey, Miguel, can you imagine any
                    two people being together for forty
                    years?

ZOOM IN CLOSE ON NIGUEL (who's watching Andrew):

                              MIGUEL
                    Yes. I can.

VIDEO CAMERA PANS to Andrew dancing with his Mom, lingering on
this IMAGE...

                    No one will break down on the stand
                    with a tearful confession...

REVERSE ON JOE, ADDRESSING THE JURY.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    You are presented with a simple
                    fact: Andrew Beckett was fired.
                    You will hear two explanations for
                    why he was fired. Ours. And
                    theirs...

Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of...

ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've
ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing
thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a
much older man. He's taking notes (which he will do
relentlessly throughout the trial.) And he has a cane at his
side, which he'll use throughout the trial.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    It's up to you, to sift through
                    layer and layer of truth, and
                    determine for yourselves the
                    version that sounds the most true.

Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Bob Seidman, Kenneth Killcoyne
sit BEHIND their lawyers, Belinda Conine and Jerome Green, and
SEVERAL ASSISTANTS at the defense table.

JUDGE GARNETT presides from his bench.

Among the spectators, Miguel sits next to Sarah, and
Andrew's sister Jill. AIDS ACTIVISTS in the background.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    There are certain points in our
                    version, that I must prove to
                    you... Point number one: Andrew
                    Beckett was... is a brilliant
                    lawyer. A great lawyer. Point
                    number two. Andrew Beckett,
                    afflicted with a debilitating
                    disease, made the legal,
                    understandable, personal choice
                    to keep the fact of his illness
                    to himself... Point number three:
                    His employers discovered his
                    illness. And ladies and gentlemen,
                    the illness I'm referring to, is
                    AIDS...

Joe pauses, letting that sink in.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Point number four. They panicked.
                    And, in their panic, they did what
                    most of us would like to do with
                    AIDS... Get it, and the people
                    who have it, as far away from us
                    as possible.

Joe walks away from Andrew.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    The behavior of Andrew Beckett's
                    employers may seem reasonable to
                    you. It does to me. After all, AIDS
                    is a deadly, incurable, disease...

CLOSE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    But however you come to judge the
                    behavior of Charles Wheeler and
                    his partners in moral, ethical,
                    human terms... When they fired
                    Andrew Beckett because he had
                    AIDS, they broke the law.

With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with
considerable power and emotion:

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    And, when lawyers break the law,
                    when this society loses respect
                    for the law, when that day comes,
                    our cherished institutions will be
                    burned to the ground, and our
                    children and grandchildren will
                    live like savages.

BELINDA CONINE ADDRESSING THE JURY (INT./DAY) ...

                              BELINDA
                    Fact. Andrew Beckett performed
                    at a consistently mediocre
                    level. Fact. He made a grievous
                    error on a multi-million dollar
                    lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is
                    the victim of lies and deceit.
                    Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his
                    employers, going to great efforts
                    to conceal his disease from them.
                    Fact. He was successful in his
                    duplicity. The partners at Wyant
                    Wheeler did not know Andrew
                    Beckett had AIDS when they fired
                    him...

Belinda pauses in front of the plaintiff's table

                              BELINDA (CONT.)
                    Fact. AIDS is a tragedy...

Andrew looks directly at Belinda.

                              BELINDA (CONT.)
                    Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.

Joe watches Andrew for his reaction.

                              BELINDA (CONT.)
                    Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry.
                    Because his "lifestyle," his
                    reckless behavior, has cut short
                    his life... And in his anger, his
                    rage, he's lashing out. And he
                    wants someone to pay.

                    Andrew Beckett represented your
                    company in a lawsuit in 1990, is
                    that correct?

                              LAIRD
                    Wyant Wheeler represented us.

Andrew glances toward the jury box: the MARINE JUROR writes in a
tiny notebook.

                              JOE
                    But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of
                    litigation for the suit.

                              LAIRD
                    That's correct.

                              JOE
                    Were you pleased with his work?

                              LAIRD
                    We were satisfied.

Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and
disappoints them.

                              JOE
                    Were you satisfied, or were you
                    pleased?

Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering.

                              LAIRD
                    We were satisfied.

Joe refers to legal documents.

                              JOE
                    Mr. Laird, when I approached you
                    about being a witness at this
                    trial, and you agreed, you gave
                    sworn testimony in a deposition.
                    Is that correct?

                              LAIRD
                    That's correct.

                              JOE
                    According to the deposition, you
                    said you were "thrilled, impressed,
                    overwhelmed" by the quality of
                    Andrew Beckett's work. Do you
                    remember saying that?

                              LAIRD
                    I may have said something like
                    that. But that's not how I feel at
                    this moment.

Joe takes on a street-tough tone:

                              JOE
                    Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to
                    me like I'm a four year old: Did
                    Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit
                    for you or not?

                              LAIRD
                    We won.

                              JOE
                    Did that thrill, impress and
                    overwhelm you?

                              LAIRD
                    It satisfied me.

Joe STARES at the guy.

                              JOE
                    It's a long way between being
                    overwhelmed and being satisfied.
                    A cheeseburger may be satisfying
                    whereas caviar and champagne and
                    roast duck and baked Alaska for
                    dessert might be considered
                    overwhelming. Do you agree?

                              LAIRD
                    I might.

                              JOE
                    Five months ago you characterized
                    Andrew Beckett as caviar and now
                    you're calling him a cheeseburger.
                    Your standards have shifted a
                    great deal, and I'd like to know
                    why you've changed your mind.

                              LAIRD
                    Since that time I've devoted more
                    thought to the subject, and that's
                    how I feel now.

                    Partner Robert Seidman was the
                    supervising attorney for your
                    lawsuit?

                              MR. LAIRD
                    That's right.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    Does the supervising attorney guide
                    the litigating attorney during
                    the trial?

                              MR. LAIRD
                    Often, he does.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    As far as you know, in the handling
                    of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was
                    simply following orders.

                              LAIRD
                    That's a fair assessment of the
                    situation.

Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who
meets his gaze.

                    How does that make you feel?"

All eyes turn to the TV: SARAH BECKETT IN CLOSE UP.

                              SARAH
                    "This is a world full of war,

JOE ADDRESSING A WITNESS IN COURT (INT./DAY) ...

                              JOE
                    And Walter Kenton knew the
                    lesions on your face and arms
                    were caused by AIDS?

The witness: MARIA TORRES, Hispanic, 35, healthy-looking.

                              MARIA
                    Definitely. People were going
                    around, whispering things. I
                    figured I didn't have anything
                    to lose, so I told all the
                    partners.

                              JOE
                    How did Walter Kenton treat you,
                    after you told him you had AIDS?

CLOSE ON KENTON, looking confident.

                              MARIA
                    Every time he came into contact
                    with me, he'd get this look on
                    his face. I called it, the
                    "Oh God" expression. As in "Oh
                    God, here comes that woman with
                    AIDS."

Andrew LAUGHS.

                              JOE
                    Ms. Torres? Have your employers
                    fired you for having AIDS?

                              MARIA
                    No. When I need time off, for
                    medical reasons, we work it out.

                              JOE
                    Thank you. No more questions.

Jerome Green rises.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    Miss Torres. How did you contract
                    the AIDS virus?

                              MARIA
                    During a transfusion. I lost
                    a lot of blood giving birth to my
                    second child.

                              JEROME GREEN
                    In other words, in your case
                    you happen to be an innocent
                    victim of the AIDS tragedy.

                              MARIA
                    Look. I'm no different from
                    everyone else who has this
                    disease: I'm not guilty, I'm
                    not innocent. I'm just trying
                    to survive.

                    things about his appearance

                    He was losing weight. He looked

                    was working so hard... Still, I

                    Sorry.

                    Yes.

                    Wheeler had a problem with my
                    earrings.

                              JOE
                    Your earrings?

Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings.

                              ANTHEA
                    Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt
                    they were too... "ethnic" is the
                    word she used. She said he
                    would like it if I wore
                    something smaller, less garish,
                    and... more "American."

                              JOE
                    What did you say?

                              ANTHEA
                    I said my earrings are American.
                    They're African-American.

                    I saw you on television. I'm a
                    law student. At Penn.

Joe is flattered by the YOUNG MAN'S interest.

                              JOE
                    Good school. What year?

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Second.

                              JOE
                    Great.

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Would you like to have a drink
                    with me? I just finished a
                    game, I could use a beer.
                         (a smile)
                    I don't pick up people in drug
                    stores every day.

                              JOE
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you
                    think... ? You think I'm...
                         (low)
                    ... gay?

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Aren't you?

                              JOE
                    What's the matter with you? Do
                    I look gay to you?

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Do I look gay to you? Relax.

                              JOE
                    Relax? I ought to kick your
                    faggoty little ass for you!

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Take it as a compliment. Geesh.

But Joe is really upset. People are watching.

                              JOE
                    Don't you know this is exactly
                    the kind of bullshit that makes
                    people hate you guys?

                              YOUNG MAN
                    Fuck you! You want to kick my
                    ass? You want to try?
                         (walking away)
                    Asshole.

                              JOE
                    You're the asshole, buddy.

                              YOUNG MAN
                         (going out)
                    Get a life.

Joe stands there, holding the Pampers, people STARING.

                              LISA
                    Don't know, Joe.

                              JOE
                    Is there some kind of expression
                    I've picked up from Beckett?!
                    Some kind of fairy attitude I've
                    unconsciously adopted?! Am I
                    walking different?! Some kind
                    of vocal thing?! Have I picked
                    up some kind of homo vibe?!

                    Very funny. I had a box of
                    Pampers under my arm for
                    Chrissake!

                    his dick in another guy's mouth?
                    It's disgusting.

They lie in silence for a moment. Then:

                              LISA
                    Okay, so... help me with this
                    one, Joe... Is it disgusting for
                    someone to put his dick into
                    someone's mouth? Or, is it
                    disgusting for someone to take
                    a dick into their mouth?

                              JOE (VO)
                    "But, ultimately, the complaint
                    was found, wasn't it?

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

WIDE ANGLE ON COURTROOM: JAMEY COLLINS ON THE STAND (DAY).

                              JAMEY
                    Yes. We found a copy. It been
                    incorrectly filed...

TITLE: "Plaintiff's case, day ten."

                              JAMEY (CONT.)
                    We got it to court on time.

ANGLE ON THE JURY: Several JURORS write in notebooks like the
Marine's; he's been handing them out...

Joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. When he
glances at Andrew, it's with irritation.

                              JOE
                    Has a file ever disappeared like
                    that before? Vanished into thin
                    air, all of a sudden, only to
                    reappear in the nick of time?

Jamey answers nervously:

                              JAMEY
                    I've never known that to happen
                    before. No.

                              JOE
                         (fires this question)
                    Did you have something to do
                    with this file being lost
                    accidentally-on-purpose?

                              BELINDA
                    Objection!

                              JOE
                    I'll rephrase.
                         (to Jamey)
                    Did you have anything to do with
                    this file being... misplaced?

                              JAMEY
                    Absolutely not.

Joe stands, staring at Jamey. Too long. Jamey squirms.

                              JOE
                    Are you a homosexual?

                              JAMEY
                    What?!

Joe pressing forward, toward Jamey.

                              JOE
                    C'mon, Mr. Collins. Are you
                    homosexual? You know, gay?

The COURTROOM ERUPTS: ACTIVISTS booing Joe, Wheeler's crowd
expressing OUTRAGE, JURORS looking confused.

Andrew takes in the commotion, as the JUDGE BANGS HIS GAVEL.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Hold it, hold it!

Andrew trains his attention on Joe.

                              BELINDA
                    Objection! Where has this come
                    from?! Suddenly Counsel is
                    attacking his own witness. Mr.
                    Collins' sexual orientation has
                    absolutely no relevance to this
                    case.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    I said, HOLD IT!
                         (the courtroom QUIETS)
                    Mr. Miller. Could you kindly share
                    with me exactly what's going on
                    in your brain, because I don't
                    have a clue at the moment.

Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to.

                              JOE
                    Your Honor, everyone in this
                    courtroom is thinking about sexual
                    preference, sexual orientation,
                    whatever you want to call it.
                    They're looking at me, and
                    wondering about it...
                         (looking at Andrew)
                    They're looking at Mr. Beckett, and
                    wondering about it. They're looking
                    at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about
                    it. They might even be looking at
                    you and wondering about it. So,
                    let's get it out in the open. Let's
                    talk about what this case is really
                    about: the general public's
                    hatred... our loathing, our fear of
                    homosexuals.

DEAD SILENCE while the Judge thinks it over.

CLOSE ON ANDREW.

                              ANDREW
                         (to himself)
                    Very good.

CLOSE ON BELINDA CONINE.

CLOSE ON CHARLES WHEELER.

CLOSE ON MIGUEL.

CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON.

CLOSE ON BOB SEIDMAN.

CLOSE ON THE MARINE JUROR.

CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,
                    justice is blind. To matters of
                    race, creed, color, religion.
                    And sexual orientation.

                              JOE
                    With all due respect, Your Honor...
                    We don't live in this courtroom,
                    do we?

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    No. We don't... However, as
                    regards this witness, I'm going to
                    sustain the defense's objection.

                                                  CUT TO:

COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY).

The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN
UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty
urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while
he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The
BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh."

The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change.

The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal
between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems
to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary
organ. This does not escape the MARINE'S notice.

                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
                         (innocently, to Marine)
                    I have some gay friends. What's
                    the biggie?

The MARINE says nothing.

                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.)
                    Everybody has a couple of gay
                    friends. Don't you?

                              MARINE
                    No, sir. I do not.

The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see
his private parts.

                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
                    You might have them, and just
                    not know they're gay.

The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look
directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR.

                              MARINE
                    I know.

                                                  CUT TO:

WALTER KENTON ON THE WITNESS STAND (INT./DAY) ...

                              JOE
                    And how many weeks at a time
                    would you be out to sea, without
                    stopping at port?

                              KENTON
                    Anywhere from two weeks, to
                    several months.

                              JOE
                    Any women on board?

Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR.

                              KENTON
                    Not when I was in the Navy.

                              JOE
                    So during those long voyages,
                    months at a time, out to sea, no
                    women in sight, a hundred,
                    hardworking, robust, young men,
                    in the prime of their life, at
                    the peak of their natural
                    appetites, desires, their god-
                    given, hormonal instincts...
                    Anything going on?

                              KENTON
                    Going on... like...? 

                              JOE
                    Like... two sailors playing hide
                    the salami.

Andrew covers his face with his hands.

                              BELINDA
                    Objection!

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Mr. Miller!

                              KENTON
                         (can't resist)
                    We had one guy like that.

                              BELINDA
                    You haven't ruled on my
                    objection, Your Honor.

Kenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with
crossed arms, waiting.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Let's continue.

                              JOE
                         (to Kenton)
                    You had one guy "like that?"

                              KENTON
                    Yeah. But we took care of him.

                              JOE
                    How did you do that?

                              KENTON
                    We stuck his head in the
                    latrine, after ten of us had
                    used it.

LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some
JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS.

The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL.

                              JOE
                    You taught him a lesson.

                              KENTON
                    Yes, we did.

                              JOE
                    Like firing Andrew Beckett
                    taught him a lesson?

                              BELINDA
                    Objection!

                              JOE
                    I'll withdraw.
                         (moving on quickly)
                    You were aware, when you worked
                    with Maria Torres, that she had
                    AIDS, correct?

                              KENTON
                    She didn't try to conceal it.

                              JOE
                    So you are aware of the
                    difference between a lesion and
                    a bruise, is that correct?

                              KENTON
                    I know the difference. That
                    doesn't mean I'm always able to
                    recognize the difference.

                              JOE
                    But didn't you avoid contact
                    with Ms. Torres, after you found
                    out she had AIDS? She says you
                    acted repulsed by her and you
                    avoided her, is that correct?

                              KENTON
                    I felt, and still feel, nothing
                    but the deepest sympathy and
                    compassion for people like
                    Maria, who have contracted this
                    terrible disease through no
                    fault of their own.

                              CUT TO LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC:

IN THE KITCHEN OF THEIR APARTMENT, MIGUEL POURS MEDICINE
into an IV drip unit (INT./NIGHT) ...

LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.

Miguel glances at a chart on the wall, in which a day is
broken into hours, with medical instructions for each hour

                              MIGUEL
                         (shouting over MUSIC)
                    Drew! Are you ready? If we
                    start at eight, we'll be done by
                    twelve.

Miguel taps the IV bag, getting the drip started.

A cat jumps onto the counter. Miguel holds it.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANDREW SITS AT THE DININGROOM TABLE, MAKING NOTES ON A LEGAL
pad, holding out his left arm (INT./NIGHT). A catheter is
imbedded into Andrew's arm, and Miguel is trying to get the
IV drip started through the catheter. The MUSIC is lower...

                              MIGUEL
                    It's not going through.

                              ANDREW
                         (focused on his work)
                    We'll have to flush it again.

Andrew reaches for a law book.

                              MIGUEL
                    Hold still. Shit.
                         (trying again)
                    The goddamn vein's clotted. We
                    have to go the goddamn hospital,
                    so they can change the goddamn
                    catheter.

                              ANDREW
                    I have too much work to do.
                    Skip the treatment.

                              MIGUEL
                    We're not skipping this
                    treatment.

                              ANDREW
                    I said, skip it, Michael. It's
                    my treatment.

                              MIGUEL
                    Fuck you.

                              ANDREW
                    Fuck you. This shit's probably
                    not doing me any good anyway.

                              MIGUEL
                    That shit's saving your life,
                    you asshole!

Miguel shoves away from the table.

                              ANDREW
                    What's wrong with you?

                              MIGUEL
                    Close the law book.

                              ANDREW
                    I'm not going to close the--

                              MIGUEL
                    CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!

Andrew slams it SHUT.

                              ANDREW
                    ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!
                         (beat)
                    Jesus!

                              MIGUEL
                    The least you can do is look at
                    me, while I'm sticking this shit
                    into your arm. Forget the
                    fucking case, one hour a day,
                    and give me a little of your
                    time.

                              ANDREW
                         (very quiet)
                    You don't think there's much
                    time left, do you?

                              MIGUEL
                    That's not what I said.

                              ANDREW
                    You're scared. You think we're
                    near the end.

                              MIGUEL
                    No.

                              ANDREW
                    Maybe I should start making plans, is
                    that what you think? Start
                    planning my memorial service?
                    "Begin to prepare for the
                    inevitable."

                              MIGUEL
                         (low)
                    Maybe you should think about it.

                              ANDREW
                    What's that mean?!

                              MIGUEL
                         (very difficult)
                    Maybe you should think about it.

A MOMENT.

                              ANDREW
                    I'm not going to die.

                              MIGUEL
                    That's right. We're on the
                    Positive Plan. You
                    don't have a Fatal Disease, you
                    have Manageable Illness.

                              ANDREW
                    You want me to give up? Let this
                    thing turn us into victims?

                              MIGUEL
                    Then, what are we, Drew?! The
                    winners? "Ladies and gentlemen,
                    the first prize of AIDS goes to
                    Andrew Beckett and his lover
                    Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not
                    your lover. I'm your Care Partner.
                    FUCK!

                              ANDREW
                    I'm not ready to die.

                              MIGUEL
                    Do you think I'm ready for it?!
                    I hate this shit. I'm not a
                    fucking martyr! I hate every
                    goddamn part of it!

Miguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap.

Andrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight.

                              MIGUEL (CONT.)
                    Please don't leave me. I love
                    you so much. Don't die, don't
                    leave me, please...

Miguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his
head, holding tight.

                              ANDREW
                    I am so scared. I am so fucking,
                    incredibly, fucking scared...

A MOMENT. Andrew stroking Miguel's hair, as he calms down.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    You know, there's only one thing to
                    do.
                         (beat)
                    We have to have a party.

                                                  CUT TO:

JOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- IN COSTUME.
DANCE MUSIC is playing inside (INT./NIGHT) ...

Lisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly
thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal
document stapled all over the suit.

                              JOE
                    Did I ever tell you, I hate
                    costume parties?

                              LISA
                    My lettuce is wilting.

The DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big
hair, leather, guitar.

                              ANDREW (AS ROCKER)
                    PARRTYY!

                              JOE
                    We're friends of Beckett's.

                              ANDREW
                    It's me, you dork.

                              LISA
                    I'm Lisa Miller.

                              ANDREW
                    Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (HE LIMPS, relying
on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY). The room is filled
with two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup
(INT./NIGHT) ...

                              ANDREW
                         (to Lisa)
                    I have to introduce you to the
                    can of soup. You can enter the
                    costume contest together as a
                    lunch special.

Miguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX.
He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff.
Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then:

                              ANDREW
                    This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez.

Miguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS.
Everyone ad libs greetings.

                              MIGUEL
                    My sister, Maria.
                         (to Lisa)
                    Pastrami on rye?

                              LISA
                    Corned beef.

                              MIGUEL
                    Want to dance?

                              LISA
                    Sure!

Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up.

                              JOE
                    Beckett. You seem... better.
                    Energized, more alive...

                              ANDREW
                    I had a blood transfusion today.
                    I feel great.

Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume.

                              JOE
                    I'm a law suit.

                              ANDREW
                    Not bad.

                              JOE
                    Get it?

                              ANDREW
                    Let's find you a drink.

Andrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin
painted blue (SMURFETTE) her daughter AMY (BART SIMPSON),
Anthea, TYRONE from Dr. Gillman's office (A COWBOY), and
TYRONE'S LOVER (A HORSE) ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS
are here too, including the YOUNG ASIAN MAN who is now in a
wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S SIBLINGS may be
present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and some arty
friends and neighbors.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    What do you want?

                              JOE
                    Beer.
                         (patting his briefcase)
                    We need to go over your Q and A.

                              ANDREW
                    Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn
                    party, is that allright with you?

                              JOE
                    Sure. It's fine.

                              ANDREW
                    No, we have to do it. But
                    later, allright?

                              JOE
                    Thank you.

A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes
past Joe, reaching for a beer.

                              LA TOYA
                    'Scuse me, darling.

Andrew is SMILING at Joe.

                              JOE
                    You think I'm uncomfortable...

                              ANDREW
                    Correct.

                              JOE
                    You're right.

Joe spills beer down his shirt.

                              ANDREW
                    Thank you.

          CUT TO A SERIES OF PARTY MOMENTS OVER LOUD MUSIC:

--Andrew and Miguel ROCKING to HEAVY METAL MUSIC, playing a
battle of the guitars. At one point, Andrew has to sit
down, but he doesn't stop "playing," while Miguel jumps all
around him.

--Joe talking to a MAN DRESSED AS MARIE ANTOINETTE:

                              MARIE ANTOINETTE
                    I'm an accountant. What do you do?

                              JOE
                    I'm a lawyer.
                         (points to Lisa)
                    That's my wife!

--Andrew's mother Sarah, as Marge Simpson, delivers a tray
of hors d'oeuvres to Joe (standing next to a POLICEMAN):

                              SARAH
                    Have a cocktail wienie.

                              JOE
                    Thanks, Sarah.
                         (to the POLICEMAN)
                    Nice costume.

                              POLICEMAN
                    It's not a costume, I just got
                    off work. You're cute.

                              JOE
                         (pointing to Lisa)
                    That's my wife. Want to see a
                    picture of my baby?

                              POLICEMAN
                         (reaching for his wallet)
                    Absolutely. Want to see a
                    picture of my baby?

--Everyone SLOW DANCES to the Talking Heads tune "Heaven"
(Simply Red cover version): Joe and Lisa, Andrew and
Miguel, Rachel with a sleepy Amy in her arms, the POLICEMAN
and TYRONE, Sarah Beckett and MARIE ANTOINETTE, LA TOYA and
her snake.

                              "HEAVEN" CONTINUES OVER:

A CAB IDLING IN THE STREET, LISA KISSING JOE (NIGHT).

                              JOE
                    I'll see you in an hour, max.

                              LISA
                    Night, honey.

Lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the NUN
and MARIE ANTOINETTE and LA TOYA.

                              NUN/MARIE ANTOINETTE/LA TOYA
                    Night, Joe!

                              "HEAVEN" CONTINUES OVER:

QUIET IN ANDREW'S CONDO, THE PARTY LONG OVER (INT/NIGHT).

Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.

                              ANDREW
                    Congratulations, Miller.

Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space
for his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is
connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move
with him. He is no longer in costume.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    You survived your first gay
                    party intact.

                              JOE
                    Let me tell you something, okay?
                    When you're brought up, like the
                    rest of us, in a place like where
                    I was brought up, there's not a
                    whole lot of discussion about...
                    homosexuals.
                    As a kid, you're taught right away
                    that queers are weird, queers are
                    funny, they're a danger to kids,
                    they're afraid to fight, and they
                    all want to cop your joint. And
                    that pretty much sums up the
                    general thinking out there, if you
                    want to know the truth.

                              ANDREW
                    Thank you for sharing that with me,
                    Joe.

                              JOE
                    Let's review these notes for your
                    testimony. We have a big day on
                    Monday.

Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    When you refer to Wheeler, call him
                    Charles, to show how you'd been
                    admitted to the inner circle, you
                    were considered one of them.

                              ANDREW
                         (distracted)
                    Uh huh...

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Beckett?

                              ANDREW
                    Charles. Okay. Miller?

                              JOE
                    What?

                              ANDREW
                    Do you... pray?

Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?

                              JOE
                    Yeah. Sure.

Joe goes back to the notes:

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Then we establish how Wheeler's
                    boys recruited you after law
                    school...

                              ANDREW
                    What have you prayed for?

                              JOE
                    For a healthy baby. For Lisa to
                    make it through the delivery.
                    For the Phillies to get into the
                    playoffs.

                              ANDREW
                         (no self-pity)
                    There's a possibility I won't be
                    around for the end of this
                    trial.

                              JOE
                    I've considered that.

                              ANDREW
                    What happens?

                              JOE
                    We proceed, representing your
                    estate.

                              ANDREW
                    I've made provisions in my will
                    for some charities. Miguel will
                    need a lawyer. I know it's not
                    your area...

                              JOE
                    I know a good probate lawyer.

                              ANDREW
                    Thanks.
                         (a beat)
                    Do you like opera?

Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.

                              JOE
                    Opera?

                              ANDREW
                    Want to hear my favorite aria?

                              JOE
                    Opera?

SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM --
startling Joe with its VOLUME.

                              ANDREW
                         (over the MUSIC)
                    Andrea Chenier, by Giordano.
                    This is Madeleine. She's
                    telling how, during the French
                    revolution, a mob set
                    fire to her house. Her mother
                    died, saving her.

                    "I look...
                    The place that cradled me was
                    burning!"

                    Do you hear the heartache in her
                    voice? Then, here come the
                    strings. Everything changes.
                    The music fills with hope.
                    Madeleine says...

Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV
at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    "It was during that sorrow that
                    love came to me!

                    A voice filled with harmony
                    That said...
                    Live still, I am Life!"

                    "I am the god that descends
                    From the heavens to the earth
                    To make of the earth
                    A heaven!"

ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    "I am Oblivion!
                    I am Glory!
                    I am Love, Love, Love!"

The MUSIC ENDS.

Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase
organizing his notes.

                              JOE
                    I think I'll... I told Lisa.

Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.

                              ANDREW
                    Right.

Andrew follows Joe to the door.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                         (businesslike)
                    I'll look over the Q and A.

                              JOE
                    You're ready, don't worry.

An awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at
their sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake?

Joe gives a little "salute," then leaves.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOE COMES DOWN THE HALLWAY OF THE MODERN CONDO BUILDING
(INT./NIGHT) ...

                              JOE
                    Jesus.

Suddenly, Joe HEARS: OPERA MUSIC PLAYING AGAIN.

He pauses, listening.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

ANDREW MOVES THROUGH THE ROOM, DRINKING IN THE BEAUTIFUL,
passionate MUSIC (INT./NIGHT) ...

The IV stand catches against the sofa, tugging the line.

Andrew pulls the line out of his arm. He moves, freer now.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

JOE STANDS OUTSIDE ANDREW'S DOOR, OPERA MUSIC PLAYING
(INT./NIGHT) ...

Joe lifts his hand to KNOCK.

He changes his mind.

                              JOE
                    Fucking guy...

Joe moves down the corridor, rings for the elevator.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

ANDREW MOVING THROUGH SHADOWS, IN THE APARTMENT, LETTING THE
MUSIC pull him along (INT./NIGHT) ...

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

JOE STEPPING INTO THE ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT).

The doors closing.

                                        INTERCUT WITH:

ANDREW AND THE MUSIC (INT./NIGHT).

                    MUSIC FADING, CROSSES THE CUT TO:

EXTERIOR: JOE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT...

Joe crosses the yard to his dark house.

                    MUSIC DISTANT, CROSSES THE CUT TO:

JOE'S BABY LIES SLEEPING IN HER CRIB (INT./NIGHT).

Joe looks down on the baby, adjusting the blanket.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

LISA FACES CAMERA, ASLEEP IN THE DARK BEDROOM (INT./NIGHT).

Joe doffs his jacket, sinking quietly onto the edge of the
bed, careful not to disturb Lisa.

With his BACK TO CAMERA, Joe puts his head into his hands...

And begins to weep.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN: PANORAMIC SHOT OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS...

                                                  CUT TO:

HIGH, WIDE ANGLE ON THE COURTROOM, IN SILENCE (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew moves very slowly with his cane across the courtroom,
toward the witness stand.

--JUDGE GARNETT crosses his arms, waiting.

--JOE glances at some notes.

--MIGUEL and SARAH BECKETT look on anxiously.

--WHEELER and the others observe in silence.

CAMERA HOLDS ON BIBLE BEING CARRIED IN GLOVED HANDS, ACROSS
THE COURTROOM. OVER THIS SHOT IS A...

TITLE: "Plaintiff's case. day fourteen."

The BAILIFF places the Bible in front of Andrew (a purple
blotch is showing in front of Andrew's ear.)

                              BAILIFF
                    Place your left hand on the
                    Bible and raise your right hand.

Andrew places his hand on the Bible.

                              BAILIFF
                    "Do you swear to tell the truth...

                    DIALOGUE OVERLAP AND DISSOLVE TO:

ANDREW ANSWERING A QUESTION AN HOUR OR SO LATER (INT./DAY).

                              ANDREW
                    Wyant Wheeler had aggressively
                    recruited me. They were the
                    most prestigious firm in
                    Philadelphia, full of
                    opportunity. And I was
                    impressed by the partners.

                              JOE
                    Including Charles Wheeler?

(Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a
handkerchief. His voice is hoarse, raspy.)

                              ANDREW
                    Particularly, Charles.

ANGLE ON WHEELER.

                              JOE
                    What impressed you about him?

                              ANDREW
                    He was... the kind of person I
                    thought I wanted to be.

                              JOE
                    What kind of person is that?

                              ANDREW
                    Possessed of an encyclopedic
                    knowledge of the law. A razor
                    sharp litigator, a genuine
                    leader, gifted at bringing out
                    the very best in others. An
                    awesome ability to illuminate
                    the most complex of legal
                    concepts to colleagues,
                    courtrooms, the person on the
                    street.
                         (a smile)
                    The kind of person
                    who plays three sets of tennis but
                    doesn't sweat. But underneath the
                    elegant surface, was an
                    adventurous spirit.

Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT.

                              JOE
                    Obviously, at this time, you
                    weren't sick.

                              ANDREW
                    It's possible I was infected with
                    the HIV virus at that time, but I
                    wasn't diagnosed until several years
                    later.

                              JOE
                    You didn't look then, the way you
                    look now?

REVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.)

                              ANDREW
                    No. I was thirty pounds heavier.
                    I was athletic.

                              JOE
                    A regular all-American guy?

                              ANDREW
                    I suppose you could say that.

                              JOE
                    Except... you were gay?

                              ANDREW
                    I still am.

SPECTATORS CHUCKLE.

                              JOE
                    In the years you worked at Wyant
                    Wheeler, did you ever tell
                    Charles Wheeler you were gay?

                              ANDREW
                    No. I didn't.

                              JOE
                    Can you explain why you didn't?

                              ANDREW
                    You don't bring your personal
                    life into a law firm. You're
                    not supposed to have a personal
                    life, really. Anyway, I did
                    plan to tell Charles,
                    eventually. But then, this
                    thing happened at the tennis
                    club...

                    I'm seeing him this afternoon.

INSIDE THE SAUNA: CAMERA PANS SEVERAL MEN.

                    What do you call a woman who has
                    PMS and ESP at the same time?.

                              SECOND MAN
                    What?

                              FIRST MAN
                    A bitch who knows everything.

LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the
wall of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing.

                              CHARLES WHEELER
                    How does a faggot fake an orgasm?

Andrew opens one eye.

                              CHARLES WHEELER (CONT.)
                    He spits on your back.

                              SEIDMAN
                    Charles, that's revolting!

All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST.

                              JOE (VOICE OVER)
                    How did that make you feel?

IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And
it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS).

                              ANDREW
                    Relieved. That I'd never told
                    him I was gay. Very relieved.

ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial.

                              JOE
                    Are you a good lawyer?

                              ANDREW
                    I'm an excellent lawyer.

                              JOE
                    What makes you an excellent
                    lawyer?

                              ANDREW
                    I love the law. I know the law.
                    I excel at practicing it. It's
                    the only thing I've ever wanted to do.

                              JOE
                    What do you love about it?

                              ANDREW
                    Well... many things. But I
                    think the thing I love the most,
                    is that every once in a while,
                    not that often, but
                    occasionally... you get to be
                    part of justice being done.
                    It's really quite a thrill when
                    that happens.

                                                  CUT TO:

BELINDA CONINE STANDS BEFORE ANDREW (INT./DAY).

                              BELINDA
                    You said earlier you aspired to
                    be the kind of person who had
                    "an adventurous spirit." Is
                    that correct?

                              ANDREW
                    Something like that.

                              BELINDA
                    Do you take risks?

                              ANDREW
                    In my work? Yes. Calculated
                    risks. You have to.

                              BELINDA
                    In general. Do you take risks
                    in other areas of your life?

                              ANDREW
                    Not unnecessary ones.

                              BELINDA
                    Have you ever been to the Apollo
                    Cinema on Sansom Street?

Joe cringes a little with discomfort.

                              ANDREW
                         (looking Belinda right
                         in the eye)
                    A few times.

                              BELINDA (OS)
                    What kind of movies do they show
                    there?

                              ANDREW (OS)
                    Gay movies.

BACK IN COURT (INT./DAY):

                              BELINDA
                    Gay pornographic movies?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes.

                              BELINDA
                    Do men have sex with each other
                    in that theater?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes.

                    How about you, Mr. Beckett?

                              BELINDA (OS) (CONT.)

                    someone in that theater?

                    Yes.

BACK IN COURT, ON ANDREW:

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Once.

                              ANDREW
                    Andrew.

Andrew steps into the booth.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Now what do we do?

Robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.

                              ROBERT
                    I think we'll figure it out.

BACK TO THE COURTROOM (INT./DAY):

Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.

                              BELINDA
                    When? Approximately what year did
                    this event take place?

                              ANDREW
                    I guess it was 1984, 85.

                              BELINDA
                    Were you aware in 1984 or 1985
                    that there was a fatal disease
                    out there, called AIDS, and that
                    you could contract it through
                    sexual activity?

                              ANDREW
                    It's impossible to know exactly
                    when or how I was infected with HIV.

                              BELINDA
                    But you were having anonymous
                    sex in porno theaters in 1984
                    and 1985?

                              ANDREW
                    That happened once. People
                    weren't talking about AIDS then,
                    the way we are now. Or safe
                    sex.

                              BELINDA
                    You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?

                              ANDREW
                    I'd heard of something. The gay
                    plague, gay cancer, but... we
                    didn't know how you could get it,
                    or that it could kill you.

CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW -- losing strength.

                              BELINDA (OS)
                         (sounds far away)
                    Do you need a break?

                              ANDREW
                    No.

                              BELINDA
                    While you were employed at Wyant
                    Wheeler, you did everything you
                    could to make sure no one knew
                    you were an active homosexual,
                    correct?

                              ANDREW
                    That is not correct. I never lied
                    about it.

                              BELINDA
                    Did you keep a picture of your
                    lover on your desk?

                              ANDREW
                    No.

                              BELINDA
                    Do other lawyers at the firm keep
                    pictures of their spouses or
                    fiances on their desks?

PHOTO ON THE WALL OF BOB'S WIFE AND CHILDREN (INT./DAY).

                              ANDREW
                    Some do. I didn't.

                              BELINDA
                    As a homosexual, one is often forced
                    to conceal one's sexuality, is
                    that right?

                              ANDREW
                    In some situations.

                              BELINDA
                    Isn't it true you have spent your
                    life pretending to be something
                    you're not, so much so that the
                    art of concealment and dishonesty
                    has become second nature to you?!

                              JOE
                    Objection!

                              BELINDA
                    I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett?
                    Were you living with Miguel
                    Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you
                    had your anonymous sexual encounter
                    in the porn theater?

ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.

                              ANDREW
                    Yes.

                              BELINDA
                    You could have infected him, isn't
                    that right?

                              ANDREW
                    Miguel has not been infected. As
                    I said, we weren't aware of AIDS,
                    then, or how it is spread.

                              BELINDA
                    Really?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes.

Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.

                              BELINDA
                    You've testified the lesions on
                    your face were visible to the
                    people you worked with, correct?

                              ANDREW
                    That's right.

                              BELINDA
                    And it's your contention, that
                    when the partners were made
                    aware of the lesions, they
                    jumped to the conclusion you had
                    AIDS and fired you.

                              ANDREW
                    Absolutely.

                              BELINDA
                    Do you have any lesions on your
                    face at this time?

                              ANDREW
                    One. Here, in front of my ear.

An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it
before Andrew.

                              BELINDA
                    Remembering you are under oath,
                    answering truthfully, can you
                    see the lesion on your face, in
                    this mirror, three feet away?
                    Answering truthfully.

Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible.

                              ANDREW
                    By the time I was fired, there
                    were four lesions on my face,
                    much bigger...

                              BELINDA
                    Answer the question, please.

                              ANDREW
                    No. I can't really see it.

                              BELINDA
                    Thank you.

Andrew rubs his eyes.

                              JUDGE GARNETT (OS)
                         (far away)
                    This would be a good time to
                    break for the day...

                              JOE (OS)
                         (far away)
                    Your Honor? May I have ten
                    minutes in re-direct?

                              JUDGE GARNETT (OS)
                         (far away)
                    Beckett?

Andrew finds the Judge looking at him.

                              JUDGE GARNETT (CONT.)
                    Can you go on for ten minutes?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes sir.

Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table.

                              JOE
                    I only need five!
                         (to Belinda, reaching
                         for the mirror)
                    May I?

Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    Do you have any lesions on any
                    part of your body, at this time,
                    that resemble the lesions that
                    were on your face at the time
                    you were fired?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes. On my torso.

                              JOE
                    If it please the court, I'd like
                    to ask Mr. Beckett to
                    remove his shirt, so that the
                    jury can have an accurate idea
                    of what we're talking about.

                              BELINDA
                    We object, Your Honor. It would
                    unfairly influence the jury.

                              JOE
                    Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was
                    forced by his illness to use a
                    wheelchair, would the defense
                    ask him to park it outside?
                    We're talking about AIDS, we're
                    talking about lesions. Let's
                    see what we're talking about.

ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                         (a moment, then)
                    I'll allow it. Would you mind
                    removing your shirt, Mr.
                    Beckett?

ANGLE ON MIGUEL -- TENSE.

                              ANDREW
                    Allright.

The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT.

Andrew removes his suit jacket. He's weak, so the smallest
gesture requires effort.

ANGLE ON BOB SEIDMAN -- WATCHING.

Andrew undoes his tie.

ANGLE ON THE MARINE JUROR -- WATCHING.

Andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down.

ANGLE ON SARAH BECKETT -- WATCHING.

Andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers.

ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER -- WATCHING.

Andrew removes his shirt -- THERE ARE PURPLE BLOTCHES
SPLAYED ACROSS HIS CHEST AND ABDOMEN AND ARMS.

The SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR GASPS.

Sarah Beckett is silently crying.

The LESBIAN JUROR closes her eyes.

                              JOE
                    Can you see the lesions on your
                    chest in this mirror?

                              ANDREW
                    Yes.

                              JOE
                    Thank you.

CAMERA MOVES IN ON CHARLES WHEELER...

                                                  CUT TO:
COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, ACTIVITY (INT./DAY) ...

Charles Wheeler strides down the corridor, flanked by
Kenton, Killcoyne and Belinda, discussing strategy.

Bob Seidman steps to Wheeler's side, keeping pace.

                              SEIDMAN
                    I've discovered something
                    interesting, Charles.

                              WHEELER
                         (to Belinda)
                    ... keep them from that area,
                    on grounds of relevancy.
                         (to Seidman)
                    What, Bob?

                              SEIDMAN
                    No matter how hard I try, I
                    can't lose a file in my
                    computer.

NOW he's got EVERYONE'S attention.

                              SEIDMAN (CONT.)
                    The system automatically makes a
                    backup.

Belinda holds up both hands, interrupting with:

                              BELINDA
                    I don't think I should hear this.

She walks away, giving a glance over her shoulder as:

                              SEIDMAN
                    You can erase the backup...
                         (a challenge to Wheeler)
                    But why would you?

                              KENTON
                         (venomous)
                    What's the point, Bob?

                              WHEELER
                         (calm)
                    Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a
                    note of that. Andy didn't lose the
                    complaint in his computer. He
                    never put it in. He lied about
                    that, too.

                              SEIDMAN
                         (weary)
                    Charles...

                              WHEELER
                    If you feel differently, Bob, you
                    should say so, when you're called
                    to the stand. After all, this
                    isn't a conspiracy.

Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the
high-ceilinged corridor.

Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the
rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.

                                                  CUT TO:

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND...

                              BELINDA
                    Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett
                    to your firm?

Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.

Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.

                              WHEELER
                    If you're the owner of a major
                    league ball club, you recruit the
                    hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously
                    promising as a young attorney.
                    That's why we went after him,
                    that's why we hired him, and
                    that's why we stuck with him,
                    year after year... waiting for
                    the promise to be fulfilled. But
                    it never was.

                              BELINDA
                    You kept giving him another chance?

                              WHEELER
                    Of course we did. When you've
                    groomed someone they way we groomed
                    Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all
                    kinds of special treatment on him...
                    you've made quite an investment.
                    We were waiting for his promise to
                    kick in, and deliver. But,
                    ultimately, we could no longer
                    ignore the gap between the promise
                    and the reality... This is one of
                    the saddest times in my life. To
                    sit in this court, testifying to
                    Andy's ultimate failure to make
                    the grade. To discover that he is
                    one of those people who wants to
                    benefit by the system, but doesn't
                    want to play by the system's
                    rules. To think you know someone,
                    only to find out... you don't know
                    them at all. It's heartbreaking.

                              BELINDA
                    Thank you. That's all for now,
                    Your Honor.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Mr. Miller?

Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.

                              JOE
                         (very gentle)
                    Explain to me, if you can, Mr.
                    Wheeler, explain this to me like
                    I'm a ten year-old. This trial is
                    not about a disease, is that what
                    you're saying? Not about your
                    understandable, if unfounded, fear
                    of catching AIDS through casual
                    contact with someone who has it?
                    You're saying, this trial is about
                    Andrew Beckett's character. Am I
                    getting this right?

                              WHEELER
                    Yes, character. To the extent that it
                    affects a person's ability to do
                    a great job.

Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing
difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while
Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR...

                              WHEELER (CONT.)
                    Andy worked when he wanted to work,
                    telling us what he thought we
                    needed to know about his
                    lifestyle...

ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel
begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get
the feeling she's giving her testimony).

                              RACHEL
                    I didn't mind covering for Andy,
                    but I did wonder... when was he
                    planning to deal with his problem?

Andrew blinks... what's going on?

Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler.

Everything seems normal.

                              WHEELER
                    Sometimes it seems like society
                    is run by these kinds of people.

                              JOE
                    What kind of people?

                              WHEELER
                    People who want to bend the rules...

ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:

                              KILLCOYNE
                    If you want to be a leader in this
                    society, you have to make
                    certain sacrifices.

Wheeler keeps speaking:

                              WHEELER
                    ... to suit their personal desires,
                    and the rest of us have to live
                    with it.

ANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON:

                              KENTON
                    You have to make a decision: is
                    this guy partner material?

                              JOE
                    Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler?
                    You?

ANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN:

                              SEIDMAN
                    Yes, I did see the lesions. I
                    suspected he was sick...

CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes.

THE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER:

                              WHEELER
                    The everyday, common person with
                    decent values...

                              RACHEL
                    It seems like he wasn't willing to
                    face the reality of his situation...

Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:

                              SEIDMAN
                    I didn't tell the others, I
                    was afraid to...

                              WHEELER
                    ... But now, we're standing up for
                    ourselves...

                              SEIDMAN
                    ... But we shouldn't have fired
                    him...

                              WHEELER
                    ... It's time to get this society
                    back on track!

Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV:

The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned.

ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor.

Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion.

He lies on the floor, looking up.

ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.

                              ANDREW
                    Could you call an ambulance,
                    please?

                                                  CUT TO:

A CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF
working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS
HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The
tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making
matters worse.

Miguel stands to the side, furious:

                              MIGUEL
                    It's making it worse. Take it
                    out. Take it out!

Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes,
obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries
assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and
Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over
Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide
open with fear, sweat covering his face.

                                                  CUT TO:

PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL, A BUSINESS DAY (EXT./DAY).

TITLE: "Two weeks later."

                              LESBIAN JUROR (VO)
                    If he was "mediocre," why did
                    they gave him this major
                    assignment three weeks before
                    they fired him?

                              POSTAL WORKER JUROR (VO)
                    They were testing him.

                                                  CUT TO:

JURORS SITTING AROUND A LONG TABLE IN A ROOM WITH TALL,
grimy windows (INT./DAY) ...

TITLE: "Jury deliberations."

                              WAITRESS JUROR
                    They wanted to see if he'd rise
                    to the challenge.

An American flag hangs on the wall.

                              SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR
                    They wanted to give him a final
                    chance.

                              POSTAL WORKER JUROR
                    Makes sense.

                              BUSINESSMAN JUROR
                    I'd still love to know what
                    happened to that missing file.

                              HOMEMAKER JUROR
                    Wouldn't we all?

                              POSTAL WORKER JUROR
                    Ask the computer.

                              COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR
                    They say he wasn't competent. But,
                    you heard him on the stand.

                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
                    He sounded pretty smart to me.

                              BUSINESSMAN JUROR
                    Why would they fire him? Why
                    not a medical leave, or...

                              COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR
                    They freaked out over the AIDS.

                              SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR
                    They hate homosexuals.

                              BUSINESSMAN JUROR
                    It's not against the law to
                    disapprove of homosexuals.

                              LESBIAN JUROR
                    It is against the law to fire someone
                    for having AIDS. That's why we're
                    here.

                              BUSINESSMAN JUROR
                    You're the foreman. You haven't said
                    anything. What do you think?

ANGLE ON -- THE MARINE, sitting at the head of the table.

CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON HIM:

                              MARINE JUROR
                    They're saying he wasn't a good
                    lawyer. He was mediocre. And the
                    fact that they gave him the most
                    important lawsuit they'd ever had,
                    for one of their most important
                    clients... they say that doesn't
                    prove anything, because that was
                    just a test. What did they call
                    it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise
                    to the occasion... Okay... Say
                    I've got to send a pilot into
                    enemy territory, and he's gonna
                    be flying a plane that cost 350
                    million dollars...
                    Who am I going to put into that
                    plane? A rookie who can't cut the
                    grade, because I want to see if
                    he'll rise to the challenge? Or am
                    I going to give that assignment to
                    my best pilot, my most experienced,
                    my sharpest, my top gun... The very
                    best I've got?

CLOSE ON THE MARINE:

                              MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
                    Could somebody please explain that
                    to me... like I'm a six year old?

HOLD ON THE MARINE, AS THE JUDGE'S VOICE FADES IN:

                              JUDGE GARNETT (VO)
                    Members of the jury, have you
                    reached a verdict?

                                                  AND CUT TO:

THE COURTROOM -- NO ONE STIRRING (INT./DAY).

Joe is utterly cool. Sitting beside Andrew's empty chair.

Among the spectators, Andrew's siblings, Jill, Matt, Randy, and
his parents, Bud and Sarah... Rachel, Anthea and Miguel's
sister Maria.

The Marine rises to his feet.

                              MARINE
                    We have, Your Honor...

Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye.

                              MARINE (CONT.)
                    We find for the plaintiff,
                    Andrew Beckett.

Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm.

Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine.

                              JUDGE GARNETT
                    Have you awarded any damages?

                              MARINE
                    Yes, we have, Your Honor.
                         (referring to a list)
                    For back pay and loss of benefits
                    ... one hundred fortythree
                    thousand dollars.

Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount.

Wheeler and his crew SMILE -- THIS IS THEIR VICTORY.

                              MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
                    For damages related to mental
                    anguish and humiliation... we give
                    no award.

Joe is extremely disappointed.

                              MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
                    And punitive damages we award...
                    Four million, eight hundred and
                    eighty two thousand dollars.

Joe throws his pen over his shoulder.

COURTROOM BURSTS INTO AN UPROAR.

Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush
forward, pounding him on the back. Andrew's family members
hug each other...

CAMERA CRANES AWAY FROM THIS GROUP, RISING TOWARD THE
CEILING AS THE SOUNDS OF THE CROWD FADE...

OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO...

ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF
a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the
Famous 4th Street deli...

Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.

Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low
voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them,
entering Andrew's room, he hears:

                              DR. GILLMAN
                    ... if he comes out of the
                    hospital this time, you mustn't
                    expect him to be like he was
                    before...

Joe steps into...

ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...

A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:
"Victory."

OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a
hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.

JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand,
smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free
hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an
amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various
parts of his body.)

Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.
JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while
Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering
the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.

As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags
from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.

People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and
happiness evident in the room.

ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling
eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.

ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.

Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he
wants Joe to sit there.

Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.

With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His
voice is raspy, weak:

                              ANDREW
                    What do you call a thousand lawyers
                    chained together at the bottom of the
                    ocean?

                              JOE
                    What?

                              ANDREW
                    A good start.

Joe smiles.

                              ANDREW (CONT.)
                    Excellent work, Joe. I thank
                    you.

                              JOE
                    It was good working with you, Andrew.
                    You're welcome.
                         (sees the oxygen mask)
                    Hey. Shouldn't you put
                    that thing back on?

Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are
weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.

                              JOE (CONT.)
                    I better get home. Lisa and I
                    are having some friends over.

                              ANDREW
                         (muffled by the mask)
                    Sure thing.

Joe stands.

                              JOE
                    I'll see you, Beckett.

Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes
are dancing.

                              ANDREW
                         (through mask)
                    Thanks for coming by.

                              JOE
                    You bet. We'll see you later.

Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.

                              JOE
                         (to Miguel)
                    He's looking good. I wouldn't
                    be surprised if he gets out of
                    here soon.

                              MIGUEL
                    We just want to get him home.
                    Thanks for stopping by, Joe.

Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps
Miguel's back.

                              JOE
                    Night.

Joe leaves.

Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:

                              MIGUEL
                    He's tired. He ought to sleep.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND
saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:

                              JOE
                    What do you call a thousand
                    lawyers chained together at
                    the bottom of the ocean?

The elevator doors close.

                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM...

Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.

                              MATT
                    Night, Andy. See you tomorrow,
                    buddy.

Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.

                              REV. JIM
                    God bless you, Andy.

Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.

                              BUD
                    Goodnight, son.
                    Get some rest, okay?

Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.

                              SARAH
                    Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...

Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug
his brother. He begins to sob.

                              RANDY
                    Andy.

Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected,
around his brother Randy, to comfort him.

                              ANDREW
                         (through mask)
                    I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.

Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room.
Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.

Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.

Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the
remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV.

Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:

                              ANDREW
                    I'm ready...

                              MIGUEL
                    Ready for what, baby?

                              ANDREW
                    Whatever.

                              MIGUEL
                    I hope you're ready for "Studs,"
                    because that's what's on.

Andrew replaces the oxygen mask.

They lie next to each other, watching television.

                                        FADE OUT/FADE IN:

EXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING...

From inside the house: the phone rings.

                                                  CUT TO:

JOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ...

Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone.

Joe is just waking up.

                              LISA
                         (to Joe)
                    It's Miguel.

Joe sits bolt upright.

                              JOE
                    Miguel?

                                                  CUT TO:

EXTERIOR: ANDREW AND MIGUEL'S LOFT BUILDING, DAY.

A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE
step out.

                                                  CUT TO:

RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY
on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have
just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...

A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories
about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying
as they hug each other.

Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew
at various stages of his life, and things that meant something
to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his
favorite cat, etc.

THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the
music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when
Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)

Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.

Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises,
extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his
head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for
an embrace.

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR
SOMETHING...

CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND
WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...

AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the
images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...

THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...

Andrew...

Riding a bike with training wheels...

Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...

AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC
FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still
crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...

We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...

Andrew SHOUTING GLEEFULLY as he chases a new puppy...

Andrew SQUEALING as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool...

Andrew on a swing, going higher and higher...

And laughing.

FADE TO BLACK.

ROLL END CREDITS.



May we never find space so vast, 
planets so cold, heart 
and mind so empty 
that we cannot fill them 
with love and warmth...
