John Merrick (whose real name was Joseph, as this is based on a true story) is an intelligent and friendly man, but he is hated by his Victorian-era English society because he is severely deformed.
Once he is discovered by a doctor, however, he is saved from his life in a freak show and he is treated like the human being that he really is.
