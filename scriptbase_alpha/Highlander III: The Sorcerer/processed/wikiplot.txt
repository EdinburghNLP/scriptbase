16th century

Some time after the death of his wife Heather, Connor travels to Japan to request training from the Immortal Japanese sorcerer Nakano.
Nakano holds his residence in a cave of Mount Niri, and has gained a reputation as a master of Illusion.
However, another Immortal named Kane is also interested in mastering the power of Illusion.
He is making his way across Asia in order to reach Nakano again, with two henchmen in tow (Khabul Khan and Senghi Khan).
Entering a nearby village seeking information, they proceed to burn it to the ground, and massacre its population.
Eventually, they reach the cave.
Kane soon defeats and decapitates Nakano, despite Connor's attempts to prevent this.
However, the energies released during the Quickening cause the cave to collapse.
The Highlander manages to escape in time, but Kane and his men are left trapped inside the depths of the mountain.
Their situation prevents them from participating in "The Gathering" of 1985.

18th century

In 1788/1789, Connor was in France, where he makes the acquaintance of Sarah Barrington, an Englishwoman visiting relatives there, and who happens to resemble the future Alex Johnson.
The two eventually become lovers.
However, when the French Revolution begins, MacLeod becomes involved.

MacLeod is captured, and sentenced to death by guillotine for treason against King Louis XVI of France.
His Immortal friend Pierre Bouchet explains that he was tired of his immortal life, and dupes the guards into executing him in his place.
Connor is falsely reported deceased.
Believing her lover dead, Sarah is left grieving.
After his escape, MacLeod returns to discover that she has moved on with her life by marrying another man, and having children.

Modern day

In 1994, Connor is living with his adopted son John in Marrakesh.
It is revealed that in 1987, Brenda Wyatt, the woman he married after the Gathering, was killed in a car accident.
Although he survived the accident himself, he still believes that "The Game" is over.
Meanwhile, in Japan, two archaeologists have started excavating a cave in order to discover whether the legend of the sorcerer Nakano was based on fact.
One of these archaeologists is Dr. Alexandra Johnson, whose interests in the legend eventually lead her to Connor MacLeod.
Connor is intrigued by Alex due to her resemblance to Sarah.

The excavations free Kane, who immediately sets out in pursuit of Connor.
MacLeod leaves John in the care of his friend Jack Donovan, and then departs to New York City to engage in the final showdown for the Prize.
However, as Khabul's decapitated body is found in a hospital washroom, Lt. John Stenn goes on the trail of the main suspect of the 1985 "headhunter" case, Russell Nash.
Russell Nash was the alias used by MacLeod during the time of the Gathering.
As Alex investigates a piece of cloth found on the site, she discovers that it is a shred of a kilt, with a design that designates a branch of the MacLeod family.
This leads her to Nash Antiques, where Connor has returned in preparation for the battle against Kane.
The Highlander is confronted on Holy Ground at a former Buddhist shrine by Kane, who proceeds to challenge him.
The resulting fight is a violation of the Immortal Golden Rule; the battle ends when MacLeod's katana blade is shattered.
Kane flees, and Connor decides to return to the Scottish Highlands to build another sword though his initial attempts are unsuccessful.

Alex tracks him down to give him a bar of finely refined steel that she found in Nakano's cave with which he is able to forge a new sword, and the two then become lovers.
However, the trip is cut short, as MacLeod learns from Jack Donovan that his son John is on a plane bound for New York.
MacLeod returns as quickly as possible, but he's too late.
Kane abducts John, and holds him hostage to lure MacLeod to him.
MacLeod meets Kane in an old church mission in Jersey City, NJ, and then follows him into an abandoned power plant for their final battle.
The Highlander defeats Kane, wins the Prize by receiving the final Quickening, and returns to Scotland with Alex and John to live out the rest of his natural life.
