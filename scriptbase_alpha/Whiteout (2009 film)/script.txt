          SCROLL OVER BLACK:
          
          Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice.    The
          coldest place on earth.
          
          Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain
          outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in
          check.
          
          There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S.
          Marshal is assigned to the territory.

          EXT.   ANTARCTICA - DAY
          
          Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
          wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
          
          CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
          peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
          of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
          ice.
          
          STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
          crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
          stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage
          beauty, then...
          
          THUD!!!
          
          A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
          gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface
          with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
          out --
          
          -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
          It's a man.
          
          Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
          snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
          -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
          spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
          startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
          
          We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
          shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
          PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
          white.

          The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades
          us like a rhythmic lullaby.
          
          -- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand.    The
          shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.
          
          Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an
          ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly
          applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic
          calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --
          
          O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door.
          
          The hands stop.
          
          Another KNOCK KNOCK.
          
          The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt
          halt.
          
                                     WOMAN (O.C.)
                            (slightly annoyed)
                       ...Yeah?
          
          Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --
          rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but
          she's not at the beach.
          
          In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
          OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
          above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm
          tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the
          earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
          
          The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
          (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel
          shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the
          intrusion.
          
                                     JAMIE
                       Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein
                       needs to see you in biology. Said
                       it's urgent.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Alright --
          
          Jamie leaves.
          
          As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,
          panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes
          lay strewn about the floor.

          A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has
          been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN
          unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
          space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
          beach.
          
          A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized
          with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy-
          striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by
          international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing
          next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with
          SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his
          face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT.   MCMURDO STATION - ANTARCTICA - DAY
          
          An ugly sprawl of prefab buildings, power-lines and above
          ground sewage pipes. It looks more like a Siberian work
          camp than Antarctica's largest research base and
          logistics hub. In the background, smoke rises from Mt.
          Erebus.

          An icy wind HOWLS, but the base swarms with PARKA-CLAD
          FIGURES shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for
          winter.
          
          We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the
          icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not
          enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and
          checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS -
          BERKLEY...until she reaches BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 and
          pushes through the double doors into...

          LONG BENCHES are covered with ANTARCTIC FLORA - MOSSES,
          LICHENS and LIVERWORTS. They are being nurtured and
          studied by SCIENTISTS who look like homeless people -
          unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin.
          
          Carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket.
          Approaches one of the scientists with familiarity, who is
          in the process of EXTRACTING an ICE-CORE SAMPLE from a
          stainless steel cylinder.

          He indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall
          grass samples across the room. PROFESSOR SAPPERSTEIN,
          young, thin and bearded, is studying them.

                                        SAPPERSTEIN
                       Yeah.

                       Wanted to see me?
          
          His face tenses -- this is serious.
          
                                        SAPPERSTEIN
                       -- Follow me.
          
          He leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a
          GLASS HERBARIUM containing only STALKS and a few HEAT
          LAMPS. One of the GLASS PANELS has been smashed.

                    It was just budding, too.
          
          He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy-
          eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato
          chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. Stifling laughter.

          Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Professor Sapperstein, I'd like
                    you to read something for me.
          
          She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her
          neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face.

          He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie

          Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is
          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --
          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right
          temple.
          
          She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is
          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.
          
          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of
          empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:
          None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with
          "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
          
          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.
          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.
          Just stares unhappily at the binder.
          
          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
          cardboard tiles.
          
          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a
          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform
          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other
          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday
          cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,
          sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

          CONTINUED:
          
          As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a
          nearby box --
          
                                      MURPHY (O.C.)
                       You busy?
          
          She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on
          the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       What do you think?
                            (BEAT)
                       I know you weren't in the area.
                       What's up?
          
          He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to
          it.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he
                       spotted a popsicle out on the ice.
          
                                      CARRIE
                       What flavor?
          
                                      MURPHY
                       Don't know.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       And we were doing so well.

          This throws her.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       McClain Valley? What was he doing
                       out there? That's no man's land.
          
          He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems
          amused.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I've got a plane heading to ASB in
                       an hour with some supplies for
                       Winter-over.

          Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the
          base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen
          specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings
          raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular
          shaped walkways.
          
          Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,
          pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE
          BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both
          sides of the runway.
          
          Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she
          deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the
          other side of the plane.
          
          The main ASB complex is before her.
          
          Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS
          TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are
          everywhere.
          
          Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks
          blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around
          the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.
          
          Carrie heads in --

          INT.   ASB - CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          Music cranks. Carrie knows her way. People come and go
          as she strides along a corridor decorated with PARTY
          BALLOONS and signs that read: `DON'T FORGET THE EVE OF
          EVAC PARTY' -- comes to an office door with a small
          plaque on it that reads: MARSHAL. Pushes it open.
          
          
          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. It's smaller than her McMurdo office with
          a HOLDING ROOM that has a viewing window in the door. A
          fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer
          and lamp on top.
          
          A map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub-
          station positions marked in block letters. A window
          gives view to the South Pole.
          
          
          INT. SMALL ROOM - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie opens the door. Single bed. Tiny dresser. No
          frills. She tosses her gear bag onto the bed. Closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY
          
          Carrie pokes her head in. An examination table, cabinets
          with drugs and first aid equipment. A couple of hospital
          beds. Moving boxes are packed up.
          
                                   CARRIE
                     Doc?
          
          Another door in the back of the room is open, but the
          light is off. Carrie turns to leave and --

          outside, Aussie RUSSELL KELLER (late 20's) coming down
          the corridor. He's naked, except for a towel wrapped
          around his waste. Sports a goatee. Couple tats.
          Flashes a cocky smile.
          
                                   KELLER
                     Well, hello Marshal.

                       It's his first year down here.
                       You know how that goes. My bet it
                       was just debris, an old tent or
                       something.

                       Here's an idea -- why don't you
                       stay here with me and we'll party,
                       just the two of us. Put those

          INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - ASB
          
          A large room by base standards. Several windows. A
          giant map of ANTARCTICA dominates one wall with the
          International stations and research outposts flagged with
          pins that have their countries flags on them.   A grid of
          EVAC TIMES of each STATION and OUTPOST is next to it. A
          Tech is changing a few.
          
          Another TECH sits as a console, lined with comm equipment
          and computers. Others hustle about.
          
          Talking into a headset is the Station Manager, RHONDA
          STEWART (30's). Silky white skin. Irish. Long red hair
          tied back. Perfunctory.

                                  RHONDA
                    Good, have them check all the
                    pressure levels on the hydraulics,
                    then clear the exterior storage
                    bins. Make sure we're not leaving
                    anything out there.
          
          Rhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway. There's a
          flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional
          demeanor.

                                  RHONDA

          years of Antarctic service.

                       for six months.
          
          Camera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers);

                       they freeze. Some curl up. Some
                       stretch out. Some tear their

                       Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We
                       can't find him, but we hear him on
                       the radio going on and on about
                       the Serengeti heat and his wife,

                       his bunny boots.

          more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The
          second it hits the wall --
          
          THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
          
          Carrie's beat to shit, soul weary. She's on her knees,
          full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds
          before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead.
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Carrie refocuses.   Pulls away from the wall.    Leaves the
          memory behind.
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - LATER
          
          Carrie has a NEXTEL phone/walkie to her ear, making her
          way up the corridor. Moves past a couple of guys loading
          a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room.

          She hangs up. Approaches a closed door.      Name plate on
          it reads Dinkle -- SUB-STATIONS MANAGER.
          
          O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her
          eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning
          continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the
          door to see --
          
          -- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a
          quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader
          with no top. Half a dozen guys, oblivious to Carrie
          standing there, CHEER the action.

          standing behind them. Only fake PORNO MOANING remains.

          Everyone gets up, thrilled for an excuse to leave.       One
          of them nods to Carrie on the way out.

          Carrie flips a nearby wall switch. Lights kick on.
          Small room. English flag. There's a Beckham poster and
          an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one
          wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.
          
          A proud assortment of tea bags are uniformly lined up
          along a shelf.
          
          One guy remains. HOWARD DINKLE.        Thirties.   English.
          Bearded. On the heavy side.

                       Am I in some kind of trouble?
          
          As he crosses to her, he flips the 8x10 framed photo back
          around -- it's of THE QUEEN MOTHER.
          
          
          INT. DINKLE'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

          Widen.   Carrie opens it.
          
          Three photos are stapled inside. One is of Weiss, the
          other two have names written under them -- RUBIN and
          MOONEY. Mooney is a runty looking guy with a mop of
          blond hair. Rubin is a skinny, thin faced young guy with
          a beard that hasn't filled in yet.

                       I need a plane to Vostok.
          
          Rhonda raises her finger -- putting her on hold.      Carrie
          doesn't like it.
          
                                     RHONDA

                       want to stay the winter, then
                       don't be ready for your evac.
          
          She looks to Carrie --

                       Sorry, can't.    All the planes are

                       picked up in four and a half?

                       Tell them I took their plane.
          
          Carrie spins.    Leaves.

          Squat Soviet-ugly buildings, some collapsing, others with
          boarded up windows, are barely visible through the
          driving ice.
          
          STORM LINES of different colors interconnect all the
          buildings.
          
          Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into
          the wind, making their way towards the compound. She's
          carrying a duffle bag. Can barely see the Twin Otter
          behind them.

          Carrie leads the way up a decrepit, dimly-lit hall strung
          with exposed pipes and wiring.
          
          Gaunt, malnourished faces look up from the rooms they
          pass. All stare. Silently. Looks more like death row.

                       The Russians barely supply Vostok
                       anymore. They have to barter with
                       other bases for supplies. Some of
                       these guys have been rotting here
                       for years.

          Carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it
          out of the 70's: ancient computers and steel-cased radios
          fill one wall.
          
          One man welds equipment off to the side. Four more
          Russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking Vodka.
          
          They all take their time looking her over.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Who's in charge?
          
          YURI, a big bear of a man in his forties, gets up from
          the table. Huge arms. Scruffy face. Bloodshot eyes.
          
                                  YURI
                         (heavy accent)
                    Who's asking?
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Stetko, US Marshal. I'm here to
                    talk to an American named Mooney.
          
          Yuri smiles.
          
                                  YURI
                    So many people come through
                    Vostok. Is hard to remember.
          
                                   CARRIE
                    I figured.
          
          Carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it.
          
          Yuri pulls it open. It's packed with steaks. The
          Russians react with smiles and the mood lightens. Yuri's
          grin widens further. Takes out a porno -- there's a
          Cheerleader on the cover.
          
                                  YURI
                    Mister Mooney, yes. I remember
                    now. He offers pay us to fly him
                    off Antarctica on our transport.
                    We give him very good price -
                    because plane leaves a week ago!
          
          The Russians laugh.

          Carrie is suiting up in her ECW gear, rope harness and
          crampons. Her jacket's open. Delfy has a steaming cup
          of coffee in his hand. He looks to her gear belt; cuffs,
          pepper spray, baton...
          
                                     DELFY
                       You don't carry a gun?

                       Against the law -- Antarctica's
                       the only place in the world you
                       can't have one. Part of the
                       Treaty.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Doesn't that make you feel kind of
                       naked?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       All this crap on -- I prefer
                       naked.
          
          She zips up her jacket.    He glances to a temp readout by
          the door.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Gettin' worse. Minus eighty-one.
                       Wind at a hundred and ten knots.
          
          He takes a sip from his hot coffee.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Do you have to do that in front of
                       me?
          
          He sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs
          to be fastened.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Give you a hand?

                       Sure.
          
          Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens
          it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They
          finish at the same time.

                       Yeah, hold on tight.
          
          Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel-
          lock in the center of the door.
          
          WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp,
          slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her
          back.
          
          The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall
          of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.
          
          CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in
          half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls
          across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
          
          Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot
          tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to
          the side of the building.
          
          She steps into the storm.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking
          the wheel.
          
          Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is
          gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide
          line and the ROAR of the storm.
          
          A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by
          her tether and smacked down on the ice.
          
          Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally
          Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to
          realize she's at a building.
          
          She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening
          the door.
          
                                                                  34.

          Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the
          HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are
          chattering.
          
          She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the
          ready room into the building.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a
          sliver of light stabbing in through a window.

                    Mooney? Hello?
          
          Only silence responds.
          
          The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in
          both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket.
          Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.
          
          Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from
          her belt. She decides to go left.
          
          Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one
          gives.
          
                                   CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Mooney?
          
          She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an
          empty room.
          
          Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like
          someone trying to clear their throat.
          
          Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a
          closed door at the end of the hall.
          
          It's confirmed when she hears it again.
          
          Stops at the door.
          
          She slowly opens it --
          
          Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --

          CONTINUED:
          
          -- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge
          type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned
          sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's
          coming from. Another cough.
          
          She enters the room.
          
          
          INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to
          see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood.
          Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his
          esophagus.

                       ...My God.
          
          She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING
          for air, trying to tell her something.
          
          Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his
          eyes -- someone's coming at her.
          
          -- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --
          WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her
          head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the
          baton that goes clattering across the floor.
          
          The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes
          another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her,
          but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.
          
          Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the
          baton, but can't see it.
          
          The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts
          around the sofa, heading back out the door.

          Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run,
          retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer
          emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be
          close.
          
          Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the
          Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's
          right behind.
          
          She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light
          getting smaller and smaller as she nears.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets there.   Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all
          or nothing.   She pulls open the door --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.
          
          SMACK!   The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.
          
          She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock
          on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the
          same time. It's a race.
          
          CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her
          hard.
          
          She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind
          her bursts open.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm
          line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing
          back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses
          sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
          
          She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but
          HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
          
          She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
          materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.    He's
          clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
          
          He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
          ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
          raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
          knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
          
          He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
          She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
          
          The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
          kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
          
          SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
          
          There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.   The killer
          draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.   He swings.
          
          Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND
          grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
          disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.   Grabs
          on.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no
          idea which way to go.
          
          Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the
          blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:
          "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles
          15,641"
          
          She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the
          wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her
          face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
          
          Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.
          A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
          
          Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns
          to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She
          deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab
          the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking
          Carrie's glove with it.
          
          He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
          throwing him off balance.
          
          The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
          ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
          Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
          pendulum.
          
          The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes
          everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly
          struggles up the line.
          
          
          EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS
          
          More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door
          and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
          
          Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around
          the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.
          
          
                                                        (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's
          caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
          
          Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
          
          Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
          
          A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto
          Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself
          in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge
          dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The
          bathroom door behind her is open.
          
          She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the
          room behind her. Body tenses.
          
          As she turns --
          
                                      CARRIE
                       Jack?
          
          No answer.
          
          She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the
          door.
          
          Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM!
          Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the
          other door jam.
          
          Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven,
          grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the
          bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into
          the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She
          drops to the floor --
          
          CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her.
          She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a
          frenzy, like a cat in water.
          
                                      CARRIE (cont'd)

                       Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay.
          
          The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding
          her down.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again.

          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER
          
          She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old,
          WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand
          -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of
          water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the
          florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       What happened?
          
                                       DELFY
                       When   you didn't come back -- we
                       went   looking for you. Found a
                       dead   guy in the other building --
                       that   Mooney?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Yeah. Someone got to him before I
                       did. Then went after me.
                            (BEAT)
                       How long was I out?
          
                                     DELFY
                       A couple hours.
          
          Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her.
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                       He's been looking after you.
          
          He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Thanks.
          
          As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in
          Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling
          something else.
          
          She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers
          are slow moving.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       I need to get back in there.

          Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the
          dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her
          bearings back.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Whoever it was, could have flown
                    out after the storm broke.
          
          They walk a few silent beats, then --
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                    Who's Jack?
          
          It's a moment before she responds --
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Let it go, Delfy.
          
          He lets it go.
          
          THEY ENTER THE LOUNGE
          
          Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa.
          Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the
          blood on the floor.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Until I met you, I hadn't seen any
                    dead people. Now I'm at two.
          
          Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa.
          Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in.
          Retrieves her baton --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal
          vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which
          bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
          
          Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth
          - Shhhhh.
          
          She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but
          it hurts. She shifts it to the other.
          
          She turns off her light.    Delphy does the same.   Motions
          for him to stay put.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her
          back tight to the wall.
          
          Gets to the edge of the door.      It's open just slightly --
          looks in.
          
          Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding
          a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag
          with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been
          completely turned inside out.
          
          She enters.    Baton cocked.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Unless you want your head cracked,
                       I wouldn't move.
          
          His body tenses.

                       Now turn around.
          
          He does. He's a guy in his 30's. Although he's clean
          shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.

                       the time constraints we're up

          pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses
          her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't
          move. She pulls at it...
          
          ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is
          soaked in blood.   No corpse.

          Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is
          next to him with the map and her GPS in hand. She stares
          at a tiny blinking red light on the GPS --

          FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front
          doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the
          entrance.
          
          Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,
          watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by
          two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.
          
          She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the
          door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are
          loading a body under a sheet into the back of their
          truck.

          All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind.      Carrie
          steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too.
          
          Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.    It's
          completely flat. Desert like.

          Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.
          Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,
          she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
          
          Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.
          Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.

          She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now
          paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After
          a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --
          like it's supposed to be.
          
          She turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture.
          Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
          area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
          inches thick --
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       They were digging, Pryce. And
                       they tries to spread the ice to
                       hide it.
          
          She heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon.
          Takes another step forward.
          
          WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
          the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
          covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
          
          Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
          slightly, unsure of their own footing.
          
          Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
          precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
          slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
          of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
          hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but
          darkness.

          Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall
          of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets
          to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
          
          As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls
          on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.
          
          Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath
          her is metal.

          Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
          
          Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens
          easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their

          Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,
          heading for the cockpit.
          
          Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -
          - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -
          - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past
          the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man
          staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's
          dead, pinned between two large metal crates.

          targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie pushes the door open.
          
          The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED
          across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding
          through it.
          
          Continues over three dead men in flight suits still
          strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly
          expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm
          holstered around their waist.
          
                                     DELFY
                       This isn't funny --
          
          She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Where's Pryce?
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb
          through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered
          cargo area.
          
          Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle
          of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of
          supplies.
          
          Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free,
          sniffs, and drinks.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    What is that?
          
          Delfy grins.
          
                                    DELFY
                    Vodka.
          
          Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM
          flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS
          TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.
          
          Spots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead.
          
          Moves to it.
          
                                  CARRIE
                         (SUSPICIOUS)
                    Find what you're looking for?
          
          Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL
          CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And
          inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open.
          
          Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Just answers.
                         (BEAT)
                    Those are fuel tanks behind you.
                    This plane was outfitted for long
                    range capabilities.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    And by the looks of that safe,
                    must've been transporting
                    something pretty important.
          
          Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been
          breached.

          CONTINUED:
          Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
          weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous
          intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools
          litter the floor.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       They put some serious work into
                       this.
          
          There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where
          one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered
          in blood --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Whoever got hurt, they dragged him
                       out of here. There's blood all
                       over the tunnel.
          
          She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe
          more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX
          ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed.
          Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.
          
          The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES.

                       It's the Cat!
          
          CRASH! -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE.

                       Go!
          
          CRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE.
          
          They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight
          beams swinging wildly about the hold.
          
          MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting
          closer to the source.
          
          Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the
          hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely.
          Light fades.

          DISTANT.

                    No signal, you?
          
          Shakes his head no.

          INT. PLANE - AT THE HATCH - LATER
          
          CHIPCHIPCHIP!    Ice is flying.
          
          Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped
          up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard
          at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled
          hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts
          are big-- but the progress minimal.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    This isn't going to work, it's
                    like digging through concrete with
                    a spoon.
                         (BEAT)
                    We're going to suffocate before we
                    get out here.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    How long do you figure we've got?
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Three of us down here -- 12, 15
                    hours at the most.
          
          Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped
          animal.
          
                                  DELFY
                    No way. I'm not going out like
                    this. No way.
          
          The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade.
          Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg,
          trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light
          goes out --
          
          -- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second
          later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it.
          Hands it over to Carrie --

                       screwed.
          
          Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       What about the Vodka -- we could
                       make some torches, maybe melt the
                       ice?

                       What choice do we have?
          
          Pryce knows she's right.
          
          Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.
          
                                     DELFY
                       Don't need my vote.
          
          Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible
          in the dissipating range of light.
          
          Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a
          pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her
          coat.
          
          Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,
          but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.
          Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
          
          Pryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in
          his tracks.
          
          Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS
          attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
          
          He moves to Carrie --

                       Hold these.
          
          He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight.
          
          He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the
          back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the
          dark.

          Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam
          straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the
          fuselage.

                    don't think we're that far from
                    the surface. Give me a hand.
          
          Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over.
          They join, sliding it over below the hatch.
          
          He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    These are explosive bolts. If we
                    blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash
                    a hole up through the ice.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Or, if the ice is too thick the
                    blast will come right back at us.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    We can be blown up, suffocate or
                    freeze to death. Take your pick.
          
          Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch
          area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a
          crisscrossing maze of wires.

                    battery from your phone.
          
          As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over
          her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.

                    When I connect these two wires,
                    hopefully there's going to be a
                    big bang. May want to take some
                    cover.
          
          Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
          onto the battery, and prepares for another.
          
          He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against
          the fuselage.

          Delfy nods.
          
          Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
          head.
          
          Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing
          happens. Hope freezes.
          
          Pryce tries again --
          
          -- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting
          around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
          coming in and out of their light.
          
          SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,
          halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's
          width.
          
          They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of
          ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
          THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
          from God.

                    need to get up higher.
          
          Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it
          over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the
          other.
          
          Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing
          Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.

          She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm
          from the shoulder holster.
          
          Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian

                    Soufian, a black market trader in
                    New York. It was all about
                    setting up a buy for cannisters
                    found in an old Russian transport
                    buried in the ice.

                                  PRYCE
                    There's been rumors for years that
                    the Russians had a second base --
                    a secret weapons research facility
                    under the ice that supposedly blew
                    up in the late sixties -- nothing
                    was ever confirmed.

                    The fact is, before the treaty in
                    `72 they were strip mining all
                    over the place down here -- we
                    believe for uranium and other
                    specialized minerals for weapon's
                    use. It was the Cold War. No one
                    knows half the things the
                    Russian's were up to. This plane
                    could be the link between rumor
                    and truth. And if it is true,
                    what's in those cannisters could
                    be a prelude to another terrorist
                    attack.

          Carrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back

          floor. Makes a decision.

          They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky
          is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.
          The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.
          
          Delfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.   Looks inside the

          Dinkle's pulling a DUFFLE BAG toward them.      Sees Carrie
          and Pryce about to head up some stairs.

          CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The well
          defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE
          oozes dead center. This time we stay there a little
          longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the
          wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera...
          slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot.
          He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck.

          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down.     Then
          slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand.

          He rises. Goes to a medicine cabinet. Selects a pill
          bottle. Shakes it. Only a couple inside. He returns
          with the pill bottle.

                       Should ease the pain. I'll look
                       around, dig some more up for you.
          
          She stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to
          be.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. CARRIE'S BEDROOM - ASB - DAY
          
          Carrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun
          next to it.
          
          She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt,
          but can't button it up with only one hand. Her
          frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of
          emotion that's trying to get out.
          
          She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that
          sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying.
          
          Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears.
          
          After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway
          with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her
          compassionately.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       I stopped by the clinic... Doc
                       told me.
          
          Carrie nods, pulling herself together, swallowing her
          emotion.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Pretty tough Marshal, huh?
          
          He enters.    Holds out her ring for her.

                       really a good time.
          
          He joins her.    Hands over her ring.     Takes a seat next to
          her.

          They sit in silence together for a moment. Carrie sees
          the Russian pistol that's ended up on the floor close by.
          Picks it up. Examines it like a relic.

                       Wasn't supposed to need one down

          She looks at him --

                       You asked what I was running away
                       from...I came down here to forget
                       my partner, Jack. Thought it

                                     CARRIE
                       We were on a stakeout at a Holiday
                       Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy
                       to go down. I was excited, we'd
                       been after this trafficker for a
                       long time. Thought this bust
                       would be my big chance to impress
                       the brass. Anyway, guy's a no
                       show. One hour went by, then two -
                       - nothing.

                    Then Jack starting acting strange.
                    Next thing I knew my face was
                    being rammed into a mirror. My
                    own partner was trying to kill me.
                    Turns out the whole bust was a set
                    up from the start. Jack was dirty,
                    working with the guy we were
                    after.

                    Four years together. I knew
                    things about him that his wife
                    didn't even know.
                    (BEAT)
                    But he was my partner and I killed
                    him that night. There's no
                    changing that.
          
          Pryce takes it all in.   Not the story he expected.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Marshall service cleared me --
                    ruled it self-defense, but I had a
                    real hard time getting over the
                    betrayal -- how little my life
                    meant to a guy I was willing to
                    take a bullet for.
          
          Carrie shifts in her chair.   Leans forward.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Know what the kicker is -- Jack
                    thought I was close to figuring
                    him out. Thought this hotel room
                    was the best place to get rid of
                    me -- make it look like a bust
                    gone bad. Truth is, I had no
                    idea.
                    (ANGRY)
                    God, I was young and stupid, and
                    in way over my head.
          
          She stands.   Pryce joins her.

                    You asked me why I smell like
                    suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis,
                    this cheap after-shave his wife
                    gave him. Some of the guys down
                    here wear it -- suntan lotion is
                    the only thing that keeps me from
                    smelling it.

          She notices the papers he's holding; faxed photos of
          THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANNISTERS WITH RUSSIAN WRITING
          ON THEM.

          He shows them to her.   One-by-one.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    It's what the Russians used to
                    transport weapons grade materials
                    in. They match the dimensions
                    inside the safe. We're looking

                    Langley's thinking it might be

          Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window
          hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on
          the nearby wall --
          
          -- A HAND GRABS HERS --
          
          -- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's
          kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's
          embrace. A knife's brought to her neck.
          
                                      MAN

          He slowly turns her around to face him.
          
          -- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks
          slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin
          flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky,
          frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it
          together as he can barely get the words out...
          
                                     RUBIN
                       -- Did Mooney talk to you? I
                       didn't hear from him -- he was
                       supposed to call me after you
                       talked.

                                     RUBIN
                       And I'm next, I know it.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, you're safe, just put
                       the knife down.
          
          His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a
          little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf
          next to him.

                       Who's after you? Where are the
                       cannisters?
          
          He stares off blankly --
          
                                     RUBIN
                       Weiss didn't want to go through
                       with it. Oh God. How did we let
                       this happen?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Rubin -- I need you to focus for
                       me.
          
          He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes --
          he's trying.
          
          O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door.
          
          Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged
          animal.
          
                                     DOC (O.C.)
                       Carrie, it's Doc -- got those
                       painkillers.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, he's a doctor, he can
                       help you.
          
          It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She
          tries to stop him.
          
          Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair.
          She topples backwards.
          
          He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder
          into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back
          up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out
          of him. Pills all over the floor.

          Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort.
          
          Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin
          disappearing down a set of side stairs.

          Doc nods.
          
          She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip.
          
          AT THE STAIRS
          
          She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way...

                      Rubin's here! He's on the run.
                      Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans.

          BOTTOM OF STAIRS - LEVEL ONE
          
          As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's
          three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to
          the right --
          
          -- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway
          that leads into an INTERCONNECTING TUNNEL to another part
          of ASB.

                      He's heading for the Science Lab.
          
          Carrie kicks it into high --

          tunnel as he dashes through.

          Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as
          Carrie enters. It's lined with several free standing,
          empty bookcases.
          
                                   CARRIE
                    Rubin, wait!
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway.
          Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet.
          Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for
          the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
          
          -- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM.   A sign above reads: READY
          ROOM.
          
          She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab
          stations to get to the door.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF ROOM
          
          Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't
          open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window --
          sees --
          
          -- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack
          mounted to the wall.
          
          A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.
          
          He and Carrie exchange glances.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Rubin -- I can help you!
          
          He shakes his head.
          
          She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the
          window to see he's tied them together with some climbing
          rope.
          
          In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods
          half the room as the outside door is whipped open.
          
          A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing
          a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready
          to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.

          Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and
          Carrie, but --
          
          -- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder,
          gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for
          Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man.
          BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.
          
          Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end
          of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on
          the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - BASE OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.
          Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.
          Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
          can get to his feet.
          
          His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to
          retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so
          tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - SAME
          
          Carrie shoulders the door, but still doesn't budge.
          Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.

                       Door's jammed --
          
          Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with
          beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked
          against one of the lab stations.

                       Pryce, it's not Rubin --
          
          Off his confused look --
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Someone's trying to kill him.
          
          Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it
          like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes
          crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot.
          
          
          INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through
          the open exit door.

          Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are
          vacant. Ice axe is still there.

                       Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear
                       on.
          
          Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes
          for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie
          joins. Same thing.
          
                                     PRYCE

          Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins
          tucked against the base of the main building. The blood
          from his wound already frozen on his shirt.
          
          The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's
          reflection off the ice is blinding.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          RUBIN'S POV -
          
          -- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are
          literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to
          shield them -- has little effect.
          
          He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
          attacker not far behind.
          
          Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
          fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms
          are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --
          pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins
          around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.
          
          Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under
          ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
          his movement.
          
                                                                   81.

          Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues
          toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
          other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing
          filling an insulated container with water from an
          insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is
          parked next to them.
          
          He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice
          escapes...
          
                                   RUBIN
                    ...Help me.
          
          The guys -- oblivious.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
          
          Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room
          and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite
          directions around the complex.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME
          
          Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get
          to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
          container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too
          slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
          
                                   RUBIN
                    W..wa..wait.
          
          He turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet
          away and closing.
          
          Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --
          anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.
          Heads for it.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
          
          Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
          several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --
          through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
          RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the
          main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
          
                                                                   82.

          Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support
          leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.
          Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,
          but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a
          defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
          
          -- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin
          against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -
          - SPRAYING him head to toe.
          
          Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips
          go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff
          steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his
          ice-locked clothing.
          
          The man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP -
          breaks his neck.
          
          Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.

          Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard
          hanging next to the window. Something outside catches
          her attention.
          
                                    RHONDA
                    Sam!
          
          She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
          
          Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see
          Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view
          of the killer.

          The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
          
          -- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.
          Goggles shatter.

          He drops.
          
          Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps
          the goggle from his face.
          
          It's KELLER!
          
          Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
          
          The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of
          him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine
          blade.
          
          Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck
          askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering
          from the impact --
          
                                     KELLER
                       I sh... sh... shoulda killed you
                       at Vostok.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Where are the cannisters?
          
                                       KELLER
                       Go to hell.
          
                                       PRYCE
                       Wrong answer.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Help me drag him over here.
          
          They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
          back over to the Snow Melter.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Keep him still.
          
          She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's
          neck.
          
          Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then
          whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold
          makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Who's Tahir selling it to --
                       what's the intended target?
          
          Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her
          knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing
          bare arms and legs.

                    What're you doing, you crazy
                    bitch?
          
          Keller instantly starts to shake.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Why did you kill those scientists,
                    Keller? Was a four-way split too
                    much for you?
          
                                    KELLER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.
          
          She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him
          with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground
          as it freezes instantly.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Where is the uranium?
          
                                  KELLER
                         (almost smug)
                    You have no idea what's going on
                    here, do you?
          
          Keller begins to shiver violently.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Hit the sonofabitch again!
          
          Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He
          screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
          
                                  KELLER
                    The plane, they're in the fucking
                    plane.
          
          Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy.
          Furious. Two other guys at his side.
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Have you completely lost your
                    mind?
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Let go of me.
          
          She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)

                                  MURPHY
                    What the hell's going on?
          
          She glares at him.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    The cannisters are on the plane.
          
          She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Throw him in the holding cell.
          
          The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the
          ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller
          screams.
          
          The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away.
          
          Murphy looks to Pryce --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Who the hell are you?
          
          Carrie looks at Pryce.
          
                                     PRYCE
                    Name's Pryce.
          
          Pryce looks at Carrie.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's with the UN. We have to
                    search that plane now!
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    We don't have time. We'll just
                    search it in Christchurch when it
                    lands.
          
          Pryce steps in --
          
                                  PRYCE
                    It's a twelve hour flight to
                    Christchurch. Anything can happen
                    in that time. Keller is here, so
                    we know it's still on the ground.

                       give us 10 minutes.
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly --

          INT. LC-130 - DAY
          
          Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of
          seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees
          tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.

                       stuck here.

                       He's buying time.
          
          Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace.

          Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which
          is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the
          evac. Pryce is close behind.
          
                                  CARRIE

          INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Pryce at her side. Her face goes white.
          The door to the holding room is wide open. Keller's

          Then it hits her --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    He won't try.    He's a goddamn
                    pilot.

          Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit.
          Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined
          up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He
          heads toward an Otter.

          Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is
          still hanging on the console. Then, something catches
          his attention through the windshield of his plane. He
          sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's
          pumping.
          
          Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the
          hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane.
          Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a
          another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.

          Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and --
          
          THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the
          head.   Stumbles back.
          
          Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
          
          Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool
          chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap.
          Unconscious.

          Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into

          Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat.
          Plane is nearly full.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER
          
          Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the
          console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees
          Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.
          
          
          CARRIE AND PRYCE
          
          Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They
          stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any
          betrayal of movement.
          
          Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast.
          Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a
          duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions
          for him to go one way, she'll go another.
          
          INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE
          Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open.
          She heads for it. Gun poised.
          
          Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every
          dark corner.
          
          Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door.
          Inside's empty.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots
          Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks
          like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
          
          SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in
          his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying.
          Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers.
          Keller kicks him hard.
          
          Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun.
          
          Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --
          
          BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover
          behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.
          
          Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires
          continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots
          go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right
          hand.
          
          Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots
          back, which --
          
          -- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover
          beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.
          
          Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.
          They stop. Carrie has to reload.
          
          Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for
          his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button
          attached to it. Slams it.
          
          HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN
          
          The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter
          is let inside.
          
          Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into
          the idling Otter.
          
          Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.
          
          Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate --
          glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.
          
          Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward
          toward the opening doors.
          
          Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet.
          Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual
          once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce.
          He's bleeding profusely.
          
          She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of
          his chest.
          
          Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    ...I didn't see him.
          
          His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    No!    You stay awake!
          
          Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure.
          Blood continues to ooze.
          
          She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the
          hangar.
          
          Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Damn it!
                         (to Delfy)
                    Come on. We're getting him up.
          
          They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the
          hangar the best they can. Go outside.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the
          ground.
          
          Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the
          bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Press here.    Hard. Hard or he
                    will die!
          
                                     DELFY
                    It won't stop!
          
          Looks Delfy right in the eye.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's not going to be number four!

          Pryce moans.
          
          Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
          
          Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it
          around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
          
          She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane
          moving toward the runway.
          
          The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.
          
                                     PRYCE
                            (GASPING)
                       What are you doing?   Get Keller.
          
          She holds him down.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       You're bleeding out. Freezing
                       drops your pulse. We have to slow
                       it down.
                            (BEAT)
                       You hold on.
          
          Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick
          draw. Keys it.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet?

                                     CARRIE
                       Keller got out. He hurt Pryce --
                       he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc?
          
                                     MURPHY (V.O.)
                       In the clinic. About to bring the
                       bodies out. What's --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Tell him to stay put, and I need
                       your help getting Pryce there.
                       We're at the hangar. I've got to
                       stop Keller, he's got the
                       cannisters.
          
          Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the two-
          way.

                    Don't let him die.
          
          Carrie stands.   Determined.   Sprints back into the
          hangar.
          
          
          INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles.
          Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on
          one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood
          starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles
          up, then guns it.
          
          Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across
          the cement floor and out the hangar.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of
          the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the
          wind.
          
          Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her
          light as she races in.
          
          
          INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his
          guys as they head toward her. She doesn't even slow down
          as she blows right by them.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. KELLER'S PLANE - SAME
          
          Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto
          the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he
          gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads
          down his strip of freedom.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. SIDE OF RUNWAY - OPPOSITE END - SAME
          
          A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before
          Carrie on the snowmobile.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of
          the berms and onto the runway.   Heads straight for the
          lights of Keller's plane.
          
          
          INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE
          
          He sees Carrie.
          
                                      KELLER
                       Crazy bitch.
          
          INTERCUT:
          
          She targets him like a Japanese zero.       Hundred yards and
          closing.
          
          He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between
          them.
          
          Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards.
          
          Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly
          swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
          
          INSIDE WITH KELLER
          
          He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get
          airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is
          Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue
          right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she
          tumbles down the berm.
          
          Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at
          him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
          
                                                             SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
          
          Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches
          the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel
          of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
          
          -- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
          
          Resume -
          
          Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting
          off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold
          and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
          
          AT THE WRECKAGE

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on
          the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.
          The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
          
          Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.
          In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
          
          Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the
          runway.
          
          Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival
          gear.

          Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce
          in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the
          BODYBAGS onto a cart.

          Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two
          follow. Curious.
          
          Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's
          face, ashen.

                       Get him on the table!
          
          They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has
          his hand on Pryce's wound.

          Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys --
          
                                     DOC
                       You, four units O-pos in the
                       warmer. Second shelf, fridge.
          
          The guy heads for it.
          
          Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks
          when she sees Pryce.

                       Keller hit him with an ice axe.
          
                                        MURPHY
                       He get away?
          
                                        CARRIE
                       No.
          
          Murphy's walkie on his hip CRACKLES to life.

          Rhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot,
          watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming
          at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her
          lips...
          
                                     RHONDA
                       Sam, it's Rhonda -- we gotta go.
                       Now.
                                       MURPHY (V.O.)
                       I know.    I know.

          Murphy looks to Doc.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       Can you do this on the plane?
                       It's your call, but I need to know
                       now.
          
          Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to
          Carrie -- she sees the answer's no.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       I'll stay with you --

                            (to his guys)
                       Grab the bodies and get them on
                       the plane.

          The guys head for the back --
          
          As Doc looks at Pryce -- knowing he needs him...
          
                                     DOC
                       Leave the bodies -- you don't have
                       time. Dead is dead.
                            (BEAT)
                       Pick them up in six months. Go.
          
          Doc looks to Carrie, who's thankful --
          
                                      CARRIE
                       I'm sorry.
          
          The guys after the bodies look to Murphy for a decision.
          
                                      MURPHY
                       Leave'm.   Let's go.
          
          Murphy and Carrie exchange a quick look -- closure.
          
                                      CARRIE
                       Thanks.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       Take care of yourself.
          
          He takes off with the others.
          
          
          EXT. LC - 130 - RIGHT AFTER
          
          The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men
          are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the
          storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the
          second.    He realizes they might not make it.
          
          
          EXT. RUNWAY - ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          The LC-130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the
          runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets
          swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a
          skier.
          
          Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere
          in sight, until --
          
          The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --
          AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that
          the sun is just about to set.

          Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination
          table. He's been bandaged up. Eyes closed. Looks
          thrashed. An IV drip hangs from a stand on wheels.
          
          She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been
          through a lot. He slowly opens his. Tries to smile, not
          easy.
          
                                   PRYCE

                    Hey back.

          She shakes her head --
          
                                   CARRIE
                    Nope.
          
          They both think on it for a moment.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    What did we miss? Think Keller
                    cut and run without the stuff?
          
                                  CARRIE
                    After all this, no way. Keller
                    didn't have it on the plane
                    because he's got it hidden
                    somewhere.
                     (BEAT)
                    Where would he hide something for
                    six months. Somewhere he could be
                    sure no one would ever look.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    If he had made it out, he wouldn't
                    have been crazy enough to come
                    back for it.

                       plan...
          
          Pryce thinks hard -- he's got nothing.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       We've got six months to figure it
                       out.
          
          A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their
          attention. It's Doc coming through with the cart -- a
          bodybag on top.
          
                                     DOC
                       Eyes open -- that's always a good
                       sign.
          
          He continues pushing the gurney toward them --
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Hey, Doc -- thanks.
          
                                      DOC
                       Thank her -- if she hadn't slowed
                       your bleeding.
          
          Doc rolls the gurney behind her --
          
                                     DOC (cont'd)
                       I'm going to hunt me down a bottle
                       of scotch --
          
          Carrie turns, looks at Doc as he wheels the gurney by.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Need any help?

                       I'm good.
          
          She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something
          disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG
          pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is
          clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF
          STITCHES running down the side.

          His voice pulls her focus.          She masks her startle...

          Doc continues on out the door.
          
          Pryce sees that she's bothered --

          INT. CONNECTING TUNNEL TO SCIENCE BUILDING - LATER
          
          Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where
          she chased Rubin.
          
          Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining
          daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run
          along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black.
          WINTER HAS SET IN.
          
          She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers
          through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.
          
          Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay
          tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the
          door.
          
          She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end.
          Disappears into the science building.
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab
          stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room.
          Heads for the freezer.
          
          
          INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her
          light.

          CONTINUED:
          Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
          walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,
          Rubin, Weiss and Keller.
          
          Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to
          unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a
          plastic cinch.
          
          Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth
          as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.
          
          Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She
          rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her
          like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center
          stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep
          gash tight together.
          
          She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself.
          Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc
          lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on
          the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of
          Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's
          run out from under his armpit.

                       Someplace no one would ever think
                       to look.
          
          She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches.
          
          She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM
          OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She
          reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the
          bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE
          CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like
          THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
          
          She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her
          hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.
          Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's
          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT
          LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until
          she shines her light on it --
          
          The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core
          sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the
          other two bodies.
          
          She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more
          cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same
          thing.
          
          Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

                    I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's
                    at least 5 million in diamonds in
                    there. That can buy both of us a
                    nice life back in the world. How
                    many times have we both talked
                    about having a fresh start. Well,
                    this is it. Those beakers finding
                    that plane was a sign. A sign
