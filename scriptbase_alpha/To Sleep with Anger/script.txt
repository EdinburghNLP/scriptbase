To Sleep With Anger 



INT. ROOM - DAY  (EFX)

GIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a
table. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted
tablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is
dressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished
wing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two
points of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed
in flames.

The flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth
to the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes
BURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head
falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He
twiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his
legs as if to get comfortable.

The camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The
image of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the
flames fade; the background changes as we

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY

Gideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon
is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible
resting in his hands.

His house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South
Central Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in
the yard. Chickens scratch around.

He slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around
and sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with
some relief.

SUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching
him from the back window of the house. He leaves the window.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

DOLLY SHOT OF SUNNY

Sunny peeps in the workroom. Through the crack in the door, a
Woman waves to Sunny. 

INT. WORKROOM - DAY

The room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their
husbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a
picture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before
the class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to
leave.

               SUZIE 
     Remember, especially you men, that
     working together now will already
     have formed a bond before the child
     arrives. The woman is very
     sensitive.

Somewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out.

               VOICE (O.S.) 
     Tell me about it.

There is a bit of LAUGHTER as all start putting away their
things.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Gideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the
garden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his
shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house.
Entering the house, he stops and waits inside the door
peeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to
himself.

               GIDEON 
     Spoiling the little foxes that
     spoil my vines.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 

Shot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and
suspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence,
look around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree.

Gideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep
voice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree,
trapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try
to scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with
water. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap
the fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off
his hands. He is quite pleased with himself.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

One of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside
the house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in
single file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree.
They let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie
looks at the picture before reading the letter.
She tries to find a place for it among the other baby
pictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon
comes in and starts to undress.

               GIDEON 
     My mind plays tricks on me. Is it
     okay if I take a bath now?

               SUZIE 
     Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the
     bathroom.

RHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of
the bathroom.

               GIDEON 
     I was looking through my trunk and
     I can't find my toby.

               RHONDA 
     What's that?

               GIDEON 
     It is a charm that my great
     grandmother made me.

Everyone notices the worried look on Gideon's face.

               SUZIE 
     It will show up.

               RHONDA 
     If my daddy calls, tell him I
     walked home.

               SUZIE 
     You be careful and thank you for
     looking after Sunny.

Sunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to
fall out of his hand.

               GIDEON 
     Babe Brother and his wife are
     taking advantage of a situation. I
     hate to be mean to people but
     picking Sunny up when they feel
     like it has to come to an end. Now
     I'm going to ask him how come he
     couldn't be at your birthday.

               SUZIE 
     Don't bother the poor boy. It just
     takes some people a little longer
     to figure out who they are.

               GIDEON 
     I don't know how two brothers can
     be so different.

EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY

SKIP BAKER, who is thirteen, crawls out of his pigeon cage,
holding two birds that he throws up in the air. He climbs
upon the garage roof and throws rocks at the birds to keep
them flying. He WHISTLES and YELLS at them.

CLOSE UP OF BIRDS FLYING

As the birds circle Skip's house, they do backward rolls and
death grips. Skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. The
rocks land on Gideon's roof.

The SOUND of a person trying to learn how to play a TRUMPET
breaks the pleasant SOUNDS of the pigeons popping their wings
and flying in circles over the house.

INT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE, RODNEY'S BEDROOM - DAY

RODNEY BAKER is about nine. He stands next to a shaded
window, trying to finger the right valves on his trumpet. He
tries to hit a high note, but only succeeds in making an
awful screeching sound.

EXT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE - DAY

A group of kids walking by Rodney's window shout insulting
things about his horn playing.

               KIDS 
     Shut up! Go help your mama wash
     dishes!

INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor.
The SCREECHING SOUND of the trumpet from next door is
interrupted by the doorbell. Suzie cannot decide on what to
do, to clean the egg up or answer the door. The doorbell
keeps RINGING.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

Two uniformed Police Officers stand impatiently at the door.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Suzie invites OFFICER SCOTT and OFFICER DAVIS in. Both men
are white and are in their mid-twenties. Officer Davis does
most of the questioning.

               DAVIS 
     We have a complaint from one of
     your neighbors about a rooster
     crowing in the mornings.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Gideon is shaving with a straight razor and humming to
himself, obviously in a good mood. Suzie sticks her head in.

               SUZIE 
     The police are here to talk to you
     about the chickens.

The good mood that Gideon was in dissolves quickly. Gideon
wipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down. Suzie
leaves. Gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Gideon comes in, still adjusting his bathrobe.

               GIDEON 
     What can I do for you, Officer?

Suzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor.
Officer Scott keeps her in view.

               DAVIS 
     You know it is against the city
     ordinance to keep chickens or live
     stock.

               GIDEON 
     I always had chickens, ducks and
     whatnots.

               DAVIS 
     Not anymore, not in the city.

               GIDEON 
     We grow most of our own food. The
     money I get from social security,
     my pension and my wife's work,
     keeps us living on the edge. What
     choice do people like us have.

               DAVIS 
     Well, you just have to move further
     out.

               GIDEON 
     Now how far would further out be?

               DAVIS 
     I'm not here to argue, sir.

               SCOTT 
     You guys don't make anything
     illegal, do you?

               GIDEON 
     Like what may I ask?

               SCOTT 
     You might have a distillery pumping
     out barrels of moonshine.

Suzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen.
Gideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the
confrontation.

               DAVIS 
     Look, just get rid of the chickens
     and you all have a nice day.

Gideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the
steps.

               GIDEON 
     I'll be damned if I get rid of my
     chickens. I ought to get some hogs
     and put them out there.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

There is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing
a robe.

               SUZIE 
     Who is it?

               BABE BROTHER (V.O.) 
     Babe Brother.

Suzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son,
about 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in,
beating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I was hoping you came to the door
     instead of him. It gets cold at
     night.

               SUZIE 
     This doesn't make any sense; you
     are going to drag that poor boy out
     in the cold air.

               BABE BROTHER 
     He will be alright.

The camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room
where Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Suzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is
sleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up
in.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Thanks for taking care of him. I
     will try not to be so long next
     time.

Babe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes
to the door.

               GIDEON 
     What time is it? Do you think you
     can just treat us like your slave?
     It's after one.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I tried to call to let you know I
     was going to be late.

               GIDEON 
     That's a lie.

               SUZIE 
     Let us settle this tomorrow.

               GIDEON 
     Look! Don't try to get ahead by
     riding our backs.

               BABE BROTHER 
          (shouts)
     I pay my own way.

               GIDEON 
     Since when?

He reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them.

               SUZIE 
     Take Sunny home, please.

She pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away,
staring back at his father.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

Gideon is lying in bed. Suzie gets in beside him.

               GIDEON 
     Your feet are cold.

               SUZIE 
     Go back to sleep.

               GIDEON 
     I asked you to wake me when Babe
     Brother comes.

               SUZIE 
     You all act like two roosters.

               GIDEON 
     I'm not going to let him get away
     with murder.

               SUZIE 
     You and Babe Brother are so much
     alike...

               GIDEON 
     He ain't nothing like me. How come
     a man has to have sons that are day
     and night apart? You ought to stop
     protecting him.

               SUZIE 
     Hush.

               GIDEON 
     You're always taking his side.

               SUZIE 
     Hush.

               GIDEON 
     I'm trying to make him a man but
     you keep babying him.

               SUZIE 
     You're going to find yourself on
     the floor.

INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and
paintings by Barns.

Babe Brother wakes up with Sunny standing in the doorway
looking at him. It takes Babe Brother some time to fully wake
up.

Finally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and Sunny
comes over and sits next to him, trying to get his weary
father interested in his remote-control racing car.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I want you to be the richest man in
     the world so I can be the richest
     father in the world.

               SUNNY 
     I don't want to be rich. I want to
     work on the railroad like
     grandfather.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Son, if you are going to have a
     family, you can't always choose a
     job just because you like it. 
          (beat)
     I don't want you to shine anybody's
     shoes or be a porter. You let
     somebody else carry your bags.

Sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room.

INT. BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Babe Brother, having showered but still wearing his pajamas,
drags himself to the kitchen table where his wife LINDA has a
huge coffee mug with the inscription, "I'm the boss", waiting
for him.

Linda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like
her husband. She is wearing a conservatively cut business
dress.

Sunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty
cup. Babe Brother is about to pour him some of his coffee
when Linda objects.

               LINDA 
     NO.

Sunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.

               BABE BROTHER 
     He wouldn't want any if you didn't
     try to keep it away from him.

Linda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down
at her husband.

               LINDA 
     Because you were spoiled, don't try
     to spoil Sunny.

               BABE BROTHER 
     My daddy never gave me anything
     without my having to sweat for it.
     Every summer, the way they kept me
     and Junior out of trouble was to
     send us to Big Daddy's farm. We
     would get up with the chickens.
     Every summer the fence had to be
     repaired. The barn needed a coat of
     paint. We had to pip all of Big
     Mama's hundred laying hens and go
     to church all day on Sunday. For
     Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were
     the mark of a man. Sunny will never
     have to bust his knuckles like we
     did.

               LINDA 
     I want Sunny to have an advantage
     that you and I never had, but he
     needs discipline, and you are not
     helping when I tell him to do
     something and you allow him to get
     out of it.

               BABE BROTHER 
     What is a sip of coffee going to
     do?

               LINDA 
     Coffee is bad for anybody,
     especially for a child.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I don't see you crying about my
     drinking it.

               LINDA 
     How old are you?

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

A SLOW CLOSE UP DOLLY SHOT OF SUZIE'S HANDS DROPPING SEEDS IN
THE GROUND.

Gideon is raking out the chicken coop. He puts the rake down
and walks over to the garden and watches Suzie plant seeds
for a while.

               GIDEON 
     Instead of standing here doing
     nothing, I better give those
     chickens some scratch before they
     start cackling.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

OLD JOHN is pushing his cart up the alley. Old John's face is
washed so clean that it shines. His pants are dirty and his
cart is full of odds and ends of no value. He looks to be
about seventy and fit. Old John throws a sack on Gideon's
fence.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Suzie,is bent over a plant that she is tying to a stick. She
looks up and sees the sack on the fence. A smile appears on
her face. She goes over to the fence.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

Old John is about to take up his journey when Suzie sticks
her head over the fence.

               SUZIE 
     How are you?

               OLD JOHN 
     Tolerably well. I brought you some
     more rabbit manure for your roses.

               SUZIE 
     It is so considerate of you.

Gideon sticks his head over the fence.

               GIDEON 
     Well, well, look who is taking up
     all the sunshine. Brother John, how
     are you doing?

               OLD JOHN 
     I'm still here.

Suzie leaves the two men talking.

               GIDEON 
     Tell me something. How do you get
     energy to stay on the move all day?

               OLD JOHN 
     You couldn't sit on your rump under
     my daddy's roof. No sir. If you
     couldn't outwork his mule, you
     wasn't worth the salt you put in
     greens. You had to wake up looking
     for something to do. I was raised
     as a mule and now I'm a rolling
     stone.

Suzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red
tomatoes to Old John.

               OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
     I didn't mean for you to pay me for
     that.

               SUZIE 
     I know you didn't but you have been
     so thoughtful.

               OLD JOHN 
     But when your sunflowers come up,
     I'll pay you for them.

               SUZIE 
     I planted a row just for you and
     you don't owe me anything.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

HIGH ANGLE SHOTS

off in the distance, a man is cutting his lawn. Gideon and
Suzie are working in their garden. Other couples working
their gardens. Two young men are working on their car, which
is creating a lot of smoke. A group of girls are sitting on a
porch trying to sing while one of the smaller ones is trying
to learn a step.

Skip is on the roof with his radio listening to rap music
while his birds circle over head. From time to time he throws
a rock at them.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

THE CAMERA IS OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM. THE SCENE IS SHOT THROUGH
THE PARTLY OPEN DOOR.

It is hard to see the woman giving birth. There are people
blocking the view of the camera. Suzie is facing the camera
and the woman has her back to the camera.

               MOTHER
     It hurts.

               SUZIE
     Don't push too fast! Breathe! The
     hard part is over. You can see the
     top of the head.

               MOTHER
     It hurts. The pain. 
          (scream)
     It's tearing me.

               SUZIE
     Father, give her a hand.

               FATHER
     Hey, this is too much.

               SUZIE
     You do your part.

               MOTHER
     Can you tell what it is?

               SUZIE
     Almost there.

               FATHER
     It's a junior.

               MOTHER 
     Ah, I wanted a girl.

Suddenly the baby begins to SCREAM.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

A sack appears on Gideon's fence. The sound of Old John's
cart is heard rattling off.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Suzie, Gideon, JUNIOR (Gideon's elder son, 35 years old and
dark skinned), PAT (Junior's wife, who is expecting, about
32) and Rhonda are all seated next to one another in the same
row. The PREACHER is knee-deep in water. He is baptizing a
group of young people. The members of the church are singing
"Take Me To The Water". An Elderly Man who can hardly walk
without help is being led down to the pool.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie, Gideon, Junior, Pat and Rhonda are all seated at the
table eating. Babe Brother is standing up. He looks in the
pot but doesn't find it to his liking. Junior is irritated at
his brother.

               JUNIOR 
     When are you going to find time to
     help me fix the roof?

               BABE BROTHER 
     You all don't believe me when I
     tell you I'm afraid of heights.

               JUNIOR 
     You used that excuse to get out of
     the army.

               BABE BROTHER 
     You always got something to say.

               GIDEON 
     Your mother asked me not to mention
     it but your mother's birthday was
     last week.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some
     cloth but it didn't come in and I
     felt so bad if I would have come to
     her birthday without that, I just
     stayed at home.

               GIDEON 
     What did your wife get her?

               BABE BROTHER 
     We got the same thing.

Junior laughs at Babe Brother's story.

               GIDEON 
     Boy, go tell your wife to come in.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Babe Brother's car, a new Audi, is parked out front.

Linda is in the front seat reading a magazine while Sunny is
asleep in the back seat. Babe Brother sticks his head in the
window.

               BABE BROTHER
     Why don't you come in for a while?

               LINDA 
     I would like to finish reading
     this. What would I talk about? I
     haven't read this month's almanac.
     I don't care to hear about how the
     corn was this fall or how to get
     rid of gophers by putting garlic in
     their holes. They pride themselves
     in making life hard and that's not
     my cup of tea.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie, Gideon, Junior, Pat and Rhonda are still at the table
eating.

               SUZIE 
     You know, Babe Brother's wife just
     dumps greens in the pot without
     washing them.

               GIDEON 
     Babe Brother is a poor boy.

               JUNIOR 
     You all should have been hard on
     him like you were me and he
     wouldn't be the way he is.

               SUZIE 
     Everybody got the same. I breast
     fed him like I breast fed you.

               PAT 
     Junior, you are wrong.

INT. CAR - DAY

               BABE BROTHER 
     Just for a minute.

A dirt rock HITS the front windshield. Linda lets out a
little scream. Babe Brother looks around. Skip is on top of
the roof next door.

               SKIP 
     I didn't mean to hit your car. I
     was throwing at my birds.

INT. FEED STORE - DAY

Gideon is looking at the price of laying mash. He digs his
hand into a barrel of scratch. Sunny also digs his hand in
the barrel.

Suzie is looking at new young plants. She gives the
vegetables a thorough going-over.

Gideon is standing in line waiting to place his order.

               GIDEON 
     I need about five pounds of laying
     mash and you better give me about
     the same of scratch.

While at the counter, Gideon turns and looks around at the
prices of different items. Suzie brings her plants and puts
them on the counter.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     When are you going to have a sale
     on weed killer?

               CASHIER 
     You missed it. We had a two-day
     sale last week.

               GIDEON 
     What kind of a sale is a two-day
     sale? I thought sales last a week
     or two.

               CASHIER 
     Every day we have something
     different. Today's sale is hay. 25%
     off. If you have a horse or cow,
     you're in business.

INT. CAR - DAY

Sunny looks at the Little Girl in the next car; she has her
mouth pressed against the window. She is missing a tooth.
Gideon is behind the wheel while Suzie holds her new plants
up to the sun, carefully looking at them.

Sunny, seated in the back, pokes a hole in the sack of feed.
The mash trickles to the floor as if from an hour glass.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars. Each jar
has a shoot and is half-filled with water. Gideon is on his
knees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet. Sunny is sitting
almost under him listening to him tell stories. Sunny has a
coffee can full of marbles.

               GIDEON 
     All of the preachers were down in
     the basement of the church
     confessing their sins to one
     another. They were way down in the
     basement 'cause they figured no one
     would hear them. One of the
     preachers said, it makes me feel
     too shame to tell how bad I have
     been. You know them young gals that
     sit up in the first row. I can look
     at them and forget my text. I'm
     just lost when it comes to women,
     even them middle age sisters. Then
     another preacher said, I don't
     think I can tell you what my sin is
     'cause it's bad. Another preacher
     said, Brother, we all amongst
     friends. Tell us what's troubling
     your soul. Clear your conscience.

Gideon takes a sip of water.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     So the preacher said, we all got a
     bond 'cause we confessed to one
     another. So let me tell you, my sin
     is corn liquor. I just acts a fool
     behind that spirit water. I loves
     it more than preaching. Now ain't
     that a sin, lord. So all the
     preachers went on confessing, each
     one worst than the last. Finally
     they came to the last preacher who
     had been very quiet and listening
     to every word that fell. One of the
     preachers said to him, it's your
     turn. Confessing will lift you
     burden, Brother. Bare us your soul.
     We did. The last preacher said, no,
     my sin is the worst among all of
     you. One of the preachers said, ah
     go on man and stop all this
     suspense. So the last preacher
     said, like I told you my sin is the
     lowest. 
          (beat)
     My sin is gossiping and I can't
     wait to get out and tell what I
     heard.

Sunny does not get the humor of the story. He is more
interested in picking up his marbles that Gideon's foot
kicked over.

               SUZIE 
     You oughtn't tell him stories like
     that.

               SUNNY 
     Tell me another story.

               GIDEON 
     I'll you a story about the terrapin
     and the rabbit. No, you tell me a
     story. Come on.

               SUNNY 
     Once upon a time, my mommy and
     daddy lived in this big house that
     I bought for them. I got them this
     big car.

A strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the
china teapot, KNOCKING IT TO THE FLOOR. Suzie stops Sunny
from trying to help pick up the pieces.

               SUZIE 
     You stay back. You might cut your
     fingers.

Suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.

               GIDEON 
     I looked everywhere for my toby.

EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

The trees are barren, which gives them an unfriendly look. As
we LOOK at the ground, a man's distorted shadow stops in the
frame.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

A shadow of a man appears on Gideon's porch. The camera tilts
up to HARRY MENTION, a very dark-looking, ageless old man
carrying several boxes held together by a cord. He looks
exhausted from his journey. He looks in his address book and,
satisfied that he reached the right house, he rings the
doorbell.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Suzie comes to the front door; she recognizes Harry right
away. She invites him in. Harry stumps his feet on the porch
several times and then enters.

               SUZIE 
     Harry, I can't believe it is you.
     Gideon, look who is here.

Gideon comes in, wiping his hands. Sunny, carrying the broom,
follows behind.

               GIDEON 
     Harry, good God Almighty, man! It's
     been, what, thirty years or more.
     Suzie, we haven't seen Harry since
     we left home.

Harry is more interested in the boy, but Sunny doesn't want
to come near Harry. It is Gideon's arm that is keeping him
within close range of Harry.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     This is my grandson, Sunny. He is
     my youngest son's child.

               HARRY 
     He kind of favors one of my boys
     when he was about his age.

Sunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches Harry's
shoe with it. Harry hides his anger about being touched with
the broom. Harry takes the broom from Sunny and spits on the
bottom of it.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Boy, that is bad luck to touch a
     fellow with a broom.

               GIDEON 
     He knows better. Sunny, apologize
     to Harry.

               SUNNY 
     I'm sorry.

               GIDEON 
     What are you doing in these parts?

               HARRY
     I came all the way from Detroit by
     bus going to Oakland. The bus
     stopped in Los Angeles. I had to
     get off and take a rest. I'll catch
     the last bus leaving at midnight.
     I'm just too tired to go on.

               GIDEON 
     Why didn't you catch a plane?

               HARRY 
     My feet have never been on anything
     that wasn't directly attached to
     the ground.

               GIDEON 
     Stay until you feel better? I would
     like to hear all the news.

               HARRY 
     I'm worn out but won't you feel
     like you are taking in a stranger?

               SUZIE 
     Stranger my foot, it was my
     grandmother who helped you into
     this world.

               HARRY 
     Well, I don't want to put you out.

               GIDEON 
     Man, put your boxes down and stay
     as long as you like. We have empty
     rooms since the boys got their own
     families and moved out.

               HARRY 
     Well if you're sure, I won't be a
     bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no
     spring mattress. I always make
     myself a pallet on the floor.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

The bedroom door to Harry's room is cracked open. Peering
through the cracked door, we SEE Harry asleep on his pallet.
His back is turned to the camera. It is dead silent. There
does not seem to be any sign of life. On the floor is a plate
that has water in it. It looks like it is for a dog.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie is peeling potatoes and Gideon is ironing.

               SUZIE 
     Poor old Harry, he really must have
     been worn out. He has been asleep
     all day.

Without anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the
doorway for some time.

               HARRY
     Good evening. It must be all the
     different time zones I crossed that
     makes me feel this weary.

               SUZIE 
     You should go back and rest.

               HARRY 
     No, if I rest any longer, I won't
     sleep tonight. May I use your
     bathroom to wash up a bit?

               GIDEON 
     Man, act like this is your home.

               HARRY 
     That's awful generous of you. I
     always ask to keep from wearing out
     welcome.

               SUZIE 
     One can tell you are from back
     home. These people nowadays don't
     know what manners are.

               HARRY 
     Where we come from, you had to know
     how to act right. You had to know
     how to say yes sir and no sir. You
     had to know your place.

               GIDEON 
     You had to tread softly.

The doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it.

               SUZIE 
     Those days you could always find
     something redeeming about even the
     worst person.

               HARRY 
     You remember that boy who lost his
     mind, Joe? You could hear him
     pitching horseshoes at night in the
     dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make
     him mad and call yourself running
     in the house to be safe. He would
     pick up a brick and say "go on in
     there brick and hit somebody" and
     it would find its mark.

               SUZIE 
     I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom
     because of him.

               HARRY 
     All those places that us coloreds
     lived, that we used to call
     Bottoms, have all been changed to
     Drives and Heights. Everything is
     in what you call it, not in what it
     is.

Gideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda.

               GIDEON 
     Harry, I would like for you to meet
     my oldest son, his wife and
     daughter.

               JUNIOR 
     Pleased to meet you. So you're from
     back home, too.

Harry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a
nod of her head and a smile.

Pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but
is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in
her stomach.

               PAT 
     This boy must be turning over. Oh,
     he just kicked me again.

Junior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's
hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a
chair to sit down in.

The SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look
up.

               GIDEON 
     It's the boy next door throwing at
     his birds. I'm just waiting on him
     to hit a pane in the window

               HARRY 
     I'm going to wash up now. You all
     please excuse me.

INT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Harry is wiping off his face with a washcloth. He stares at
himself in the mirror for a long time. The sudden sound of
the boy next door starting to play his trumpet startles him.
He smiles at the trumpeter's efforts.

He wrings the wash cloth out. A reddish oil-like liquid DRIPS
into the face bowl.

EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

A few of the houses have lights on. Suddenly, Gideon's
rooster starts to CROW. A dog starts to bark and a garbage
can is knocked over. Bedroom lights in almost all the houses
in the neighborhood pop on. The voices of neighbors
complaining are heard.

INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Harry is just waking up. He listens to the voices of Suzie
and Gideon as they get ready for church.

INT. FRONT ROOM - MORNING

Gideon is paging through the Bible as he stands by the door,
waiting for Suzie who is watering her plants. Harry comes in.

               HARRY 
     Good morning.

               GIDEON 
     You ought to come hear our
     preacher. Remember old Cat Iron?
     Well, our preacher is just as
     strong.

               HARRY 
     Next time when I feel a little
     better perhaps.

               GIDEON 
     I was going to get up and get a hen
     out there for dinner, but time got
     away.

               HARRY 
     Oh, I would feel much at home if
     you let me get one for you. I
     haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a
     month of Sundays. You know, folks
     would call my daddy to kill their
     hogs. That used to be my trade from
     time to time.

               GIDEON 
     Well, I would appreciate that.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Gideon and Suzie are stepping off the porch. Harry is
standing behind the screen door.

Gideon and Suzie get in Junior's car. Junior, Pat and Rhonda
wave to Harry as the car pulls away.

INT. LIVING HOUSE - DAY

IT IS A TRACKING SHOT, FOLLOWING HARRY THROUGH THE HOUSE.

Harry looks through Gideon's and Suzie's private things. He
looks at the baby pictures that fill the mirror. He reads
Suzie's letters that are dated years ago. In one of the
letters, he finds a picture of a man standing behind a
plough. "Uncle Joe after Ella's death" is written on the
back. A picture of a mule holds his interest. He looks at it
for a long time and carries it with him as he continues his
search.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Harry slowly walks along the rows in Suzie's garden. He
stands by the chicken cage. Suddenly, the chickens start to
run about and CACKLE as if a dog had gotten in.

Harry turns from the chicken coop. He stands still. Sunny is
hiding behind a bush.

Sunny steps around the bush. Harry looks at Sunny with such
concentration that Sunny takes a step backward as if getting
ready to defend himself.

MRS. BAKER, a black woman in her early thirties, comes out on
the back porch. She shakes out a rug. She stops shaking the
rug and stares at Harry.

Harry becomes aware of Mrs. Baker's stare. He comes to
himself and smiles at her.

INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY

Harry and Babe Brother are playing cards while Linda watches
and Sunny plays by himself on the floor. In the sink is a
newspaper full of bloody feathers. A small flame is under a
pot on the stove. Harry looks at the chicken in the pot and
sits back down.

               LINDA 
     You don't act like the rest of
     Gideon's friends. They believe if
     you are not hard at work, you are
     hard at sin.

               HARRY 
     Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I
     don't believe in sin, though there
     is good and evil. 
          (beat)
     And evil is a thing you work at.

Harry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. It has a
rabbit foot attached to it. Harry cleans his fingernail with
the knife. Sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. He reaches
for the knife.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Not you mustn't touch. Your mama
     might not like you handling knives.

               LINDA 
     I think he wants to see your rabbit
     foot.

               HARRY 
     I let this rabbit foot do in place
     of my toby that I lost years ago.

               LINDA 
     What's a toby?

               HARRY 
     You don't want to be at crossroads
     without one. It's a charm that old
     people teach you how to make. I had
     one for a long time that belonged
     to my grandmother who had it ever
     since she was a child. 
          (beat)
     In my travels I misplaced it. I
     have been looking over my shoulder
     ever since.

               LINDA 
     I thought you weren't old
     fashioned.

               HARRY 
     In some things. When we were
     children, there used to be an old
     man that came around and would
     snatch your soul if you didn't have
     something on you that didn't make a
     X.

Harry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife.
After cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to
Babe Brother.

Harry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself.

               HARRY 
     Did you have your child at home?

               LINDA 
     No. No. No. No. I had my Child at
     Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no
     county hospital. You have to have
     cash or check before you come in
     the door.

               HARRY 
     Some folks take that natural stuff
     too far.

               LINDA 
     Junior's wife kept her afterbirth'
     in the refrigerator. That's why I
     do not eat over there now.

               HARRY 
     Country people got so many strange
     ways,

Harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Did you ever have to use this
     thing?

               HARRY 
     That is called a crab apple switch.
     It's for those bad acting monkeys
     and just the thing for a mean dog.
     Now I don't know if I actually did
     what I did or got my life and story
     mixed in with other folk's stories
     but I seem to recall that I had to
     use my crab apple on a boy from
     back home. I was up in Memphis
     working on the railroad, like your
     daddy who had an easy job. He would
     sing a song that had a cadence and
     we would lay track. Anyway I was
     coming down Beale Street and I
     heard this music coming from a
     saloon. Sure enough it was Emory.
     My daddy taught both of us to play
     but Emory was natural at it. Got in
     a blues band and what not. He and
     another boy had killed a boy named
     Hocker sometime back and they
     balled the Jack leaving town. Emory
     had lost one eye and had a scar
     running down his face. Bad luck I
     would say. He got to drinking that
     corn liquor. We went to his girl's
     room and he wouldn't stop drinking.
     He started talking about the old
     days and he went mad. He pulled his
     knife and I got to mine first. The
     lights went out.

Linda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman
on the back.

               BABE BROTHER
     Don't pick up the cards if you are
     not in the game. Did he die?

               HARRY 
     I don't know what happened to him.
     He just ran out into the streets. 
          (beat)
     I got some old records I want you
     to hear. I like the blues sung
     simply, man and a guitar. Or sung
     by a woman who had bad luck all her
     life. Don't ever let anyone tell
     you his life's story if it is of a
     weary life full of sadness. When I
     was a boy, a man told me a story of
     how he lost all of his sons and
     I'll be damned if the same thing
     didn't happen to me.

Sunny is busy playing in the curtains.

The SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to
get the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as
Suzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed.

               LINDA 
     How was church?

Gideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know
what to say.

EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY

Rodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud
as he can. The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Gideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. Harry is
leaning against the door.

               HARRY 
     How often is your wife called to
     help delivery?

               GIDEON 
     It was slow. Now it seems like
     everyone is having births at home.

Gideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot
believe it.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     What could have caused this? I just
     changed this damn thing.

               HARRY 
     Everything these days is made
     overseas.

               GIDEON 
     You and Babe Brother hit it off so
     well.

               HARRY 
     Course, it is your business, but I
     feel obliged to tell you that maybe
     you have not been fair with the
     boy.

               GIDEON 
     I tried to teach him right from
     wrong just like I did his Junior.

               HARRY 
     Everyone has to follow his own
     plough. A man doesn't have to know
     how to cut a wick and clean a
     chimney nowadays. City people don't
     give a hoot and a holler about the
     shape of the moon nowadays. You
     don't plant old ways...
          (beat)
     ... but, at the end, you find
     yourself doing what your father did
     but you have to have the land in
     you.
          (beat)
     It's when you want to give the
     house or farm to the kids and they
     don't want it. You sell it to a
     stranger. You worked your whole
     life, for what?
          (beat)
     I doubt if people nowadays have
     knowledge of a victory garden or
     seen an inch worm. All what we've
     experienced has no meaning.

               GIDEON 
     You're suppose to teach your
     children what you know. Junior, I
     don't have to worry about. Babe
     Brother is a different story.

               HARRY 
     You still call him boy. You call
     Babe Brother boy in front of his
     wife and son.

               GIDEON 
     My daddy called me boy up to the
     time he died. I was always boy to
     him.

               HARRY 
     'Course, you could be right. Your
     sons are alive. All my sons are
     dead.

Off-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN.

INT. BABE BROTHER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Babe Brother is sitting with Sunny by the screen door blowing
giant bubbles. The bubbles drift past Linda, who is sitting
at the table with real estate papers all over the table. She
is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to
stop disturbing her.

Babe Brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to
shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first
time buyer.

               LINDA 
     It has three bedrooms, one and a
     half baths. Well, yes, that means
     two toilets and one bath. Well...
     Yes, by appointment... Call me back
     if you decide.

She hangs up the phone.

               LINDA 
     You would think people never lived
     in a house if they have to ask what
     does 1 1/2 baths mean.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Will you still get the money from
     your father?

               LINDA 
     I told him we might not need it, if
     you can talk your parents into
     giving you your share of the
     property.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Pops put Big Daddy's farm in
     Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed
     it so no one can borrow on it.

               LINDA 
     We could borrow on that land and
     put the money to work.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I preached to Mom and Dad about it
     but they are stuck in their ways,
     it's like talking to a brick. But
     if there is a way...

Babe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his
hands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone.

INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Junior is on the phone with Babe Brother. Pat crosses in
front of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner.
Babe Brother's voice is just audible.

               JUNIOR 
     You want me to mortgage my house to
     invest in a scheme of yours? You
     know the last time we went into
     something together Daddy had to go
     in his savings to keep us from
     ending on the street.

               BABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
     Why are you always afraid to get
     somewhere?

               JUNIOR 
     This is not a good time to take
     chances. Your best friend, Robert,
     an accountant, lost his home and is
     out on the street. We see him from
     time to time. He comes down to
     church for a free meal.

               BABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
     This is what it is all about,
     trying to keep from being out on
     the street.

               JUNIOR 
     Robert asks about you. When are you
     going to do something to help him?

               BABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
     Maybe I can get down there next
     week.

Junior turns to his wife, who is off-camera.

               JUNIOR 
     Babe Brother always acts like a
     gambler who is in the biggest game
     of his life and don't know about
     playing cards.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON

Harry and Gideon are walking along a railroad track. The sun
is blinding. The heat makes the asphalt Appear to turn into a
lake off in the distance. Gideon appears exhausted; beads of
sweat continually form on his forehead. He fans himself with
his hat. Harry is unaffected by the hot temperature.

               HARRY 
     I can sit here and look at train
     tracks all day. We laid enough of
     them, didn't we? So many memories
     are stretched along tracks like
     these.

Gideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the
distance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON (EFFECT)

The tracks begin to twist and bend. Off in the distance,
faint images of men laying track to a song.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON

Gideon is standing with his hat in his hand. His posture is
that of an extremely old man.

               GIDEON 
     In weather like this, you cannot
     walk around bare-headed.

He wipes the sweat from his hat band.

               HARRY 
     We'll go a little farther. The walk
     will do us some good.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Suzie is peeling apples while Sunny, standing next to her,
catches peelings in his mouth. Pat is sitting next to the
window. She is uncomfortable. She loosens her pants, giving
her stomach more room. Rhonda is leaning over the back of the
chair with her arms around Pat's neck. They are in
silhouette.

               PAT 
     Did you do your homework?

               RHONDA 
     Yes.
          (beat)
     Mama?

               PAT 
     What?

               RHONDA 
     Can I name the baby?

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie knocks on the door. Harry comes to the door still
buttoning his shirt.

               SUZIE 
     I have someone I want you to meet.

               HARRY 
     I'll be right there.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Gideon in the background in the kitchen washing off the
vegetables. Suzie and HATTIE are sitting at the table. Harry
comes in and is surprised to see Hat tie. Hattie is in her
late sixties but looks well. She makes a conscious effort to
dress plainly.

               HATTIE 
     I couldn't believe it when Suzie
     called and said you were staying
     here. How have you been?

               HARRY 
     Girl, do you still sing and dance?

               HATTIE 
     No, I'm a different person now,
     Harry.

Hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from
time to time. Gideon comes in from the kitchen.

               GIDEON 
     Haven't the years been good to
     Hattie?

               HARRY 
     It hasn't been the years; it's been
     the men in her life.

               HATTIE 
     Harry, that's not nice. I'm in
     church now.

               HARRY 
     Why run out and close the barn door
     when the horse is gone? I remember
     when you weren't saved. That was
     way back yonder when the Natchez
     Trace was just a dirt road.

               HATTIE 
     Some people grow up and change
     their ways.

               HARRY 
     I know your mother ain't still
     operating that house of hers.

               HATTIE 
     My mother passed on years ago.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

M.C. slams the door to his car and hurries up the steps,
leaving HERMAN, in spite of his bad condition, to get out of
the car the best he can. The car door almost knocks poor
Herman over. M.C. seems rather youthful because of his energy
and awkwardness. He is a large muscular man.

Herman is a dried-up man with nothing, not even a shadow. He
has a racking COUGH.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

M.C. gives Gideon a bear hug, lifting him off his feet. On
seeing Suzie, he drops Gideon and rushes over to lift her up
off her feet.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Herman is still trying to get out of the car.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

M.C. lifts Suzie off the ground twice. He runs over to Hattie
who does not want to be handled, tries to withdraw but M.C.
forces her to her feet and gives a big bear hug. Hattie has a
series of squinting attacks. M.C. squints in return.

               HATTIE 
     M.C., you still ain't house broken.

               GIDEON 
     Good God Almighty, if it ain't like
     a parade of people from out of the
     past. M.C., where did you come
     from?

               M.C.
     I live here.

There is a TAPPING on the door.

               M.C. (CONT'D)
     That's old Herman.

               HATTIE
     Harry, what did you do, rob the
     graveyard?

Herman hobbles in and, after a minute of COUGHING, a smile
forms on his face.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Suzie, Gideon and Hattie are seated at the table while M.C.
bounces from one end of the table to the other. One moment he
is on his knees and next moment he is leaning over someone to
flick his ashes in the ashtray on the table. Hattie hates it
when he comes near her.

Harry and Herman sit together in the corner chewing on
starch.

               M.C. 
     Hattie, do you still dance?

               HATTIE
     I'm in church.

               M.C.
     What does that got to do with it?

               HATTIE
     Suzie, you still have Joe's number?

               SUZIE
     I will have to look for it.

               M.C.
     Who's Joe?

               HATTIE
     None of your business.

               HARRY
     That is a boy from home, Lulla's
     brother.

Suzie is surprised.

               SUZIE 
     Harry, you know everything.

               HARRY 
     You got to know everything, do
     everything, and be everything.

Gideon brings a fresh pot of coffee. Gideon tries to signal
M.C. to stop harassing Hattie. M.C. leans over Hattie again
to use the ashtray.

Harry is helping Herman to his feet. Herman starts to cough.
They come over and join the rest of the crowd at the table.
Harry seats Herman next to Gideon and pours Herman a cup of
coffee. He puts the sugar and cream in the coffee for Herman.
Suzie comes back with Joe's number and hands it to Hattie.

               HERMAN 
     M.C., I'm worn out. You ready to
     go?

               M.C. 
     If you are tired, go sit in the
     car.

               HERMAN 
     Suzie, do you have any Swamp Root?

               SUZIE 
     No, but I might have some Indian
     Chief Tonic.

               HATTIE 
     I haven't heard anyone mention
     Swamp Root since button-up shoes
     went out.

               HARRY 
     You can certainly tell how old you
     are, my dear.

Hattie is angered.

               HATTIE 
     You know the saying, "your heart is
     in your left hand."

               HARRY 
     Now I was trying to be nice, to
     make conversation, since we go back
     some.

               HATTIE
     I was quoting from the Bible. If
     the shoe fits, wear it.

               HARRY 
     "Out of weariness, I spoke to my
     own heart; to leave it all and to
     die. And I gave my heart to know
     madness and folly."

               M.C. 
     You ain't going to win playing the
     dozens with Harry.

               HERMAN 
     You all ought to get along.

               HATTIE 
     Harry, you know you remind me of so
     much that went wrong in my life.
     When I heard you were here, I made
     a special effort to come and see
     you. I see you are still a pile of
     wet chicken feathers.

               HERMAN 
     Oh Lord.

               HARRY 
     My sister, women can get away with
     so much. I don't have any enemies
     'cause I don't live in the past. As
     Pushkin, you don't know him, said,
     "In the hope of glory and good, I
     look without fear ahead."

               M.C. 
     Harry has got your number.

               HATTIE 
     An empty wagon makes a lot of noise
     and you, tappy head, you ain't
     worth the salt you put in greens.

               HARRY 
     Speaking of tappy heads, we ought
     to have an old fashion fish fry.

               HERMAN 
     I don't have too many fish fries
     left.

               HARRY 
     We can have it here next week.

               HATTIE 
     Is this your house?

               HARRY 
     Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you
     say?

               GIDEON 
     Well, it's up to Suzie.

               SUZIE 
     It would be nice.

               HATTIE 
     In the meantime Harry can slaughter
     us a hog.

               HARRY 
     I already have, my dear.

               HERMAN 
     Please, M.C., take me home.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The children of the women in Suzie's natural birth group are
huddled together SINGING "Ashiine Ca Chew". The voices of the
women in the next room are audible. The kids go outside to
sit on the porch.

INT. HOUSE, WORK ROOM - DAY

Most of the women have their newborns with them and are
engaging in talk about how their other children had to adjust
and etc.

A young white mother, REBECCA WILSON, with both her children,
a four year old and one just a few months old, talks with a
deep southern accent.

               WILSON 
     No one in my family ever been to a
     hospital to give birth. My sister
     has four children and all were born
     at home. My mother and her mother,
     it just goes on and on.

EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY

A mother leaves with her baby wrapped in a blanket. The kids
surround her, wanting to see the baby.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY

Pat is looking at a book of baby names. Harry passes the door
and stops.

               HARRY 
     A woman in family way just reminds
     of spring and my younger days.

               PAT 
     That's nice.

               HARRY 
     Well, you and your husband are
     special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do
     volunteer work to help feed the
     poor.

Pat beams with joy because Harry recognizes the important
work she is doing.

               HARRY
     How many people do you all feed?

               PAT 
     Last Saturday we handed out over
     two hundred meals.

               HARRY 
     Good God Almighty, bless your
     bones.
          (pause)
     But the problem grows.

               PAT 
     Week by week the crowds at the door
     keeps getting larger. We can't feed
     all the hungry.

               HARRY 
     Of course not. Have you ever heard
     of a man jumping in the river to
     save five hundred drowning people?
     No you ain't.
          (pause)
     You have to take just one and
     fatten him up. When you spread help
     too thin, you , you just nickel and
     dime the situation. If you try to
     save all, all die but if you save
     one life, life goes on. You just
     have to remember, medicine that
     works leaves a bitter taste.

Harry looks at the baby picture pasted over the mirror. He
takes the picture of his children from his old black dusty
wallet and compares the faces of his kids with those on the
mirror. He talks to himself more than to Pat.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     You just take one; you thaw out the
     cold and hunger in his bones from
     sleeping on the bare ground.

Pat watches him and loses herself in what he is doing. She
responds automatically

               PAT
     I don't know if we could take one
     in with Rhonda and me at home alone
     at times.

               HARRY
     Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at
     you. Hey, you have to think of
     yourself. A lot of them have all
     kinds of diseases and will cut your
     throat while you sleep. There are
     too many bad people out there.

EXT. GIDEON'S BACK PORCH - DAY

Junior is taking the back door off to paint. Harry helps him
carry the door and lay it on a saw horse.

               JUNIOR
     I appreciate you lending me a hand.
     That lazy ass brother of mine was
     suppose to help me.

               HARRY
     Well some folks are still waiting
     for their comeuppance. Don't take
     me wrong but you can't judge people
     by how you act. You're a caring
     person.

               JUNIOR 
     He should be caring. That is not
     too much to ask.

               HARRY 
     Ya, but you can't do the shuffle
     with one leg. You and your wife, in
     your spare time, work with the less
     fortunate. Now I'm not talking
     about you and what you do but some
     folks that always run to help the
     victim, deep down are attracted to
     pain and suffering and love to be
     near the dying.

               JUNIOR 
     All the people working with us are
     really doing it 'cause they hate to
     see suffering.

               HARRY 
     You never know what's in the heart
     and just because you can cry
     doesn't make you human.

INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rhonda is in the background washing dishes. Pat and Junior
are sitting at the dining room table, arguing.

               JUNIOR 
     We can't really bring another
     family in here with us.

               PAT
     Why not? Harry says that's the only
     way to do good.

               JUNIOR 
     When did you talk to Harry?

               PAT 
     Don't shout!

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Gideon and Sunny are in the garden digging for worms. The
chickens

               GIDEON 
     I think we have enough. So now tell
     me a story.

EXT. BALDWIN HILLS LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON

Gideon is sitting on a rock by the lake. His image is
reflected in the lake. He is asleep. Sunny is putting new
bait on one of the reels and with a whip of the pole, he
casts to the center of the lake. He leans against a tree.
Sunny looks at his sleeping grandfather. Gideon has his pant
legs rolled up. His socks have lost their elastic. His head
is resting on his chest.

Sunny goes near the water.

               GIDEON 
     Be careful of the water.

Sunny looks back at his grandfather, who appears to be
asleep.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

There is one fish in the bucket.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

WIDE ANGLE SHOT FROM HIGH ANGLE

Gideon and Sunny are sitting next to each other. The lake
reflects the sky: a deep red. The eerie sound of a long train
whistle breaks the silence.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Harry, Babe Brother and Linda come in after staying out all
night. Linda looks as though she is about to fall asleep
standing up. She awakes and looks at Harry. There is dislike
in her stare. Suzie and Gideon notice Linda fading away.

               SUZIE 
     Are you feeling well?

               LINDA 
     I've never been so tired in my
     life. Where is Sunny?

               SUZIE 
     He is getting his things together.
     Babe Brother, you ought to take
     your wife home so she can get some
     rest.

               BABE BROTHER 
     In a minute.

Sunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He
stands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way,
ushers Babe Brother out of the door.

               HARRY 
     Take your wife and child home, boy.

Babe Brother seems all too happy to obey Harry. After Harry
closes the door behind Babe Brother, he turns with a wide
smile.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     I got a surprise for you tonight.

Harry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     This old buffalo has been in the
     sun too long.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Suzie and Gideon are getting the food ready while Harry,
wearing a shirt that looks like it is made of shiny
snakeskin, sits in a darkened corner of the room, cutting his
fingernails with his knife.

The door bell rings and Harry slowly walks over to answer the
door. Suzie puts the punch bowl down and hurries over to meet
the first guests, FRED JENKINS, an elderly black man whom she
hasn't seen in years, and Esme Jenkins, his wife.

               SUZIE 
     Fred Jenkins.

               JENKINS 
     Suzie, you haven't changed and you,
     Gideon, if you don't look like John
     Henry. Oh, this is my wife, Esme.
     My first wife Lulie died.

More people arrive, bottle-necking the doorway. Gideon helps
the Jenkinses to a chair. Hattie comes with her brother
MARSH, who is not too pleased to see Harry. OKRA TATE, an
elderly black man with dark circles under his eyes, comes in
limping badly with an old Polaroid camera hanging from his
neck.

Babe Brother, Linda, Junior, Pat and Rhonda, who is holding
Sunny's hand, all come in together. M.C. drags Herman through
the door coughing. FLIM ANDERSON and his son DOUG are
followed by the twins, WILLIAM and LOVIRAY NORWOOD, who are
in their late 70's.

Babe Brother leaves Linda standing by herself to be next to
Harry.

Zenia Dent, an elderly white woman with a strong Southern
accent, arrives with her husband, Howard Dent, a black man,
who is in a wheelchair. The Twins and Howard are the center
of attention.

Okra comes over and whispers into Harry's ear. Okra leaves
through the front door. Okra comes back in with a bag. Harry,
Babe Brother, M.C. and Herman follow Okra to the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Okra sets the bag on the table and steps back to allow Harry
to unveil the bottle of corn liquor.

               BABE BROTHER
     What is that?

               HARRY
     Boy, that is the real South. That
     is real corn liquor.

A crowd starts to gather around.

               FLIM
     What is in the bottle?

               M.C.
     It ain't Geritol.

M.C. starts to hand out tea cups while Harry pours everyone a
drink.

               HERMAN
     There is a fight in every bottle.

               GIDEON
     You tappy heads better not tear
     down my house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

An attractive Woman, in her younger days a knockout, puts on
a record and starts to pop her fingers to the music as she
moves towards the center of the floor dancing by herself,
inviting anyone bold enough to join her.

A group of Men who haven't seen each other in years are
asking questions about news of old friends.

Okra is trying to get his camera working.

Herman is following M.C. through the crowd with his hand
resting on M.C.'s shoulder as if he were a blind person. His
racking COUGH is frightening.

An older couple dancing attract the attention of the crowd.
The man is wearing Stacy Adams shoes polished to see one's
face in them. He gives expression to his moves as if he and
the woman are talking with their bodies.

Junior and Pat try to bring in something more modern to outdo
the older couple.

Herman corners Hattie, trying to get her to sing.

               HATTIE 
     Look, you better get out of my face
     before I slap the living daylights
     out of you.

Harry stops the music.

               HARRY 
     You folks excuse me but you know we
     have a celebrity from out of the
     past, our own nightingale. If you
     had any good times in your life,
     you remember Hattie. She use to
     keep those juke joints steaming. If
     Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were the
     stars, she was the sun. Let's get
     Hattie to sing something from the
     old days.

Hattie has started her nervous twitch again. She is so mad
that she bites her lip to keep from exploding.

               HATTIE 
     Harry always tries to be the king
     fish. I told him I'm a new person.
     I'm saved.

Harry signals an old man, PERCY, to start playing his guitar.
Percy starts to play but Hattie doesn't join him. He looks to
Harry for a sign of what to do. Hattie walks away.

Percy starts to SING by himself but someone puts a record on,
interrupting his singing. People are back to dancing.

A YOUNGER WOMAN is dancing with an OLDER MAN with such vigor,
forcing the old man to try to keep up, that people grow
concerned. People near him try to make him slow down but his
pride forces him to be ridiculous.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Linda sits with Sunny and Rhonda watching TV.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

The noise has gotten louder, everyone talking at the top of
his voice.

Gideon is busy going around to everyone seeing if everything
is okay. Gideon and Suzie have worked up a sweat trying to
attend to everyone's needs.

Linda rejoins the party. She moves through the crowd and sees
Babe Brother standing next to Harry. She is disappointed and
stays at a distance.

Harry is with a group of people. Marsh tries to get Harry's
attention.

               MARSH 
     Harry, you will not remember me but
     we go back quite a ways. I'm glad
     Hattie told me that you will be
     here 'cause there is a matter that
     has been troubling me all these
     years that maybe you can help me
     clear it up.

Harry stares into Marsh's eyes, then looks him over from head
to toe.

               HARRY 
     Man, I can't talk to you now. I'm
     filling in the gaps with these
     folks.

Harry turns his back on Marsh. Marsh stands there looking at
Harry's profile. He turns and walks away.

The record ends. The Younger Woman and the Older Man wait for
the next record.

               YOUNGER WOMAN 
     How do you manage to keep in step
     and move around so like one of them
     young boys?

               OLDER MAN 
     Get yourself a pace-maker like me.

Linda is standing by herself. She watches Babe Brother and
Harry walk towards the kitchen. Pat comes to talk to her.

               PAT 
     These old folks can dance better
     than I can. Get rid of that long
     face. Get one of these old farts to
     show you how to do the Black
     Bottom.

Okra, holding his camera, all of the attachments in one hand
and a glass in his other hand, tries to offer Hattie a drink.

               OKRA 
     Don't be so stand-offish.

Hattie pushes him away. The drink spills on him. She turns
and walks away. He follows her.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Marsh sits in a chair opposite Harry. Babe Brother stands
behind Harry. Harry, knowing that Marsh is going to bring up
unpleasant things of the past, feels the need to get rid of
Babe Brother.

               HARRY 
     Son, you haven't danced with your
     wife all night.

Babe Brother is reluctant to leave, but Harry gives him a
nudge. He goes looking for Linda.

               MARSH 
     There is something that I always
     wanted to know. Tell me, how did
     those boys die?

               HARRY 
     Now who are we talking about?

               MARSH 
     Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start
     with. The Johnson's Hocker was
     another one...

               HARRY 
     Wasn't Hocker lynched?

               MARSH 
     You know as well as I do that it
     was made to look like he was
     lynched. Now who would hang someone
     from a persimmon tree?

               HARRY 
     What difference does it make if
     it's persimmon, oak tree or
     huckleberry bush?

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Gideon, Babe Brother, and Linda go outside.

EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT

The sounds of the party drift out from the house as Gideon,
Linda and Babe Brother talk.

               GIDEON 
     Tell me, how come me and Suzie have
     to be mother and father to your
     child? You never take the boy to
     the park, circus or anything. If we
     did not take him to church, he
     wouldn't have any sense of
     religion.

               LINDA 
     I think forcing him to go to church
     when he really doesn't understand
     is not saving his soul. When he
     gets old enough to make up his own
     mind about religion, that will be
     better. It will be his intellectual
     decision.

               GIDEON 
     Is that the way your parents raised
     you?

               BABE BROTHER 
     Why, you don't want us to bring him
     over?

               GIDEON 
     No, it's that when do you have time
     to be parents to him? You guys
     don't pick him up until nine, ten
     at night. You are into yourselves,
     as the saying goes. Spend some time
     trying to be parents. Take him to
     the mountains, fishing. You ought
     to let him get to know nature.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Well, you are his grandfather. He
     is supposed to spend some time with
     you. You're supposed to show him
     those woodsy things and this and
     that.

               GIDEON 
     Junior spends time with his child.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Oh here we go with that.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Okra is trying to get enough light for his old Polaroid
camera. M.C. takes a shade off a lamp and holds it next to
the Twins, nearly blinding them.

               WILLIAM 
     Hurry up and take this picture.

               FRED 
     If it wasn't for the NRA, colored
     people would have been the lost
     tribe.

               FLIM 
     Remember what they use to call the
     NRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army.

M.C. is still holding the naked lamp while Okra tries to take
pictures.

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

               MARSH 
     Hocker's death almost caused a race
     riot. A lot of innocent people
     could have been hurt behind that.

               HARRY 
     Strange as it may seem, it might
     have cleared the waters. Sometimes
     the right action comes from the
     wrong reason.

EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Gideon, Babe Brother and Linda are just standing, facing one
another. Suzie comes out on the porch.

               SUZIE 
     Do you want your coat? It's cold
     out here.

               GIDEON 
     No, I'm too hot now.

               SUZIE 
     You better be careful. You'll get a
     stroke arguing.

               GIDEON 
     I wouldn't care if I drop dead if
     he learn something from it. 
          (beat)
     Son, you make me wish I was dead.

               SUZIE 
     Gideon, don't say things like that.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Why does he always pick on me?

               LINDA 
     He is just being like all parents,
     concerned about the ones they love.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I don't need that kind of love. And
     I don't want to be reminded all the
     time that Big Mama's grandmother
     was born in slavery. If you really
     care about me, just tell me how I
     can make money.

               SUZIE 
     Babe Brother, I'm going to take my
     hand and hit you across your mouth.

               LINDA 
     He doesn't mean what he says.

               GIDEON 
     Let us go back in before the night
     of celebration becomes a night of
     me killing my son.

               SUZIE 
     No. Before anyone moves, you two
     shake hands and don't carry it any
     further.

Linda gives Babe Brother a jab with her elbow. His hand
reaches out to Gideon.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

M.C. and Herman put the unshaded lamps next to Hattie so okra
can get a better picture. Percy starts to play his guitar.
Herman stands behind Percy.

               HATTIE 
     Don't make me say something nasty
     now.

Percy starts to play an old religious number and Hattie
STARTS TO SING. Everything stops for a moment as her VOICE
fills the room.

Then most of the guests pick up and join in. M.C. moves the
lamp next to Percy so Okra can take his picture.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Marsh and Harry are getting quite loud in their argument. It
has become a kind of controlled anger.

               HARRY 
     I think if anybody had a hand in
     killing Hocker, you ought to ask or
     you should have asked Emory and
     Chick.

               MARSH 
     Chick was outright killed by a mob.
     He killed a white man that owed him
     some money and when they caught up
     with him, they tied him behind a
     car and dragged him from out of the
     hills back to town.

               HARRY 
     Those boys never did have good
     luck.

               MARSH 
     You damn right they didn't,
     especially Emory, my cousin.

               HARRY 
     Emory had made a lot of enemies. He
     had a big mouth.

M.C. and Okra come in wanting to take pictures. Marsh is
pretty mad about them intruding. M.C. sets the naked lamp in
front of Marsh, on the floor, almost between his legs.

Before Okra can get his camera set to shoot, Marsh leaves.
Harry smiles as if he had won a major victory. Herman flops
down in the empty chair and starts to COUGH.

Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up
one of the twins, Loviray. They carry the twin towards
Herman's seat. Herman is slow to react. Herman gets up very
slow. Finally, they are able to seat the twin.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     What's the problem here?

               SUZIE 
     She has a fish bone caught in her
     throat. Could all of you go in the
     other room? Gideon, get some bread
     and toast it quickly and find me
     the cod liver oil.

The twin is holding her throat and PANTING like a fish out of
water. She is in a lot of pain. William, the twin brother, is
standing at the door with a tragic face.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Gideon is trying to get out of bed. He sits on the side of
the bed and starts to COUGH.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Harry has his back to the camera, sitting in a chair facing a
wall. He is naked from the waist up. An empty plate is placed
not too far from where he is sitting. He is cutting an apple.
He licks the blade of his knife.

INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Babe Brother is asleep. Linda is dressed to go to work. She
throws his suit on the foot of the bed.

               LINDA 
     Are you going to work or sleep all
     day?

He snores louder. She opens the window and pulls back the
cover. The cold air makes him draw up. On walking out, Linda
says in a rather hurt voice:

               LINDA 
     Remember, you promised to take
     Sunny to Magic Mountain today.

Babe Brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart
is bothering him.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Gideon tries to put his pants on. He is too weak and sits
back on the bed with his pants only up as far as his knees.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Suzie gets up to turn off the coffee kettle. When the kettle
WHISTLE dies away, the sound of Gideon's VOICE is heard
calling Suzie for help. The sound of his voice frightens her.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie bursts into the room and then moves very slowly to
Gideon, who is sitting on the bed out of breath.

               GIDEON 
     I'm worn out.

               SUZIE 
     Just stay in bed and rest.

               GIDEON 
     I have to feed the chickens before
     they wake everybody up.

               SUZIE 
     You stay inside. I will see to
     them.

               GIDEON 
     I will appreciate that.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

Suzie and Junior are sitting at the dining room table. Harry,
looking like he has just gotten out of bed, drags himself in.

               HARRY 
     How is everybody?

               SUZIE 
     Tolerable well.

               JUNIOR 
     How did you sleep last night?

There is obvious hostility in Junior's tone. Harry senses
Junior's hostility and chooses to ignore it.

               HARRY 
     Ah, you young folks don't know how
     it is. How is Gideon today?

               SUZIE 
     He wasn't able to get out of bed
     today.

               HARRY 
     I hope that it's nothing serious.

               SUZIE 
     He has never gotten rid of the
     malaria. He is usually up and at it
     the next day. I'm going to make him
     fresh chicken broth.

               HARRY 
     Let me earn my keep. I'll go out
     and get a hen and have it picked
     and ready for the pot. Try to make
     him some cow tea next time.

Junior stares at Harry. Harry returns Junior's stare and
Junior finds himself embarrassed. Junior looks down at his
pants leg and attempts to fix the crease in his pants by
making a wedge with his fingers and running his fingers along
the old crease.

As Harry walks towards the back door, he looks back at
Junior.

EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING

The pigeons take to the air like an explosion. The chickens
start to CACKLE and run about as Harry reaches for one with
his cane. The SOUND of the boy next door practicing with his
trumpet adds to the bedlam.

Suzie is standing on the steps, shouting to Harry. The noise
of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next
door drown out Suzie's voice. Not getting Harry's attention,
she hurries down the steps.

Harry has caught a hen that is SCREAMING her head off. He
looks around and finds Suzie hurrying towards him.

               SUZIE 
     Can you watch Gideon for a while?
     One of the girls is going into
     labor. Junior is going to drive me
     over.

               HARRY 
     You just run along. I'll fix him
     his soup. He will be all right.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

Suzie and another woman who will be helping her are asleep.
Suzie is in the chair and the woman is asleep on the floor.
The woman who is in labor is reading a magazine and seems
somewhat bored.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Harry opens the door and slowly walks in. Gideon is asleep.
Harry picks up Gideon's pants from the back of the chair.
Gideon's false teeth fall to the floor.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

There is a flurry of activity; the woman is contracting.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

The untouched chicken broth sits on the night stand. Gideon
is TALKING in his sleep. Morning light filters through the
window shade. The room takes on a brownish tint. Gideon has
dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged
considerably.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Harry is reading the Bible. He runs his finger over the print
of the Bible. After reading the passage, he stares at the
empty plate on the floor for what seems like a long time. He
claps the Bible shut, causing a loud NOISE to ECHO through
the house.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - MORNING

Suzie is walking slowly up the steps.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Suzie raises the window shade and is shocked to see the state
that Gideon is in.

               SUZIE 
     Oh my Lord!

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with people. Suzie is putting Gideon's
shirt on. Harry is leaning against the door. After having put
his shirt on, Suzie puts his house shoes on and directs Babe
Brother and Junior to hold him up while she tucks his shirt
in and puts on his suspenders.

It takes almost everyone to hoist Gideon. Linda and Pat push
the bed and night-stand out of the way as Babe Brother and
Junior struggle to lift Gideon. They almost stumble at the
door. Harry is left standing in the room alone.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Harry, Okra and Herman are trying to catch another chicken.
Herman is COUGHING badly and Okra is out of breath.

               OKRA 
     You think old Gideon is going to
     live to see this month out?

               HARRY 
     When I came upon the valley of
     bones, the serpent said, "Make this
     your home. Dry as my soul be,
     heaven is lost to thee." We all got
     to make way.

Harry puts the rooster face to the ground and draws a
straight line. Harry lets the rooster go, but the rooster
stays motionless, unable to move.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     A chicken hates to see the preacher
     coming to dinner.

Herman hands Harry the ax. Harry is poised over the chicken
with the ax, appreciating the moment. Harry raises the ax.
The SOUND of Rodney starting to practice his trumpet brings
the rooster out of the trance.

Before Harry can react, the rooster jumps away.

               OKRA 
     Herman, you will have to catch the
     next one 'cause I'm out of breath.

               HERMAN 
     If I have to chase after one, we
     won't eat.

A sack drops over the fence. Okra limps over to see what is
in the bag. He uses a stick to open the bag. He doesn't like
what he sees and throws the bag back over the fence.

INT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY

Suzie, Junior and Pat are standing around Gideon's bed. He is
in a room full of old veterans who are apparently nearing the
end.

Two old veterans, one white and the other black, sitting
opposite each other wearing medals, sit in silence staring
into each other's eyes.
A nurse empties an old man's urine bag. The old man doesn't
show any embarrassment about his predicament. Gideon looks at
how the patients are treated.

               GIDEON 
     I don't want to stay here. 
          (beat)
     Where is Babe Brother?

INT. HERMAN'S ONE ROOM HOUSE - DAY

M.C. is sitting on the bed, reading the job section of the
paper. Herman is putting Vicks Vapo-Rub in a bowl of boiling
water. He covers his head over the bowl with a towel. Okra is
sitting at the table examining his gun. He points it at the
floor, seeing if the sight is straight.

Harry is sitting at the table with Babe Brother. Harry is
showing him how to cheat at cards.

               HARRY 
     Never play with someone's else's
     cards. You always get a new deck.
     Look at this card. See anything?

               BABE BROTHER
     It is just a regular card.

               HARRY 
     Son, I can take everything you got
     with that deck. It is marked. Now
     I'm going to show you how to make
     some money in case you get stuck
     somewhere.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

A moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats
over everything. Suzie turns out the kitchen light and then
turns out the dining-room light. She goes to her room and
closes the door, leaving the room dark. A car headlight
passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the
wall.

The light reveals Harry's presence standing in the hall
doorway.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Gideon is being helped up the steps by his sons.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Suzie is holding the door open while Gideon is carried in by
Junior and Babe Brother. Gideon is led to a chair. He still
looks awful.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Doesn't he look a whole of lot
     better?

               SUZIE 
     Well, you look better than you did
     yesterday.

               GIDEON 
     Next time, I don't care how sick
     I'll be, don't take me back to the
     Veteran's Hospital.

Harry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath.
Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again.

               HARRY 
     Boy, I thought you were about to
     cross the river.

               GIDEON 
     I tell you, I feel like a ghost.

Harry signals Babe Brother to come over to him.

               HARRY 
     Son, would you do me a favor and
     see if you could turn off that tap
     in the bathroom. My hand is too
     weak. And would you do me another
     favor? I don't like asking this but
     would you clean the tub for me? I
     have trouble bending over.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Anytime you need someone to do
     something for you, just let me
     know.

Harry flops down on the couch. Suzie sets a cup of coffee on
the table for Gideon. Harry looks up from sharpening his
knife on a hand sharpening stone. He spits on it.

               HARRY 
     That smells like fresh coffee.

               SUZIE 
     Let me get you a cup?

               HARRY 
     Only if you can spare it.

Junior stands over Harry's shoulder looking at him sharpening
his knife. Harry feels uncomfortable with Junior standing
behind him. Harry looks up at him.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Son, would you get me an old piece
     of newspaper?

Suzie sets a cup of coffee in front of Harry.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Lord if you ain't an angel.

Junior hands Harry the newspaper. Harry puts the paper under
his foot and trims his toenails with it. Harry is aware of
Junior standing over him.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     I will leave you something in my
     will.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Junior looks in but Babe Brother is too busy trying to clean
the bathtub to notice anyone. Babe Brother complains to
himself.

               BABE BROTHER 
     What in the hell...

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Gideon and Suzie are in silhouette against the window.

The SOUND of the boy trying to play his horn next door
startles Gideon. Gideon turns to look out of the window
towards Mrs. Baker's house.

               GIDEON 
     It's good to be able to hear that.

               SUZIE 
     You must have been really sick.

               GIDEON 
     How is the garden doing?

               SUZIE 
     I need to get out there and get
     those weeds out.

               GIDEON 
     How is that hen doing? I was
     meaning to pip her before I fell
     sick.

He takes a deep breath and blows it out.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     I'm going to lie down. Take my,
     hand and help me up, lest I fall.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie helps Gideon to undress. Gideon loses hit balance but
catches himself on the side of the bed.

               GIDEON 
     Oh, I couldn't have last another
     day in that hospital. You get weary
     being in the old soldiers home, old
     soldiers and war stories. They wait
     to tell you their last story; the
     next morning the nurse pulls a
     sheet over their face.

INT. DINING ROOM, JUNIOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Junior is putting up a new light fixture. Pat hands him a
tool. Rhonda is washing dishes in the kitchen.

               PAT
     He just leeches off your parents.
     He is a master at wearing out
     welcome. 

               JUNIOR
     Harry is the kind of guy you would
     love to take out in the woods and
     leave under a rock. 

               PAT
     Where does her get the power to
     summon all his old raffish friends?
     They all smell of moth balls. 

Junior slips on the ladder and the wires touch. There is a
big spark. All the lights in the house go out. 

INT. BABE BROTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Linda is standing over the stove, sweating as she stirs a hot
pot of boiling soup.
Babe Brother and Harry are seated at the table playing cards.
Sunny is on the floor near his mother. Every time she move,
he follows her. Harry notices Sunny has his shoes on the
wrong foot and adds in a sarcastic way:

               HARRY
     How old is that boy?

Babe Brother looks at Sunny's shoe.

               BABE BROTHER
     Linda, how come you don't see that
     Sunny puts his shoes on right?

               LINDA 
     Why in the h...

Close to tears, she turns and with exaggerated care, puts the
spoon down and gently puts Sunny in a chair. She starts to
untie his shoes. Sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping
her eyes.

               HARRY 
     Let's give Dry Bones a call to see
     if he is coming or not. Okra likes
     to exaggerate, keep you waiting all
     night.

Harry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to
use the phone. Linda watches him go. She is deep in thought.

Babe Brother, attempting to cut the roast before it is ready,
is pushed aside by Linda, who is almost out of control with
rage.

               LINDA
     Why don't you wait?

Babe Brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast,
slings Linda's arm away. His hand accidentally hits her in
the eye.

Linda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of
herself She looks like a person who is on the verge of having
a breakdown. She goes back to putting the shoes on Sunny.

Babe Brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. He
automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. Linda
picks up Sunny.

INT. DINING ROOM - BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Linda is standing at the door, with a red eye, welcoming
Harry's friends, which seem to be a long line of sickly
people.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Linda is busy serving everyone, running in and out of the
kitchen bringing more things, and removing used plates, etc.
Linda's eye is swollen and discolored. The guests look at
Linda's eye and then cast a naughty-boy glance at Babe
Brother.

Linda stops serving to pay attention to an elderly man, who
deliberately bends one of her spoons. She catches another man
putting a fork in his pocket and an elderly lady putting a
cigarette out in one of her plates.

As she is about to confront the man about pocketing her
spoon, a peal of LAUGHTER forces her to turn around only to
witness a lady knocking over a glass filled with a green
drink with her elbow. The stain spreads across the table
cloth in an even manner like a single wave. She watches it
move from one end of the table to the other.

Harry is seated in the middle. The composition hints at The
Last Supper.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Linda is reading a book to Sunny, who has his coffee can of
marbles emptied on the bed. The NOISE from the party in the
next room is clearly heard. Every time she hears something
CRASHING to the floor, she wrenches. Babe Brother comes in
and stands in the doorway. Linda's eye is still swollen.

               BABE BROTHER 
     You okay?

               LINDA 
     I'm okay. Go back to your friends.

Babe Brother closes the door and leaves Linda reading stories
of Brer Rabbit to Sunny. She stops reading to look at him
playing marbles on the bed. She smiles.

EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY

Five weighty Women, dressed in church robes, and the Preacher
walk up Gideon's steps.

Suzie invites the church members in.

               PREACHER 
     Sister, we've come to see how you
     were doing. We came to ask if we
     could pray over Gideon.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY

Gideon is asleep. The church members gather around his bed.
The Preacher puts his hand on the foot of the bed and
discovers that there is something strange under the covers.
Suzie looks at him and lifts the covers at the foot of the
bed. Gideon's feet are resting on dead leaves.

               SUZIE 
     I put some Plummer Christian Leaves
     under his feet to draw the fever
     out.

               PREACHER 
     What else have you been giving him?

               SUZIE 
     I crossed his stomach with cold oil
     and gave him some cow tea.

               PREACHER 
     Suzie, I would think you would
     depend on prayer rather than these
     old fashion remedies. Let us read
     from the Bible.

The Preacher opens his Bible and reads silently. The choir
HUMS and begin to sway. Gideon's SNORING is very competitive.
The choir becomes louder. Gideon starts to TALK in his sleep.
Suzie is alarmed.

CLOSE UP GIDEON'S EAR.

THE SOUND OF A TRAIN WHISTLE IS HEARD.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PHOTO STUDIO, 1930 - DAY (DREAM EFX)

A lady steps upon the stage which has different backdrops.
She is the same lady in a photo that Gideon has hanging in
one of the kid's rooms. The photographer, who is off-screen,
asks about the background.

               PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) 
     What scene would you like in the
     background?

               LADY 
     Something pleasant.

               PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
     We have plantations.

The woman shakes her head.

               PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
     Natchez, cotton fields, Harlem,
     sunflowers, the Mississippi River.

               LADY 
     Put the river behind me.

A large picture of the Mississippi appears behind the lady.
It changes from a painted backdrop to a moving picture. There
is a storm developing off in the distance. The SOUND of
thunder is heard. The picture in the background then changes
to a boy on a mule.

EXT. WET DIRT ROAD - DAY (RAINING) (DREAM EFX)

The boy on the gray mule doesn't have a shirt on. A light
mist like rain covers him. Gideon walks along the picket
fence towards the boy on the mule.

Ahead of Gideon seems to be a puddle but as he approaches, he
discovers that it is an abyss. The boy and the mule on the
other side fade away. Everything FADES TO BLACK.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY

The Preacher turns a page in the Bible. Gideon has his mouth
open like a fish trying to get air. The Choir continues to
SING. The Preacher gets down on his knees and holds Gideon's
hand; he bows his head. The Choir stops singing. The Bessie
Smith recording of "Muddy Water" is coming from somewhere in
the house. The Preacher looks around. Suzie is more puzzled.
She goes to find where the music is coming from.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie knocks on the door. No one answers. She peeps in. No
one is in the room.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM

The Preacher and the choir all have their hands on Gideon.
Suzie enters the room.

               SUZIE 
     I don't know where that music is
     coming from.

INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Junior and Pat are helping Linda carry her baggage inside as
Sunny reluctantly follows. It is obvious that Linda has left
Babe Brother.

               SUNNY 
     I want my daddy.

               JUNIOR 
     Boy, hush that noise and get in
     this house. Make haste.

               SUNNY 
     I want my daddy; I told you.

               JUNIOR 
     Rhonda, drag him in here. If you be
     nice, I will take you to
     Disneyland.

Pat, Linda and Junior put the suitcases down.

               PAT 
     Now you don't have to say anything
     if you don't want to.

               JUNIOR 
     I want to hear what happened. My
     brother is a jackass and a damn
     fool. The both of you have been as
     scarce as hen's teeth.

Linda looks down, embarrassed.

               PAT 
     Rhonda, take Sunny in the backyard.
     Take a bowl so you can pick some
     strawberries. Sunny will enjoy it.

Rhonda and Sunny leave. Pat turns on Junior about talking bad
about Babe Brother and Linda in front of Sunny.

               PAT 
     You shouldn't talk about the boy's
     father in front of him. This is
     family business and we have to pull
     together.

               JUNIOR 
     Whether the boy hears it or not,
     the man is still a jackass.
     Everyone should have some mother
     wit.

               LINDA 
     Something just took control of him.
     He stays out all night and comes
     home with a pocket full of money.

               PAT 
     It's probably Harry, but I hate to
     mention his name, because every
     time we say something about him
     something bad happens.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Rhonda and Sunny are looking under a strawberry plant. Sunny
has strawberry stains around his mouth and on his shirt.
Rhonda is putting her strawberries in the bowl. After getting
a bowl full, they lay on the grass, eating strawberries while
looking up at the clouds slowly drifting by.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Babe Brother is driving along a country road while Harry,
sitting in the front seat next to him, yawns. Harry is tired.

               HARRY 
     Let us walk awhile. I grow weary
     when I sit still too long.

Babe Brother's car stops in an orchard-like area.

EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

Babe Brother and Harry get out of the car. They walk on a
path that takes them under low hanging tree limbs. It gets
darker as they go deeper into the orchard. Babe Brother finds
the going rough and loses his footing.

               HARRY 
     Give me your arm lest you fall.

Harry has to help him stay on his feet. Babe Brother finds it
necessary to take Harry's arm. Babe Brother stops and Harry
walks a few more steps ahead and waits for Babe Brother. Just
ahead sitting on a branch is a huge white owl camouflaged by
tree branches.

               BABE BROTHER
     I could swear I heard my son call
     me.

               HARRY 
     You probably heard the wind
     stirring up those dead leaves over
     there.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I heard his voice as clear as day.
     I better get back. Maybe something
     is wrong.

Babe Brother turns and starts hurrying back before Harry can
object. He walks slowly after Babe Brother who is doubling
the distance between himself and Harry as he runs through the
orchard to his car. Harry stops and looks around.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Pat, Linda and Junior are seated at the table. The suitcases
are in the middle of the floor.

               LINDA 
     I told Babe Brother that if Harry
     sets foot in our house again, I'm
     taking Sunny and leaving. Just as I
     said that, here come Harry and his
     old resurrected friends, hobbling
     up the steps.

               JUNIOR 
     Is that how you got that black eye?

               PAT 
     Don't ask that.

               LINDA 
     No, this was an accident.

               JUNIOR 
     Sure.

               LINDA 
     It was unintentional.

               JUNIOR 
     Babe Brother reminds me of the
     story of the man who wanted to be
     sizable. He wanted to be tall but
     what he was really short on was
     brains. There was a time when
     people had moon fever were treated
     with leeches.

The phone rings and Junior goes to pick it up. Linda's and
Pat's attention is focused on the phone. Junior hands the
phone to Linda.

               JUNIOR (CONT'D)
     It's that nut of yours.

Linda hesitates but Pat takes the phone from Junior and puts
it in her hand.

               LINDA 
     What do you want? 
          (beat)
     No. Nothing happened to him.

Sunny and Rhonda enter. Linda turns to look. Sunny's hands
and face look bloody from eating strawberries. She puts the
phone down and examines his dirty face. Pat brings Linda a
wet towel.

INT. THE BAKERS' GARAGE - NIGHT

MR. BAKER, a well built black man in his late 40's, is making
a new fishing pole. He is very involved. Mrs. Baker is
standing beside him with her arms folded. She stares at him.
Mr. Baker glances at her. 

               MR. BAKER
     What are you doing?

               MRS. BAKER 
     Counting the gray hairs in your
     head.

               MR. BAKER 
     Counting the what? What does that
     have to do with the price of
     butter?

               MRS. BAKER 
     I was just trying to make
     conversation.

               MR. BAKER 
     Where is Skip?

               MRS. BAKER 
     He is in his pigeon cage.

               MR. BAKER 
     I'm sorry he got those birds.

               MRS. BAKER 
     You know the man next door is near
     death.

Mr. Baker doesn't answer. He pauses for a moment of thought.
Mrs. Baker sees that she is not going to get a response from
her husband. She picks up an eyelet and Mr. Baker looks at
her as if to say, keep your hands off. She gets the message
and lays the eyelet back on the work bench.

               MRS. BAKER (CONT'D)
     He must have gotten rid of those
     chickens. You don't hear them
     crowing anymore... I kind of miss
     it now.

Mr. Baker admires his pole. He looks very closely at the
details of his work.

Rodney comes in, polishing his horn. Mr. Baker's expression
changes as he watches Rodney out of the corner of his eye.
Mrs. Baker gives Rodney a motherly pat on the head. Rodney
puts the trumpet to his mouth.

               MR. BAKER 
     Don't blow that thing in here. You
     blow that thing when I'm at work.

EXT. STREET - DAY

There is a man lying on a bus bench with his belongings. A
spotted dog is standing guard next to the bench. The dog's
reflection is caught in a puddle of water. The dog has
circles and sixes painted over his body.

Old John taps on the bench with his pipe. The man lying on
the bench stirs and gives Old John a wave to indicate that he
is alright. Old John slowly gets his cart moving again.

EXT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Babe Brother drives around the block past Junior's house.

INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Junior is at the window, looking out.

               JUNIOR 
     Why doesn't he just park his car
     and come in and apologize?

EXT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Babe Brother sits in his car with the windows up. Junior
tries to talk to him but Babe Brother will not roll down the
windows. He just stares at Junior, who is getting angry.

               JUNIOR 
     Roll down the window and let me
     talk to you.

Babe Brother only stares at him. Junior gets more violent and
starts to shake the car.

Pat calls from the doorway.

               PAT 
     Stop it Junior!

INT. PREGNANT WOMAN'S ROOM - DAY

A woman is in a squatting position. Suzie and her aide are
holding the woman by the arms.

EXT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY

Rhonda is painting her fingernails. Sunny watches her. She
looks around to see if any adult is watching. She tries to
talk Sunny into letting her paint his nails. He refuses but
she tries to pull his hand towards her. He fights his way
free and stands up and kicks the bottle of nail polish over.

               RHONDA 
     Mama, come see what Sunny did.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Suzie is sitting in a chair; her head is bent forward. Gideon
is TALKING in his sleep. She awakes and nods off again. Harry
sticks his head in.

               HARRY 
     How is he doing?

               SUZIE 
     As long as he keeps his throat
     clear, he is able to get some rest.

               HARRY 
     I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra
     and I thought you need a rest. I'll
     stand guard. Okra wants to talk to
     you anyway.

Harry helps Suzie to her feet.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Okra is painfully standing on his bad feet. He is in his
security-guard uniform, holding a bouquet of greens. As Suzie
comes in, Okra tries to stand upright at attention.

               OKRA 
     I brought you these greens and some
     salt meat.

               SUZIE 
     That is very thoughtful of you. I
     haven't had time to tend to my
     garden like I should.

Suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. She
squeezes Okra's hand as a thank you. She pours him a cup of
coffee. Okra eases down into the chair. He crosses his legs
and starts massaging his feet.

Suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. She
stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. Okra looks at her in
a slightly desirous way.

               OKRA 
     You know Gideon and I are lodge
     brothers and it has always been a
     policy to take care of the wives if
     something happens to our brother.

               SUZIE 
     You are very sweet, but Gideon has
     already taken care of everything in
     case something happens to him. He
     has a policy.

               OKRA 
     If you become a widow, you will
     need someone around to fix the
     whatnots. We like for the widow to
     marry someone in the lodge. I know
     Gideon ain't gone yet, but there
     will be a lot of his old friends
     coming around to get in line. I
     just want you to consider this as a
     kind of a conditional proposal, to
     be first in line so to speak.

Suzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to
say. She stands up.

               SUZIE 
     Excuse me. I have to go feed my
     dog.

She turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits
the back door.

Okra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet.

INT. BEDROOM / EXT. YARD - NIGHT

Harry is sitting by the bed, just visible through the window.
He seems restless.

EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY

There is only one hen left in the coop. The garden is full of
weeds. The sunflowers are bent by the force of the wind. A
bag is thrown over the fence.

The shadows of pigeons flying overhead race along the ground.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Two shadows on the wall are facing each other. The shadows
are the heads of two women, Suzie and Hattie.

               HATTIE 
     You know Harry lied about how that
     boy Hocker got kilt. And it was
     Harry who saw Emory last before
     they found him hanging over a levee
     like someone would hang a hog.

               SUZIE 
     I remember Harry always trying to
     help someone. He got Lulla's
     daughter out of trouble. He was
     always running to the store for
     someone who couldn't leave the
     house.

               HATTIE 
     Harry always shows his good side
     and, like the moon, the other side
     is black. Back home he always did
     try to act like the colored
     gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is
     nothing but evil. I'm warning you --
     you can't keep a wild animal as a
     pet around children.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DAY

Harry has a plate of food in his hand. He stands facing
himself in the mirror, staring at himself while he eats. He
opens the door to leave but Sunny is in the hallway with his
back turned sweeping. Harry stares at him and decides to go
back in his room.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               SUZIE 
     You know Okra asked me to marry him
     the other evening.

               HATTIE 
     Rush your mouth, girl. No, he
     didn't. He cannot be that big of a
     damn fool.

               SUZIE 
     I asked Harry about it. He didn't
     own up to it. He said he didn't
     know what got into Okra.

               HATTIE 
     He's just raffish. Harry put him up
     to it. Before evening sun sets, I
     would have his belongings back on
     Route 55, that old fox.

               SUZIE 
     I can't accuse him just dry long
     80.

               HATTIE
     Everybody who have been associated
     with Harry end up with pennies over
     their eyes.

               SUZIE 
     What must I do?

               HATTIE 
     If it was left up to me, I would
     poison him.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Harry sees that it is safe to leave. He sees Sunny sweeping
in Gideon's room. Gideon is sound asleep. Sunny is sweeping
around the bed.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Harry comes in and Hattie and Suzie stop talking. Harry is
aware that he was the subject. The SOUND of the boy next door
playing his horn is heard.

               HARRY 
     Good afternoon, ladies.

               SUZIE
     Good afternoon to you.

Harry waits for Hattie to respond but it is obvious that
Hattie isn't about to speak to him.

               HATTIE 
     I'm going to check on Gideon.

Harry moves out of her way to let her go by. Hattie doesn't
even give him a glance. Harry continues to look at her as she
disappears into Gideon's room.

               HARRY 
     As God is my witness, I have never
     done anything to that woman.

               SUZIE 
     You must have done something to
     her.

               HARRY 
     Since she has repented, all she
     does is throw stones.

               SUZIE 
     Hattie is a different person now.

               HARRY 
     I don't make no bones about where
     I'm going to spend eternity. I have
     always been wild and you know that.
     If you are made to feel half a man,
     what do you think the other half
     is?

               SUZIE 
     I'm glad you brought that up as to
     who you are. I have to know who is
     in my house.

               HARRY 
     You invited me.

               SUZIE 
     Only if you are a good man, a
     friend. Are you a friend?

Harry takes his time in looking for an answer.

               HARRY 
     Like that boy next door playing
     that his horn. If he was a friend,
     he would stop irritating people,
     but if he stops practicing, he
     wouldn't be perfect in what he does
     someday.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Hattie enters Harry's room. She goes through his things. She
reads one of his letters. As she walks over to the window
reading his letter, she steps on the plate, cracking it.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               SUZIE 
     I want you to leave.

Harry looks sad and suddenly a lot older as if what she said
has taken away some of his life.

               HARRY 
     Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go
     back home with me. 
          (beat)
     Suzie, I'm not a bad fellow; I just
     like to have a good time. 
          (beat)
     M.C. is coming by to pick me up
     tonight. I'll come back to get my
     things. Well, I hope Gideon
     recovers. You know I have an extra
     picture of one of my sons that I
     would like for you to put with
     those baby pictures over your
     dresser. It's better than being in
     my dusty wallet with addresses and
     names of people who are no longer
     on this earth.

Suzie takes the picture. She seems as if she has doubts about
having asked Harry to leave.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     I'll say my so-longs to Gideon
     before I leave and I truly wish
     that he will get well.

Suzie continues to look at the picture.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Hattie is reading Harry's letters when he appears behind her.
Hattie turns but is not surprised or concerned about Harry.
She hands him back his letters, looks at him for a moment and
goes. Harry looks down at the cracked dish.

INT. HERMAN'S HOUSE - EVENING (RAIN)

M.C. and Herman are packing. Okra is all dressed up with a
pair of Stacy Adams shoes that make his feet look
exaggeratedly long. Babe Brother and Harry are sitting at a
table playing blackjack. Okra picks up one thing at a time,
making the packing much harder. There is a stack of old dusty
78 record; Okra, trying to step over the records, kicks over
a box of mothballs that roll across the floor. Okra has to
step over boxes of toilet paper.

               OKRA 
     Why did you buy so much toilet
     paper?

               M.C.
     I got that on the job when I was a
     janitor. They didn't pay me.

Harry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice,
shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife,
a crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the
knife.

               HARRY 
     Whose old piece of knife is this?

               HERMAN 
     That was my brother's knife.

Harry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put
it in his pocket.

The SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it.

               HARRY 
     I don't want to wear out welcome,
     but you can stay in someone's heart
     longer than you can stay in their
     house. Come with us, boy. We are
     going to have a good time.

               BABE BROTHER 
     This would be a bad time for me to
     leave.

               HARRY 
     We are going where the action is.
     Ain't that right, Okra?
          (then back to Babe
          Brother)
     Let's play for a couple of bucks
     unless you want to start off with
     two bits and work our way up.
          (beat)
     What would you give to be rich?

Babe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his
hand.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Had Moms and Pops given me my share
     of what was mine, I could have been
     rich by now. Linda and I had it all
     worked out.

Harry wins the first hand.

               HARRY 
     I know your mind is on your wife
     but you should never treat a woman
     as an equal. You want to get your
     wife back, get another woman, one
     of those big hip women that will
     ride you till you sweat.

Harry wins another hand. M.C. and Okra are still packing
while Herman is eating Argo Starch.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Double the stakes?

Babe Brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere
else. Harry studies his hand and looks at Babe Brother; he
puts down his hand. Babe Brother wins and is quite pleased.
The next series of hands are won by Babe Brother.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     M.C., you ever heard of a real man
     having one woman?

               M.C. 
     No, lord!

               HARRY 
     When one woman puts you out, you
     have another to take you in. You
     don't drive around without a spare
     tire, do you? The more mules you
     have hitched, the easier it is to
     plough.

Harry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile
of money.

               HARRY 
     Herman, let me borrow a few bucks.

Herman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off
several.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Bless you. Bless you.

Herman is standing behind Babe Brother, SINGING to himself.

               HERMAN 
     In the ground there is a hole and
     green grass growing around the
     hole. Now in the hole there is tree
     and green grass growing all around
     the tree. Now there is a hole in
     the ground, a tree in the hole and
     green grass growing around the
     hole.

               HARRY 
     Let me share something with you.

Harry stops and thinks for a while.

               HARRY (CONT'D)
     Hattie is a snake. That woman broke
     up so many homes and caused a lot
     of misery and because she calls
     herself getting religion everything
     is put right.

Okra is taking several shotguns out of the closet.

               OKRA 
     These damn things are unloaded,
     ain't they?

               HARRY 
     It's important to know the
     difference between the incoming
     fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos
     and Andy might say, "We is the
     outgoing fire." Come with us, son.
     We'll show you some steaming hot
     juke joints, steaming hot women.

               M.C. 
     A pot full of chitlins and a good
     time.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Let me go by the house first.

               HARRY 
     We will wait for you as long as we
     can. I got to get my things from
     your mother's house.

Babe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in
chairs and on the bed and look at their watches.

Harry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and
WHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that
Babe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of
concern comes over his face.

EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)

It is raining hard. Babe Brother gets out of the car. Running
to get out of the rain, he slips and falls; he tries to get
up but slips and falls again. He gets up and walks slowly up
the steps as if he doesn't care whether he gets wet or not.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Suzie helps him to take his wet coat off. She goes into the
kitchen, puts his coat in front of the stove. The knife falls
out. She picks it up and looks at it like she would throw it
away but Babe Brother takes it.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I need to get my suitcase out of
     the garage.

               SUZIE 
     What for?

               BABE BROTHER 
     I'm going back home with Harry.

               SUZIE 
     I've heard some foolish things in
     my life.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Harry is coming to pick me up.

               SUZIE 
     Have you lost your mind? Have you
     thought about your wife and child,
     not to mention your sick father?
     And I need your help to move his
     bed from under the leak in the
     ceiling.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I'm busy.

               SUZIE 
     Don't make me raise my hand to you.
     You have to see for yourself that
     you are going in the wrong
     direction.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Can't I be myself without you
     jumping in with your right and
     wrong? The world is not black and
     white. Show me one perfect person.
     If you can't, don't ask me to be.

               SUZIE 
     I do have a right to ask you to be
     a little bit better than me and
     your father because we gave you a
     better head start. You have no
     right to complain to us about your
     not having enough. 
          (forcefully)
     You sit right there with your no
     manners self.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)

Junior is carrying a roll of roofing paper. Pat, Rhonda,
Linda and Sunny run to the porch to get out of the rain.
Junior stacks the roofing paper in the corner of the porch
and stamps the mud off his shoes.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Junior, Pat, Linda and Rhonda come in to help Suzie move the
bed from under the rain dripping through the hole in the
ceiling.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

Sunny stands in the doorway watching his father sharpen his
knife that he got from Harry. Babe Brother is unaware that
his son is watching him.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

               JUNIOR 
     Where is Babe Brother?

               SUZIE 
     Brother is in the kitchen.

               JUNIOR 
     How come you didn't ask Babe
     Brother to help you?

               SUZIE 
     He said he was busy. He is mad
     'cause he wanted to get in the
     garage to get his things so he
     could go with Harry.

Linda has a surprised look on her face.

               JUNIOR 
     So he is busy?

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

Babe Brother is preoccupied sharpening his knife with a
sharpening stone. He is almost in a trance. Junior comes in
rather angrily. Sunny goes and sits in the shadows in the
dining room.

               JUNIOR 
     Why in the hell didn't you help
     mama?

               BABE BROTHER 
     I told her I would if she would
     give me time.

               JUNIOR 
     I bet you if your master would have
     told you to fix the hole in the
     roof, you would have rebuilt the
     whole damn house.

               BABE BROTHER 
     You always got the best of it
     around here and when Dad always
     talks about my son, it is always
     you, so you fix the roof.

               JUNIOR 
     That is a damn lie and you know it.
     Every time father asks you to do
     something, you either half-ass do
     it or run off and hide. Mama asked
     you to turn the dirt in her garden
     and you told her, with your smart
     ass self, that you weren't a
     farmer; get Junior to do it. Every
     time someone asks you to do
     something, you always say, tell
     Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to
     grow up.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I told you about calling me boy. I
     ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got
     a bad habit of calling me boy. You
     call me boy in front of my wife.
     You think I'm going to fix the
     roof? I hope the wind blows the
     whole damn thing off and it pours
     down rain.

               JUNIOR
     I ought to break your damn neck.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Sunny is sitting in a chair listening to his father and uncle
argue in the kitchen. A car outside passes and the lights
from the car form a crochet-like moving pattern on the wall
behind him. Sunny is only lit for a moment.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

Babe Brother starts gathering up his things to leave.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I'm leaving and don't even call me
     when the shoe falls 'cause all he
     did for me was to try and run my
     life. I'm tired of people saying
     Babe Brother this, Babe Brother
     that. What's my name?

               JUNIOR 
     You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.

               BABE BROTHER 
     My name is Sam. Samuel.

Babe Brother attempts to get up but Junior pushes him down.

               JUNIOR 
     Sit down!

Babe Brother hits Junior on the jaw, driving him backwards,
causing the overhead lamp to sway violently.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Suzie, Pat and Linda hear the noise coming from the kitchen
and rush to see what is going on.

INT. KITCHEN - RAINY NIGHT

Babe Brother and Junior are both reaching for the knife.
Junior is on top of Babe Brother, who is stretched out on the
table trying to reach the knife. Junior grabs the knife first
and Babe Brother flips over to defend himself. Babe Brother
grabs Junior's wrist as Junior tries to push the knife
against his throat.

Suzie comes in and grabs part of the knife with her hand and
Junior's wrist with her other hand. Pat and Linda try to pull
the two men apart while pleading with Junior.

Blood drips from Suzie's hand to the table, forming a pool
under Babe Brother's head.

               PAT 
     Stop it! Stop it! Look what you are
     doing!

Babe Brother's eyes are rolled to the back. Junior's eyes are
huge; he has an animal look on his face. The SOUND of
struggling people breathing heavily is amplified. The pool of
blood on the table grows larger.

Junior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body
relaxes. He calmly releases the knife.

Junior takes his mother's hand.

               JUNIOR 
     Someone get some lard out of the
     ice box.

Pat attempts to get the lard but pain in her stomach forces
her to sit down. Linda gets the lard out and hands it to
Junior. Babe Brother raises himself. The blood from Suzie's
dripping from his head. Rhonda is trying to hold Sunny back.

Junior holds his mother's hand under the faucet. It is a deep
cut. The bleeding won't stop.

Pat is sitting at the blood-stained table unable to move. She
is PANTING, sweating, and holding her stomach. Linda is
caught between trying to help Suzie and attending to Pat.

Babe Brother helps to make a wad of cloth to press in her
hand to Stop the bleeding.

               LINDA 
     You are going to need some
     stitches. We better take her to the
     emergency hospital.

Babe Brother is shamefully calm now and very humble.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I'll drive her to the hospital.

               JUNIOR 
     We will take her. You all stay here
     and watch Dad.

               LINDA 
     What about Pat?

               PAT 
     I'm okay now.

Suzie attempts to go see Gideon but Babe Brother and Junior
turn her to the door. Going through the kitchen door, Junior
intentionally turns his back to Babe Brother. Babe Brother
stares at Junior's back as he walks ahead.

INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

The automatic doors open and Junior, Babe Brother and Suzie
enter. There is a long line of people waiting at the
registration window as well as groups of people filling out
forms. Other patients are seated and waiting patiently to see
the doctor.

Suzie finally gets to the registration window. A NURSE,
white, 25, with extremely long fingernails that curve back
around, is surprisingly sympathetic.

               NURSE 
     What sort of emergency are you here
     for?

               SUZIE 
     I cut my hand.

               NURSE 
     Let me take a look at it.

Suzie puts her hand through the window. The Nurse stands up
to get a better look. The Nurse takes the wad out of her
hand. The bleeding has stopped.
The Nurse takes a deep breath. The Nurse glances up to notice
the blood stains on the back of Babe Brother head.

               NURSE (CONT'D)
     Are you all together?

               JUNIOR 
     Yes.

               NURSE 
     The bleeding has stopped but it
     will need stitches. You will have
     to fill out this form. How will
     this be covered, insurance, cash or
     check?

               JUNIOR 
     Don't worry about it. It will be
     paid. Just let her see a doctor.

               SUZIE 
     I have Medicare.

The Nurse hands Suzie a form, but Babe Brother takes the
form. The Nurse looks again at Babe Brother's head.

               NURSE 
     Do you need to see the doctor too?

               BABE BROTHER 
     No, just my mother.

Babe Brother fills out the form with Suzie's help and hands
the form back to the Nurse.

They find a seat all together.

                                   DISSOLVE:

INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

The room slowly fills with people and Babe Brother and Junior
offer their seats to those there for medical care.

                                   DISSOLVE:

INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Two Police Officers bring in a man handcuffed to a bed. The
woman officer carries a shotgun. The male police officer
carries a clip board. The Prisoner is obviously in no
condition to escape or cause trouble. They are allowed to go
directly to the emergency room without waiting.

                                   DISSOLVE:

INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

More injured people come but in spite of their condition they
are told that they have to wait. There is only standing room.

Junior and Babe Brother are standing next to the wall.

On the other side of the room, Suzie is looking quietly at
them as if she is in deep thought.

Junior walks over to the reception desk.

               JUNIOR 
     Why is it so crowded?

               NURSE 
     Well, it is Friday night and a full
     moon.

Junior whispers to Babe Brother. They both start to laugh.

Suzie looks up and finds them in a fit of laughter. A faint
smile appears on her face.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

Gideon is slowly getting up. He looks around. He calls for
Suzie. He slowly gets to his feet.

               GIDEON 
     Suzie, I'm hungry.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

He walks by Linda, Pat, Rhonda, and Sunny, who are sleeping
in chairs, on the floor and on the sofa.

               GIDEON 
     Suzie.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

Gideon opens the refrigerator and starts taking out bowls of
food and placing them on the table. He puts on a pot of
coffee.

               GIDEON 
     Suzie.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) (LATER)

Gideon is busy eating almost everything in sight. A group of
mystified and sleepy faces appear at the door. Pat, Linda,
Rhonda and Sunny are all looking rather dumbfounded.

EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

Everything is wet from the night's rain. The garden looks
more like a graveyard. Moisture drips from the sunflowers.

Gideon's nervous looking rooster jumps the fence and starts
to CROW.

Skip is out early throwing rocks at his birds. The rocks land
on Gideon's roof.

EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

Babe Brother and Junior help Suzie out of the car. She has
her left hand bandaged. They are extremely exhausted. They
walk up the porch to find Harry holding the door open.

               HARRY 
     I can't believe what I heard took
     place.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

On seeing Suzie, Sunny jumps up, knocking the can of marbles
over the kitchen floor. He runs to give Suzie a hug. Sunny
wants to touch her bandaged hand, but Linda stops him.

               SUZIE 
     How is Gideon doing?

               RHONDA 
     He is asleep now, but he was up all
     night eating.

As Suzie goes to Gideon's room, she comes face to face with
Harry. She doesn't say anything.

               HARRY
     I came to pick up my things.

INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY

Gideon is SNORING loudly. On the night-stand is a plate with
food left on it. Suzie feels his forehead.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Harry sadly gets up. He looks at Babe Brother. Linda steps in
front of Babe Brother.

               LINDA 
     You ought to go see how your father
     is doing and then wash that blood
     off you and change shirts.

Babe Brother is surrounded by Linda and Sunny who has his
eyes fixed on Harry. They move as one heading for the
bedroom.

Harry seems a lot older. He sadly walks towards the kitchen
with his coffee cup.

LOW ANGLE SHOT: Harry is slowly walking towards the MARBLES
that are scattered over the kitchen floor.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Pat, Linda, Junior, Rhonda, Babe Brother, Sunny and Suzie are
all standing around waiting for Gideon to wake up.

               SUZIE 
     Gideon.

Gideon's only response is to SNORE louder.

               PAT 
     How long is Harry going to hang
     around?

Babe Brother is in a corner all by himself. He looks down
when Pat asks the question about Harry.

A loud CRASHING SOUND comes from the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Harry is trying to raise himself from the floor. He pauses
for a moment and then collapses. Harry is in a lot of pain.
Harry's body contorts and then remains still.

Babe Brother, Junior, Pat, and Linda, Suzie run in. Suzie
tries to see if he is alive. Babe Brother tries to give him
mouth to mouth resuscitation but Linda pulls him away. Junior
tries to push down on Harry's chest.

Babe Brother stares down at Harry and then goes slowly back
into the living room. Pat is on the phone dialing the
paramedics. Everyone stands around Harry.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Two PARAMEDICS work on Harry. One of the paramedics is a
young Asian. The other is white with red hair. They listen
for a heart beat and shake their heads in a negative manner.
They pack up their medical case. The Asian's accent is very
difficult to understand.

               WHITE PARAMEDIC 
     There is nothing we can do for him.

The Paramedics start to leave without the body.

               JUNIOR 
     Well, aren't you going to take him
     with you?

               ASIAN PARAMEDIC 
     If he had died in our care, we
     would be required to take him.
     Since we found him dead, you will
     have to wait for the county to pick
     him up.

               JUNIOR 
     How long will that take?

               WHITE PARAMEDIC 
     That would depend on how busy it
     is. I'm sorry.

Harry is stretched out on the floor. A blanket covers
everything except his shoes.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

Hattie, Marsh, Okra, Herman, and M.C. all come in. Marsh
looks cheerful.

               MARSH 
     What happened?

               JUNIOR 
     He slipped on some marbles that
     were on the floor. Then his heart
     gave out.

               LINDA 
          (to Sunny)
     I told you to always put those
     marbles up and not to leave them
     just anywhere.

               PAT 
     The poor thing is not to blame.
     Rhonda, take Sunny for a walk.

Marsh hands Rhonda several dollars.

               MARSH 
     Here, go around to the store and
     buy what you want.

               HATTIE 
     Would anybody object if I take a
     look at him?

               HERMAN 
     I don't think Harry would like it.

Hattie goes over and pulls the blanket back. Okra, M.C. and
Herman hurry over to take a quick glance. They huddle behind
Hattie, peeping over her shoulder.

               HATTIE 
     I never noticed how big his eyes
     were.

                                   DISSOLVE:

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

Linda is helping Babe Brother wash Suzie's blood out of his
hair. She dries his hair with a towel. Sonny hands Babe
Brother a clean shirt, Gideon's shirt. He puts it on.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gideon is sitting on the edge of his bed looking through the
scraps of leftovers on his plate. He puts his pants on. As he
moves about, his joints SNAP and POP. He picks up the empty
plate.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Babe Brother is on the phone with the county morgue. He gets
into an argument with the people on the other end of the
phone.

               BABE BROTHER 
     Mister... Mister... Excuse me for
     cutting you off but we pay taxes
     too. We should not have to pay you
     to take a 24-hour lunch break.

Babe Brother hands the phone to Linda.

               BABE BROTHER (CONT'D)
     The coroner said that he was out
     here, and knocked on the door and
     no one was here.

Junior steps over the body, holding a pot of coffee in his
hand.

The Preacher is sitting with Suzie talking in a low voice.

Pat, Rhonda and Sunny come in with boxes of chicken snack.

Linda hangs up the phone.

               LINDA 
     He doesn't know when he will be out
     this way again. Somebody downtown
     is going to hear about this.

               M.C. 
     They just do that in the colored
     neighborhood. If he had been white,
     they would had him on his feet and
     out of here.

               PAT 
     I got white meat and I got dark
     meat. I know it sounds cruel but we
     have to eat.

Gideon comes in walking very slowly, holding his plate out.
Everyone is shocked. Gideon is completely unaware of the
period that he has been sick.

               GIDEON 
     What, are you having another party?

               SUZIE 
     You better come sit down. You are
     still sick.

               GIDEON 
     Gal, you're talking to John Henry.
     When was I sick?

               JUNIOR 
     You have been out for almost three
     weeks.

The Preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes Gideon's
hand.

               PREACHER 
     We had long conversations with the
     Lord about you. Didn't we, Sister
     Suzie? I said we need him down
     here, Lord.

Gideon smiles in appreciation. He pushes his plate out to
Pat, indicating that he wants it filled with chicken. Gideon
is about to bite into the chicken when he notices Harry's
feet sticking out. He points with the chicken in his hand. He
has a mystified look on his face.

               OKRA 
     That's our friend Harry.

               GIDEON 
     Not our Harry?

               OKRA 
     I wish it wasn't.

Gideon seems to weaken for a moment.

               GIDEON 
     What happened to him?

               HATTIE
     He dropped dead.

               HERMAN
     Hattie, you can be so mean.

               GIDEON
     How long has he been dead?

               SUZIE
     Since this morning.

               GIDEON
     What happened to your hand?

               SUZIE
     I cut it on an old rusty knife.

Gideon is deeply concerned.

               GIDEON
     What did you put on it?

               SUZIE
     It's healing now.

Gideon looks over at his two sons as if to ask them about it.

               GIDEON
     I hope you will take care of your
     mother better than that when I'm
     gone.

Junior and Babe Brother both have their heads down. Linda and
Sunny move closer to Babe Brother.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     Babe Brother, is that my shirt that
     you're wearing?

               BABE BROTHER
     Yes.

               GIDEON
     How come you're not wearing my
     shoes?

               BABE BROTHER
     They're too big.

Gideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards
Harry.

               GIDEON 
     When is the undertaker coming?

               LINDA 
     They can't say. I'll try calling
     them again.

Hattie moves closer to Herman and speaks so only he can hear.

               HATTIE 
     Why don't M.C. and you drag him to
     your house?

Herman moves away with a look of disdain.

               MARSH 
     Harry didn't have any relatives
     living, did he?

               M.C. 
     Harry was in the world by himself.

               MARSH 
     Somebody has to take responsibility
     for him.

               PAT 
     Why don't you look through his
     things to see if you can find a
     number?

Okra, Marsh, Hattie, Herman, and M.C. go to Harry's room,
leaving Suzie and Gideon sitting opposite each other with the
door to the kitchen separating them. Junior, the Preacher and
Pat are eating chicken. Linda is on the phone trying to get
through to the morgue.

               LINDA 
     How do you like that? They hung up
     in my face. I'll fix them. I'll
     show them just how mean I can get.

She rapidly dials the number. There is a BUSY SIGNAL.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     This has been a nightmare.

INT. BEDROOM - RIGHT

M.C. and Marsh are going through Harry's boxes. They take out
old blues records, books, a big Bible, and books on Dunbar.

               MARSH 
     These are letters to his son.

Hattie reads the letters in a corner by herself. She stops
reading for a moment.

               HATTIE 
     I still don't know if I was right
     about Harry.

She seems frustrated with herself not being able to come to
terms about who was Harry.

EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT

A crowd of people are standing around looking at Gideon's
house.

INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

The Preacher is sleep in his chair, SNORING loudly. Babe
Brother and Linda are sitting together, talking in almost a
whisper. Sunny is asleep in his lap. Babe Brother is finding
it difficult to apologize for his recent behavior.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I have more sense than to give up
     everything, my family, you and
     Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the
     real me inside my body. I'm glad
     it's over. It's like a veil has
     been lifted.

               LINDA 
     Like a veil has been lifted?

               BABE BROTHER 
     It's like I've been swimming in
     muddy waters.

               LINDA 
     Like muddy waters?

               BABE BROTHER 
     It was like all those things old
     country people try to tell you what
     hell is like.

               LINDA 
     You were in hell?

               BABE BROTHER 
     I couldn't believe the things I was
     doing. It was like an internal
     struggle going on inside my body.

               LINDA 
     Do you think you won?

               BABE BROTHER 
     It was nip and tuck.

               LINDA 
     And what lesson have we learned
     from all of this, Babe Br... Sam...
     I mean Samuel?

               BABE BROTHER 
     I guess it proves you really care
     about me. You hung in there.

Linda looks at Babe Brother for a length of time.

               GIDEON 
     When are you boys going to fix that
     roof?

               BABE BROTHER 
     Soon as I rest a bit. 
          (beat)
     I meant as soon as we are back to
     normal again, anytime.

               GIDEON 
     Here I am thinking about myself
     when poor Harry is resting on the
     floor of the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Harry's body lies there motionless.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

The Preacher is SNORING violently.

Babe Brother is asleep on the floor. Sunny is asleep sitting
on Linda's lap. Linda's feet rest on Babe Brother's chest.

Junior and Pat are looking at the baby pictures. Pat is
holding her hand across her stomach feeling the baby kick.
Rhonda is asleep in a chair.

Suzie and Gideon are sitting at the dining room table. Suzie
is cutting the dead leaves off of a small potted plant.

               SUZIE 
     It feels like a storm has passed...
     Hattie read some of Harry's letters
     to a woman he had a child by. The
     child had died and he was writing
     to give her some comfort. Hattie
     didn't know that deep down at the
     bottom of Harry's hate, there was
     some love.

The SOUND of Rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer
irritating.

               GIDEON 
     Did I ever tell you the story about
     the man who wanted to make his own
     mind up about heaven and hell? He
     didn't want nobody's opinion but
     his own.

Suzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her
potted plant. Gideon looks over at the Preacher, who is still
asleep.

               GIDEON (CONT'D)
     He's going to check out heaven
     first. He gets a round trip ticket
     to heaven. He gets in heaven and
     finds it just like back home.
     People dripping with sweat, working
     in the fields, hardly surviving. He
     asked a man who was getting a drink
     of water, "I thought the streets
     were paved with gold." "They are
     but you won't see them," he said.
     "Boy, you got to work day and night
     cause idleness is sinfulness." So
     he takes the other half of his
     ticket and takes the express to
     hell. He sees people stretched out
     on their backs kicking back,
     picking their teeth. "Man, this is
     a dream." He asked, "What's you'll
     doing?" They all hollered back,
     "Sinning." The devil was shaking
     hands with everyone and came up to
     him and said, "Please to meet you."
     He asked, "I thought you'll was
     supposed to be burning in fire."
     Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire
     down here except under that pot of
     chitlins." The man was going go ask
     the preacher back on earth...

               SUZIE 
     I don't want to hear any joke about
     colored people being in hell.
     You're being irreverent.

               GIDEON 
     I'm almost finished. I'm about to
     come to the punch line.

               SUZIE 
     I don't want to hear any tales
     about colored people...

               GIDEON 
     But these are white people,
     anybody. The punch...

               SUZIE 
     I don't care to hear any jokes
     about people being in hell. This
     cut on my hand reminds me that it
     is nothing to laugh at.

               GIDEON 
     It's only a tale.

The RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly. Harry's body
starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up.
Everyone is frozen. Babe Brother and Linda remain asleep. The
rocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them.

M.C., Herman, Okra and Hattie and Marsh enters the dining
room. Harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.

               M.C 
     Is that an earthquake?

               HERMAN 
     It's something.

Babe Brother wakes in a sweat and sits next to Linda like a
child needing protection.

               BABE BROTHER 
     I'm cold. I need to get out into
     the sunlight.

               JUNIOR 
     What is it, noontime?

               PREACHER
     I wonder how they going to bury
     this man.

               HATTIE 
     Plant him in Potter's Field. He
     doesn't need a marked grave.

               HERMAN
     Hattie, your true colors are
     unbearable. You got some mean ways.
     Don't worry about the boy getting a
     burial. He still has some friends
     left on this earth.

               HATTIE 
     His winter has come and gone and I
     know right now he is answering for
     a lot of things.

M.C., Okra and Herman move away from Hattie.

               PREACHER 
     It is my job to pray for his soul
     and I would like to do that.

EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY

Rhonda is sitting next to Sunny on the front porch. She has
an angry expression. Sunny is trying to please her by
offering her his airplane.
He pushes the airplane near her and she pushes it back with a
violent shove. He persists in offering her his airplane.

A crowd of people is still standing around in front of
Gideon's house.

               MAN 
     Hey boy, you still got that dead
     man in your house.

Sunny and Rhonda don't respond. A middle-aged woman,
VIRGINIA, one of Gideon's neighbors, passes Sunny and Rhonda,
knocks on the screen door and goes in.

INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

               VIRGINIA 
     I know you all haven't had a chance
     to cook or do anything with that
     dead man in your kitchen. You must
     be starved to death. Some of your
     neighbors have got together and we
     set up a picnic table in my
     backyard with food and everything
     to feed all you all.

               SUZIE 
     Virginia, that is so wonderful of
     you all!

               MARSH 
     If the dead wagon comes, we ought
     to leave a note telling them we'll
     be down the street at a picnic.

Gideon comes back in with Suzie, who is helping tie his tie.
They all line up and file out the front door with Suzie and
Gideon leading the way. Pat is holding her stomach with a
thoughtful look on her face.

               PAT 
     I think we better be ready.

Junior looks concerned as he follows Pat out the door. Sunny
follows Rhonda, who is still mad at him. Babe Brother and
Linda are the last ones out. Babe Brother takes a long look
in the direction of Harry as Linda pulls him out. She slams
the door.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Harry's body lies on the floor. On the kitchen sink are
Suzie's jars of cuttings, which have developed a maze of
roots.

                     THE END
