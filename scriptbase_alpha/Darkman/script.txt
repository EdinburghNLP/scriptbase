          INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY


          BANG!!
          A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

                         CLOSE SHOT:
          A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy
          but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
          His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
          man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
          His name is EDDIE BLACK.
          In the distance a foghorn moans.
          We are pulling back.

                         BLACK
          Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
          him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell
          fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...
          The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
          empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
          his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
          space.
          The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
          falling into darkness.

                         BLACK
          No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy
          comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me
          outs my property... Does it matter?
          Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...
          Another hard-looking man is approaching.

          for those fuckers.

          We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is
          swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln
          Continentals.
          The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
          eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

          is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky

          protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.

          bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring
          of white chalky fluid coats his lips.

          11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11
          Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.
          Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're
          ready to kick some ass.

          Okay, against the car, ladies. You're
          c gonna stand for a search.
          12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12
          hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them
          down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

                         DOCK WORKER #2
          Bunch a cuties.

          From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The
          visitors bare up in silence.

          The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for
          the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he
          continues to hop in place for balance.
          Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is
          dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.
          Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there
          is now...total silence.

          the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a
          gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of
          the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth.
          As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

                         DURANT
          Now let's consider my points, one by
          one...

          ...Two: I don't always succeed.
          SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:

          ...Three: I've got seven more points.

          EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE
          We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus
          again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern,
          every blemish a mountain.

          As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of
          densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins
          allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer
          command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed
          evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the
          wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to
          programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic
          substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

          But still this ninety nine minute.
          Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.

          Pacing, thinking;

                         PEYTON
          Why? What is destabilizing it?
          Vivification process was cake. Tissue
          rejection? We licked
          that. We're close. We're smart guys.
          So why can't we make these cells
          stable? Hokay. Let's try a
          ten percent alkalinity. Get those
          suckers too drunk to fragment.

                         YAKITITO
          posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds
          of similar sheets.

                         YAKITITO
          We already try ten.
          He pokes at a section of lab sheets.

                         YAKITITO
          And twenty. And twenty-two... We try

          BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again.
          Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly
          bobs.

                         PEYTON
          A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get
          emotionally involved. Watch.
          Analyze. Remain object ---

          BAM!
          He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and
          again to punctuate his speech.

                         YAKITITO

          Quick, Yakitito.
          A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to

          CAMERA.

                         YAKITITO
          Catches the ball.

          The answer, Yakitito.

                         YAXITITO
          snags the ball angrily from the air.

                         YAKITITO

                         (FURIOUS)
          It is most strongly depending on
          temperature!
          He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes
          Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.

                         PEYTON
          Go on!
          Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.

                         YAKITITO
          This means the temperature of the
          emitter is not critical as long as it
          is sufficiently high and as
          long as pure metals with high
          operating temperatures such as
          tungsten or tantalum are used.
          Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm
          now. He blinks.

                         YAKITITO
          Amazing. It work every time.

          The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large
          picture window that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured
          equestrians gallop past in the distance.
          Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a
          bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air
          and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney
          Myron Katz.
          Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving
          coffee.

                         KATZ
          We want to be reasonable here. We
          said we were interested in selling the
          pier frontage and we are interested in
          selling. But frankly Mr. Von
          .will not be robbed.
          Seventy-five strikes us as a fair
          price for this parcel. We're ready to
          conclude a deal here and now at that
          price.

                         PLEASANTLY:

          Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile.
          Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for
          Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful.
          He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie.
          He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods.
          Wine is poured around.

          Sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto
          Julie's shoulder. She sits on the bed going over some papers,
          her expression increasingly disturbed.
          Julie punches a number into the phone.

                         JULIE
          .Dale Gorson, please...
          Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on
          the papers in front of her.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle
          on the topmost memo.
          Julie smiles at him. Then:

                         JULIE
          Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I
          found some memos researching the Von
          Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I
          was supposed to find... From the late
          Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude
          Bellasarious. They're records of
          payments to various people on the
          zoning commission...
          Peyton, behind her, massages her back.

                         JULIE
          .They look like payoffs. Suspicious,
          at the very least... Well, the way I'd
          like to proceed is to talk to Strack's
          son first... Give him the benefit of
          the doubt. Under the circumstances,
          it's the least I can do.
          She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his
          arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises
          and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything
          about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her
          briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she
          turns to Peyton.

          No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been

          across something that puzzled me. It's
          a memo from your office to a Mr.
          Claude Bellasarious--it went out over
          your father's signature. It detailed

          being laid into the palms downtown.
          You're not naive; you know
          it's a cost of doing business.
          Ordinarily you don't have to face it.

          Take a look at that model, Julie.
          That was my father's dream. Now it's
          my dream. Acres of riverfront
          reclaimed from decay, thousands of
          jobs created, a building block--a very
          large building block--laid for the
          future. Not such a bad dream, as
          dreams go. And if the price of
          realizing that dream is the occasional
          distasteful chore, well...

          All right, you're point is well taken.
          But the fact remains that I'm in
          possession of evidence of the
          commission of a crime. You can no
          more ask me to destroy it than I could
          ask you to destroy one of your
          buildings.

                         STRACK
          Let me suggest this. You excuse
          yourself for a few minutes, go to the
          ladies' room, leaving your briefcase
          here. What happens to the memorandum

          toward the limousine but is suddenly hammered by grief.
          Her gait wavers. Racked by sobbing, she falls.
          Tears stream from her eyes as she clutches at the grass.

          106 FADE IN: INT HOSPITAL BURN UNIT- DAY 106

                         BLUE
          The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin
          blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton's lab. A
          form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head
          breaks the surface of the fluid.

                         107 WIDER 107
          A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water
          vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies
          perfectly still, hands and face swathed in gauze; A 20th-
          century mummy. Tubes and wires.poke from his body.
          We hear the steady beeping of a cardiogram.

          108 MASKED BURN NURSES 108
          carefully strap the mummy onto a hydraulically powered,
          multi-axied burn platform. Behind him are other
          bandaged patients, some rotating on burn platforms,
          some still submerged in their hydro-tanks.

          109 THE RESIDENT PHYSICIAN AND FOUR INTERNS
          saunter over to the hydraulic bed where nurses adjust
          the patient's I.V. tubing.

                         RESIDENT
          Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no
          I.D., no medical history. Fished the
          guy out of the river with burns
          covering over forty percent of his
          body. His hands and.face were the
          most severe.

                         110

          110 A BURN NURSE
          pushes a button. Motors grinding, the hydraulic platform
          rotates, slowly spinning the mummified man. For a brief
          moment he is upside down.

                         RESIDENT
          Ten years ago, pain from the burns
          would have been intolerable. The guy
          would have spent the rest of his
          screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz
          technique; quite simply, we sever his
          spino-thalamic nerve...

                         111
          111 ZIIIP! He extends a telescoping steel pointer and to n's bandaged ear.

          .Here. Which, as you know,
          transmits neural-impulses of pain and
          vibratory sense to the brain.

          112,
          112 ZIIIP! He collapses the pointer and returns it to his
          pocket.

                         113

          113 THE HYDRAULIC BURN PLATFORM
          continues its slow rotation with the mummified patient
          now turned sideways.

                         RESIDENT
          No longer receiving impulses of pain,
          you stick him with a pin...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         114
          He jabs a sterilized needle deep into the bandaged knee. 114
          Interns gasp. The resident leaves the pin in the knee
          for dramatic effect.

                         RESIDENT
          .and he can't even feel it.
          With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.

                         115

          PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE

                         115
          His eyes still closed. No response.

                         RESIDENT
          Of course, there are serious emotional
          side effects to this operation. When
          the body ceases to feel, when so much
          sensory input is lost, the patient
          becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
          from its regular diet of input, has a
          never-satisfied thirst; alienation
          gives rise to loneliness, anger;
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
          And the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain--
          giving him the strength of dozen men.
          Hence the leather restraints.
          The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns
          follow behind like ducklings.

          But as it rotates into frame and clangs to a halt.
          Between the bandages, the eyes pop open, blue and
          fiercely lucid. It's Peyton. He has heard everything.

          Durant?

          No. No. I've considered it. but the
          police ruled out arson. It burned
          hot. A gas fire. There was an

          Julie, I was quite impressed with yo
          performance in the von Hoffenstein
          negotiations. Outstanding. I believe
          in instinct. I like yours. I want
          you to think about something. No need
          to decide now. But I'd like staff.
          you as a member of my permanent

          You had no right--

          Don't be childish, I had every right.
          He doesn't want to lose you--said
          he'll fight tooth and nail to keep you
          at the firm. Good! I like a good
          scrap! If it's not worth fighting for
          it's not worth having. Just consider
          that I won't be outbid. Think about

          into his confidence.

                         JULIE
          I'll consider it...
          Strack smiles. As he sweeps her around, her eye catches
          something. Her face tightens.

          around his mouth, revealing: a terrible maw of black
          and crooked teeth, attached to a lipless jawbone. It
          jerks... and words come out:

          contorts his face into a ghastly interpretation of a

          Peyton, I still don't understand. Why
          didn't you come back to see me before
          now?

                         PEYTON
          Well... it's like I told you. The
          burns left some scars and... I was
          ashamed. Afraid. I was afraid that
          you wouldn't want me anymore.

                         JULIE
          Of course I still want you.

                         PEYTON
          But...what if I was...burned. So
          horribly burned, that you couldn't
          stand to look at me. Couldn't stand
          to have me touch you. What then?

                         JULIE
          Well...if that were the case... I
          don't know. But why even ask me that?
          The point is: You're fine. Your
          back. Just like always.
          She smiles. Peyton is filled with the warmth of being
          accepted and wanted once again.

          We hear the garbled chatter of the audio tape being
          rewound.
          We are panning past the Walkman, which is wired to
          the computer. The tape stops, then, as programmed,
          plays again.

          We pan past the back of the Darkman's head. The -
          bandages have been removed. Although his face is not
          visible, the singed hairless back of his skull is.
          It is not a pretty sight.

                         R
          The Darkman swabs a thick white paste, silvidine burn
          ointment, upon his skeletal fingers.

                         DURANT'S VOICE
          That would be just fine for me.
          The Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a
          mask from a black lightproof bag. He examines it,
          returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his
          coat.
          The camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his
          skeletal face.

                         DURANT'S VOICE
          That would be...
          CLICK--the Darkman stops the tape mid-sentence and his
          own hideously charred mandible finishes it:

          came.
          He freezes in the center of a tunnel intersection at the
          sound of FOOTSTEPS. Crunching on gravel; Approaching.
          He fingers the gun's trigger.
          Empty tunnels on all sides.

          Perfect., Handsome. But as for the rest...
          The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of
          scaranf char. Without the benefit of gums or lips, the
          entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root,
          connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains
          intact, the other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary
          cartile forms the nose. But it is the wild eyeballs
          protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that
          tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil
          rage.

          shines upon the wet walls of the tunnels. Nearby they
          find the gun and one of Trumayne's shoes.

          rises quietly into frame. His suit is still clean. He
          appears remarkably unscathed. He runs a hand through his
          hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That's
          when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric
          of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks.
          Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the
          smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff
          and moves off.

          party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his
          arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something

                         ATTENDANT
          Sorry buddy. It don't count if you
          ain't standing behind that line.

                         PEYTON
          I was behind the line.

                         ATTENDANT
          Not hardly.

                         PEYTON
          I was standing right here. Next to my
          girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant,
          .if you please!

                         ATTENDANT
          Na way.
          Julie tugs at his sleeve.

                         JULIE
          Peyton, it doesn't matter.
          Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped
          words, between gasps for breath:

                         PEYTON
          It matters. I won a pink elephant.
          For my girlfriend.

                         JULIE
          Peyton... It's okay...

                         ATTENDANT
          Get lost, buddy.

          People screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round
          horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music gets louder
          and louder.

                         339 PEYTONN
          Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein
          bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:

                         340

                         340

                         PEYTON
          The elephant... Quickly!
          The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's
          chest.
          We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits.
          From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice:

                         ATTENDANT
          You heard me, weirdo. Get lost!

                         341

          341 CRACK!
          The counter dissolves into a million fissures, as do the
          stuffed animals on the shelves above.

                         342

                         342 PEYTON'S FACE
          Twitching violently, vein swollen to bursting. The camera
          races into an eyeball to find:

          Julie screams as well.

                         349
          349 Peyton reaches for the attendant, lifts him into
          the air, hurls him into another pyramid, which
          collapses.

                         351 PEYTON
          shoves it at Julie.
          In a voice hoarse with rage:

                         PEYTON
          Take it!

          Peyton! No!

                         PEYTON
          'Take it!

                         353
          353 His face is starting to send off wisps of smoke.

                          JULIE
          Please!

                          PEYTON

           TAKE THE FUCKING ELEPHANT!!

                          354
          354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror.

                          355
          355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop,
          giving off bursts of smoke.

                          356
          356 Peyton stares at her. Rage ebbs. His eyes become
          haunted. Hoarsely:

                         PEYTON
          Forgive me!
          He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped,
          forgotten, beneath one arm.

                         357
          357 Julie runs after him.

                          JULIE

          359 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALLEY 359

          Darkman rushes down the darkened alley, unlocks the
          warehouse door and rushes inside. CAMERA PANS TO:

          361 INT. WAREHOUSE 361

          There's A HORRIBLE RIPPING NOISE. Darkman is
          destroying something, flailing his arms...

                         362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362
          roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows.

          363 INT. WAREHOUSE 363

          Julie slips through a warehouse window. She is
          confronted by rack upon rack of clothing, shoes, body
          padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe
          room of a major studio.

                         JULIE
          Peyton?!
          364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364
          upon something that makes her gasp.

          365 THE PINK ELEPHANT 365
          ripped to shreds, it's white stuffing all over the
          place.
          366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366

          367 THE DARKMAN'S LAB
           Beams of light cut through the darkness to reveal it;
           The charred holographic imagers, computers, and the
           rebuilt bio-press all sit atop large wooden crates.

                         375 DARKMAN
          turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner
          of his face falls into the light. The handsome,
          undamaged portion.

                         JULIE
          Why didn't you tell me? If you loved
          me, why didn't you tell me?

          377 Tears stream down Julie's face but she is too upset
          to brush them away. She moves forward.

          Do you think it was the face I cared
          about?! Is that how little you think
          of me?! Why didn't you come to me?

                         JULIE
          I would have helped you.
          She stares into the shadows a long time without

          383 INT. EACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Strackâ€ž naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
          wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
          the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
          Mahler symphony plays in the background.
          He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
          rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
          strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
          to the king-sized bed.
          With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
          out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
          They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
          the sides and clatter to the floor.
          Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
          then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
          floor.
          Like a swan he dives.
          He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
          flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
          Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
          slough off, leaving their imprint.
          Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
          himself with the golden coins--
          A knock at the door.
          Strack freezes.

                         STRACK

          as he reaches down for his pants.

          384 INT. STRACK'S LUXURIOUS STUDY- DAY

          Strack enters, tying his tie.

                         STRACK
          Julie, how sweet of you to come before
          our appointed hour... but I expected--
          you in something a little more formal.
          Didn't Ruth inform you that we have
          tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?

                         JULIE
          I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.

                         STRACK
          Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?

                         JULIE
          Thank you, no.

                         STRACK
          I'll have one;_
          As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.

                         STRACK
          ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and
          it's quite good--

                         JULIE
          Louis, I can't see you anymore.

                         STRACK
          Darling, settle down. Don't be rash.
          As you say, let's talk.

                         CONTINUED

                         JULIE
          You know about Peyton, the man I was

                         SEEING--

                         STRACK

                         OF COURSE--

                         JULIE
          Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was
          burned, horribly, horribly burned--I
          don't understand what happened but I
          know he needs my help.
          Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy
          down.

                         STRACK
          .Your news has a bittersweet
          flavor... Of course I'm very happy for
          you. If there's anything I can do--
          the finest medical care can be at your
          disposal--burn therapy, recon-
          structive surgery. How badly was
          he... mutilated?
          Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's
          sofa, her body wracked with sobs.

                         STRACK
          ... Where is he, Julie?

                         JULIE
          He's living in an abandoned warehouse.
          He's alone... he needs me.
          The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks
          it up.

                         STRACK
          Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll
          take it in the other room.
          He looks up at Julie.

          phone.

                         STRACK
          Yes, Franz... And the closing
          price?...

                         JULIE
          She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.

          Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.

                         JULIE
          Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.

                         STRACK (OS)
          I feel sufficiently diversified...
          Franz, it is immaterial to me what the
          market is doing. I want you to buy...

                         JULIE'S POV
          A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the
          briefcase.

                         STRACK'S VOICE
          Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.

                         JULIE
          whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her
          shoulder.

                         STRACK
          .I'm sorry you had to find that,
          dear. Our relationship didn't need
          this further strain.

                         JULIE
          The fire... it wasn't an accident, it
          was you.

                         STRACK
          Not me personally. I have an employee
          who does certain things for me,
          unofficially, off the books. Robert
          doesn't like to pay taxes.

                         JULIE

                         (QUIET)
          And now you'll kill me.
          Strack_ spreads his arms.

                         STRACK
          Hardly. You have nothing on me, my
          dear, and you'd find the extremely
          expensive police department quite
          unsympathetic.
          (A beat).
          Julie. Consider the big picture.

          Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries
          out the door.

                         388
          388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps
          his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then
          he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.

                         STRACK
          Send Robert in.
          Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at
          his rising city. OS the door clicks open.

          ROBERT G. DURANT
          enters the room.

                         I STRACK
          Robert! I have good news and bad.

                         DURANT
          Custom dictates that you render the
          bad news first.

                         STRACK
          You recall the little difficulty with
          my father and how you resolved it. We
          have a similar situation with Miss
          Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has
          uncovered some unflattering
          information about us.

                         DURANT
          No problem at all. And the good news?

                         STRACK
          Your wife died. I'm joking, of
          course. No, the good news is that I
          know who's behind our little troubles
          of late. When you retrieved my
          memorandum, you failed to excise the
          good doctor.

          He's alive. I don't like loose ends,
          Robert. Finish it.

                         DURANT
          Okay. Where is he?

          B446 INT. A CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           RATTLING up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper,

          P446 stars all around us.

                         STRACK
          I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd
          hate to see your kids deprived of a
          role-model.

                         DURANT
          They do look up to me.
          The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The
          lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter
          and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.

                         STRACK
          Kids need an example, Robert. When I
          was a young man my father made me work
          high steel. That's how he started out,
          and in his view what was good enough
          for him was good enough for me...

          Strack gestures broadly with one arm.

                         STRACK
          ...It was just me and the Indians, no
          one else crazy enough to run around up
          here, against the wind, four-fifty an
          hour. Sure I resented it, but now--
          call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it
          sharpens your wits. Life on the edge.
          Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty
          feet down. High steel...
          He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.

                         STRACK
          You don't have any kids, Robert.

                         DURANT
          What are you talking about?

                         STRACK
          Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?

          I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!

                         STRACK
          Then I'm going to make a mistake.
          There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on
          Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.

          Where's the girl?
          Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles
          back over his shoulder.

                         STRACK
          You want to see the girl? Follow me,
          I'll take you to her...
          Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative
          steps.

          Pretty much wiped out the security arm
          of Strack Industries. That's okay.
          I'm a good sport...
          He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following
          cautiously behind.

                         STRACK

          realize those dreams.

          and I are pretty much the same. We
          should be working together. Both smart

          other people's faces now, since yours

          He shrugs.

          447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at
          the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind
          whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically
          to an upright.

                         DURANT/DARKMAN
          Julie!
          Strack laughs.

                         STRACK
          Bring on the strings! Young lovers!
          In peril! Separated by ruthless
          forces, larger than they!--What a
          banal tale. In it, I suppose I play
          the villain. But wait, Julie--which
          of us is the monster here?!
          With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!!
          -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..

                         448
          448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind
          flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps
          against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening
          out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels
          away again. It spins downward towards a forest of
          reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes
          in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--
          pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars.

          gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time,
          overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses
          like csa y..
          Strack"s tone is almost admiring:

          STR.ACK
          You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.

          BLAM!
          Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off
          the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing
          with rage.

                         THE WORLD
          Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--

          I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.

          ON THE UPPER GIRDER
          Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV--
          nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night.
          Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.

                         JULIE
          recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her
          hair.

          With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing
          the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for
          his gun.

                         451

          451 BAM!
          Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his
          hand into the darkness below.

                         OF
          battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet
          sure death on either side of them.

          BAM! BAM! BAM!
          Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto
          the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack
          crawls toward them.

                         DARKMAN
          pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He
          steps back to give a final blow...
          .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.

                         STRACK
          lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.

          ZMMMMMM! Z !

          then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam...

          hot soup of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          454 CRACK!
          Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin
          into Darkman's eyeball to find--

          455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455
          Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the
          camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked.
          456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456
          dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge
          lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a
          shower of gold Krugerands.
          457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457
          head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body.
          Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears
          a funny little hat.
          458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458
          the face of the Darkman.
          459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459
          bursts into flames.
          460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460
          pulsing madly.

           insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated
           on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating
           sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand
           is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.

          flail impotently.

          Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.
          463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463
          to fall, yards away from the girder.
          464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464

          her.

          I don't care how you look, Peyton! I.
          love you. The burns don't matter.
          There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted
          remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
          close-up.
          CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

          overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

                         DARKMAN
          It disgusts you.

                         JULIE
          No.
          Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

                         FINALLY:

                         DARKMAN
          This hand... it used to caress you.
          Now it can only tear, rip away at
          things.

                         DARKMAN

                         (BEAT)
          I can live with it now, but I don't
          think anyone else can.

                         JULIE
          (tears in her

                         EYES)
          I want it back. The two of us--the way
          it was...
          Darkman's voice breaks:

                         DARKMAN
          What we had--our life together--it
          belonged in the light of day.
          He disappears into the darkness.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:

                         DARKMAN
          Peyton is gone...
          466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466
          he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a
          construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other
          side.
          Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he
          slips into the pedestrian traffic.
          The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she
          desperately searches for him, turning people around,
          staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
          alien faces in search of the man she loves.

          AS WE ROLL END CREDITS
          The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,
          any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull
          back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
          wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
          person shuffles into view:

          467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467
          snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs
          the street person and spins him around, revealing--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          172.

          THE CHARRED SKULL OF DARKMAN
          Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets.
          Mandibles yank back and, through a lipless smile, he

                         RASPS:

                         DARKMAN

          RUN FOR YOUR LIFE::
