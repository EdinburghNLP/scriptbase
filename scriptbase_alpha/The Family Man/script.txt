          CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

     1     INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

          SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

          A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
          London.

          JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
          Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
          eyes... sitting next to...

          KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
          rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

                         KATE
               I got you a few necessities...

          Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegut’s “Cat’s 
          Cradle.”

                         KATE  (CONT’D)
               Your copy was a mess...

          Jack accepts the book but he’s unable to take his eyes 
          off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Every one of these songs will 
               remind you of me in a slightly 
               different way...

                         JACK
               All in one tape?

                         KATE
               I also put side two of London 
               Calling on there...

          Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
          lips.

                         KATE  (CONT’D)
               That was not officially the 
               goodbye kiss. It was just an 
               interim kiss...

          He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
          close, kissing her deeply. Then...

                         ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
               This will be the final boarding 
               call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
               London, Heathrow.

          Jack takes Kate’s hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
          the gate.

                         KATE
               You have your ticket?

          Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
          nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

                         JACK
               I’m not even gonna say it, 
               Kate. Maybe it’ll be like 
               I never left...

          Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
          gate.

          Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

          ...a  moment of intuition. Something isn’t right. She 
          looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
          trying to decide...

                         KATE
               Wait.

          Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I have a bad feeling about 
               this.

                         JACK
               About the plane? What do you 
               think it’s gonna crash? Don’t 
               say that...

                         KATE
                    (shaking her head)
               I know we’ve talked about this a 
               thousand times and we both agree 
               that going to London is the 
               right thing to do. But in my 
               heart... this feels wrong.

          She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
          then back into Jack’s eyes.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Don’t  go, Jack...

                         JACK
               You mean don’t go at all?  
               What about my internship?

                         KATE
               Believe me I know what an 
               incredible opportunity this 
               is for you...

                         JACK
               For us, Kate.

                         KATE
               Right, for us. But...I’m
               afraid that if you get on 
               that plane...

                         JACK
               What?

          Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she can’t 
          say...

                         KATE
                    (torn)
               Go. I’m sorry, you should just 
               go...

                         JACK
                    (thinking, then...)
               No, you’re right.  What are we 
               doing?

                         KATE
               We're being responsible.  Go.
               Get on the plane.

          His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

                         KATE (CONT'D)
                    (a smile)
               Get the hell outta my sight.
               You bother me.

          A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
          nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
          Jack.

                         JACK
                    (resolute)
               Okay, I'm going...

          He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
          tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
          disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

                         KATE
               I can't seem to let go of
               you...

                         JACK
               You hear me complaining about
               that?

          A sober look in Jack's eyes.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Look, we're at the airport and
               no one ever thinks clearly at
               the airport so we should just
               trust the decision we already
               made.  You've been accepted to
               one of the best law schools in
               the country, I've got this
               internship at Barclay's Bank.
               We have a great plan, honey...

          Kate nods, then, with resolve...

                         KATE
               You want to do something
               great, Jack?  Let's flush the
               plan...start our lives right
               now, today...I don't know what
               that life's gonna look like
               but I do know it has both of
               us in it.  And I choose us...

          Jack is jolted by her words.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               The plan doesn't make us
               great, Jack.  What we have
               together, that's what makes us
               great.

          Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
          looks toward the gate, only one person left in
          line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

          Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

                         JACK
               I love you, Kate...

          ...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (taking her face in
                     his hands)
               ...and a year in London's not
               gonna change that.  A hundred
               years couldn't change that...

          Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
          the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
          look back.

          Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
          the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
          willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
          doesn't...

          DISSOLVE TO:

    1A     EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
          Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
          Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

     2     EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

          We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
          building...

     3     INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
          moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
          behind it...

          The place looks like a museum display...everything is
          of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

          A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
          Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

          And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

     4     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

          Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
          mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
          A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
          shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
          where he sees...

          A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
          back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
          curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
          turns to him...

          PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
          mouth...

                         PAULA
                    (holding up toothbrush)
                  I hope you don't mind.  There
                  were like ten new ones in the
                  cabinet.

          A playful smile from Paula.

                         JACK
                  It's not what you think.  I
                  took Mentadent public...

          Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
          black dress hanging neatly over it.

                         PAULA
                  Did you really mean what you
                  said about Tuscany?

                         JACK
                  Of course I did.

                         PAULA
                  Last night was great...

                         JACK
                  You are an amazing lover.  You
                  should be giving motivational
                  seminars.

                         PAULA
                  Thanks.  You're not bad
                  yourself...

          Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
          stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
          slips the dress on.

                         JACK
                  I want to see you again.

                         PAULA
                  I'd like that, too.

               JACK
                  Tonight.

          She turns to him.

                         PAULA
                  It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

                         JACK
                  So we'll get egg nog.

          Paula laughs.

                         PAULA
                    (putting on her shoes)
                  I have to go to my parents'
                  house out in Jersey.  Would
                  you like to come?

                         JACK
                  Jersey?  You know what the
                  traffic's gonna be like?

                         PAULA
                  I'm taking the train...

          Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
          dangling on his chest.

                         PAULA (CONT'D)
                  Don't you have anywhere to go?

                         JACK
                  I've got plenty of places to
                  go.

          He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
          answer...

                         PAULA
                    (a sexy laugh, then...)
                  Maybe I can try and sneak away
                  some time tomorrow morning...
                    (kissing him on 
                     the lips)
                  Okay?

                         JACK
                    (coy)
                  If it's something you feel
                  strongly about.
 
          Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

                         PAULA
               It was nice meeting you, Jack...

          CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A     INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
          living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

          ...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
          hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
          enveloped in music...

    4B     INT. JACK’S BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

          Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
          emanating from Jack’s apartment...an intrigued glance 
          back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

     5     INT. JACK’S BATHROOM - MORNING

          Back’s “Passion According to St. Matthew” is blaring 
          through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
          orchestra...

          Jack’s at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
          tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
          Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

     6     INT. JACK’S CLOSET - MORNING

          ...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
          suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
          shirts everywhere.

          Jack’s still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
          front of a mirror.

     7     INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

          Jack, wearing an elegant camel’s hair overcoat and 
          carrying a leather briefcase, a “Master of the 
          Universe” smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
          from memory...

          The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
          singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
          coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

                         JACK
                    (a charming smile)
                  Mrs. Peterson.

                         MRS. PETERSON
                  Hello Jack.  You don’t 
                  have to stop singing on 
                  my account...

                         JACK
                  It’s because I’m shy, 
                  Betty.  So, when are you 
                  going to leave that old 
                  corpse Mr. Peterson and 
                  run away with me?

                         MRS. PETERSON
                  You know you could never 
                  satisfy me the way he 
                  does...

          The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
          ahead.

     8     INT. JACK’S BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

          TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
          Peterson...

                         TONY THE DOORMAN
                  Merry Christmas, Mr. 
                  Campbell.

                         JACK
                  How’d you do this year, 
                  Tony?

                         TONY THE DOORMAN
                  About four grand.  And a 
                  bottle of twenty five 
                  year old scotch from Mrs. 
                  Johnson in 9D.  I’m 
                  putting it all in 
                  commercial paper like you 
                  said.

                         JACK
                  Just until the Deutsche 
                  Mark turns...

          Jack exits the building...

     9   OMITTED

    9A     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

          Jack’s Ferrari racing through the park...

    10     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

          A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
          glass doors reads, “P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
          Investment House.”

          The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
          into the building...

    10A     INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          ...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
          smile on his way to the elevators...

          CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

          DISSOLVE TO:

    11     INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
          this beautiful conference room.

          SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
          with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
          table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
          look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
          of him.

          Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
          small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
          the table.

          Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
          room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
          screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

                         JACK
                  ...if MedTech's shares sink
                  any lower than...
                    (casually executing 
                     a keystroke)
                  ...forty three, we're in
                  trouble with the stock
                  valuation.  So for god's sake
                  watch what you say to your
                  institutional customers...

          Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  ...we still have almost a full
                  day of trading before zero
                  hour and I don't want any
                  trouble...
                    (distracted by Mintz)
                  ...penny for your thoughts,
                  Alan...

          Alan looks up.

                         ALAN
                  Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
                  the kids I'd be home by
                  dinner.  You know, it being
                  Christmas Eve and all.

                         JACK
                  Is that tonight?

          A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  You think I like being here on
                  Christmas Eve, Alan?

                         ALAN
                  I don't know.  Maybe...

          Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
          chuckle.

                         JACK
                  Okay, maybe I do have a touch
                  of tunnel vision this holiday
                  season.  But in two days we're
                  going to announce one of the
                  largest mergers in U.S.
                  corporate history.  Thirty
                  billion dollars...
                    (basking in the glory)
                  When this kind of deal turns
                  up you get on and you ride it
                  `till it's over.  You don't
                  ask it for a vacation...

          A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
          energize Jack.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (to the group)
                  December 26th.  After that
                  there'll be so much money
                  floating around here it'll be
                  like Christmas every day...
                    (smiling)
                  December 26th, people.  If
                  you'd like to celebrate that
                  day, you all have my
                  blessing...

          Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
          around the table...

                         ALAN
                  You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
                  Jack approaches Alan.

                         JACK
                  I don't want you to be sorry,
                  Alan, I want you to be
                  excited.  I want my gift to be
                  the first one you open this
                  year.  You know why?

                         ALAN
                  Why Jack?

                         JACK
                  Because my gift comes with ten
                  zeroes at the end...

          A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
          smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  Good man...

    12     INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
          SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
          messages.

          Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
          ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
          messages.

                         ADELLE
                  Only eight thirty?  What's the
                  matter, had some last minute
                  shopping to do?

          Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
          hands him his messages.

                         JACK
                  You too?  This holiday's about
                  giving, Adelle.  And I'm
                  giving everything I've got to
                  this deal, so in a way, I'm
                  more Christmassy than
                  anyone...
                    (holding out the candy)
                  Lifesaver?

                         ADELLE
                    (ignoring the candy)
                  You're a ray of sunshine,
                  Jack.

          They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
          President" stenciled on the glass...

    13     INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          ...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
          messages, and into Jack's office...

    14     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
          high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
          Stairmaster...

          Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
          down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

                         ADELLE
                  Oh, and Oxxford called...

                         JACK
                  Ooh, my suits are ready...

          He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
          reels back.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  Kate Reynolds...

                         ADELLE
                  Her assistant said you could
                  call her at home after eight.

          Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
          ghost.

                         JACK
                  Her assistant?

                         ADELLE
                  Yeah Jack, her assistant...

                         JACK
                    (lost in the message)
                  Kate Reynolds was my
                  girlfriend in college.  I
                  almost married her...

                         ADELLE
                    (a hearty LAUGH)
                  You?  Married?

                         JACK
                    (snapping out of it)
                  Almost married.  And almost a
                  junior broker at E.F.
                  Hutton...

                         ADELLE
                  Excuse me?

                         JACK
                  She didn't want me to go to
                  London.  We're standing at the
                  airport saying goodbye and she
                  asks me to stay.

                         ADELLE
                  So you left her?  Just like
                  that?

                         JACK
                  God, no.  I thought about it
                  for practically the entire
                  flight...

                         ADELLE
                  Stop Jack, I'm getting all
                  weepy.

                         JACK
                  I took the road less traveled,
                  Adelle.

                         ADELLE
                  And look where it's led you...
                    (picking up the phone)
                  I'm gonna get her on the
                  phone...

          Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
          back...

          Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
          reaches out and hangs up the phone.

                         JACK
                  No...

                         ADELLE
                  No?!  You almost married this
                  woman.  Aren't you even
                  curious what she wants?

                         JACK
                  She's probably just having a
                  fit of nostalgia.  You know,
                  lonely Christmas Eve, call the
                  one that got away, that kind
                  of thing.

          Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  I'm telling you, it's ancient
                  history...

          Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
          chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
          the room.

                         LASSITER
                  Eight forty-five on Christmas
                  Eve and Jack Campbell is still
                  at his desk.  There's a
                  Hallmark moment for you...

          Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
          times.

                         JACK
                  Peter.  I don't see you
                  rushing home to trim the tree.

                         LASSITER
                    (pouring himself 
                     a scotch)
                  That's because I'm a heartless
                  bastard who only cares about
                  money.

                         JACK
                  And God love you for it.

          Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
          Jack.

                         LASSITER
                    (sipping the scotch)
                  I just got a call from Terry
                  Haight.  Bob Thomas is
                  nervous...

                         JACK
                  That'll happen when you're
                  about to spend thirty billion
                  dollars on some aspirin...

                         LASSITER
                  Someone's gonna have to nurse
                  him through this.

                         JACK
                  Why are you staring at my
                  breasts, Peter?

                         LASSITER
                  I need you, tiger..

                         JACK
                  Where is he?

                         LASSITER
                  Aspen.

          Jack pauses for a beat.

                         JACK
                    (to Adelle)
                  Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
                  won't be able to make it
                  tomorrow...

          Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

                         LASSITER
                  You're a credit to capitalism,
                  Jack.

          Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

                         JACK
                  Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
                  question.  An old girlfriend
                  calls you out of the blue on
                  Christmas Eve...

                         LASSITER
                  You suddenly having trouble
                  getting dates?

                         JACK
                  Not by a long shot.

                         LASSITER
                  Then leave it in the past.
                  Old flames are like old tax
                  returns.  You keep `em in the
                  file cabinet for three years
                  and then you cut `em loose.

          Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
          Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
          Knicks hoop.

                         JACK
                    (to Adelle)
                  I'll leave from the office
                  tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
                  group.  Schedule an emergency
                  strategy session for noon.

                         ADELLE
                  That'll be a nice little
                  holiday treat.

    15     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

          A single light remains on in the building.

    16     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

          Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
          checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

          Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
          checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
          to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
          glory, then he see it...

          ...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
          trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
          the night...

    17     INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
          desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
          monitors.

                         FRANK
                  Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
                  call down, I would've had Joe
                  get your ride.

          Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
          street.

                         JACK
                  I'm thinking I might walk
                  tonight, Frank.

                         FRANK
                  Nice night for it.  I'll have
                  Louis send your car home.

          A nod from Jack.

                         FRANK (CONT'D)
                  Merry Christmas to you, sir...

                         JACK
                  Thanks.  To you too...

          Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
          out into the crisp night air...

    18     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

          Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
          large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19     EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
          falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
          the windows of the closed shops along the way.

          He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
          Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

          He heads toward it...

    20     INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
          Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

          SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
          behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
          salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
          liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

          ...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
          "CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
          coffee machine...

                         CASH
                  Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
                  a certified winner...paper-
                  thin but good as gold...

          Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

          Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

                         JACK
                  Egg nog?

                         SAM WONG
                    (pointing)
                  Dairy case.  Five dollar.

                         CASH
                    (in the b.g., to 
                     Sam Wong)
                  Y'all do the lotto here...?
                  `Cause I got me a winner...I
                  know, I know, Lotto keeps the
                  black man down... but not
                  me...

          Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
          handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
          the counter...

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  ...06...14...18...48...right
                  there.  Four numbers...that's
                  two hundred and thirty eight
                  dollar...
                    (a smile)
                  Merry Christmas and shit...

                         SAM WONG
                    (barely looking 
                     at ticket)
                  Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
                  with pencil.

                         CASH
                  What're you talkin' about?

                         SAM WONG
                    (throwing the ticket 
                     back)
                  You draw lines with pencil!  I
                  know about this!

          The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
          looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
          bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
          instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
          back...

                         CASH
                  What!?  Look at the ticket...!

                         SAM WONG
                  Get out, I call 911.

          The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

                         CASH
                  You're lookin' at me, you're
                  not even lookin' at the
                  ticket!

          The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
          the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

                         SAM WONG
                  You leave now.  Take ticket
                  somewhere else.
                    (calling out)
                  Next customer in line...!

                         CASH
                  You first generation,
                  xenophobic, money-theistic,
                  hot pastrami sandwich
                  making...

                         SAM WONG
                    (screaming)
                  Get out!

          Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
          face...

                         CASH
                  LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

          A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

                         JACK
                    (carefully)
                  Let me see that ticket.

          Cash turns to Jack.

                         CASH
                    (menacing)
                  Was I talkin' to you?!

          Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
          then...

                         JACK
                  Maybe I'll buy it from you.

          Now Cash walks over to Jack...

                         CASH
                  Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
                  kicked tryin' to be a hero.
                  Film at eleven...
                    (then...turning to 
                     the coffee machine)
                  What?!  Oh no, not another
                  lookie-loo.  You know how big
                  a job this is?

          The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
          confused.

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  You're double bookin' me!
                  You're gonna get double
                  billed!  Shit!

          Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
          SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
          baby...

                         JACK
                  Hey, c'mon...

          In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
          pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
          covers her baby.

                         CASH
                    (in Jack's face)
                  Do you want to die?

          Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
          cool...

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

                         JACK
                  No.
 
                         CASH
                    (a smile)
                  Yes you do...

                         JACK
                  Look, I'm talking about a
                  business deal here.  I buy the
                  ticket for two hundred, take
                  it to a store where the guy
                  behind the counter...
                    (glaring at Sam Wong)
                  ...doesn't have a death wish
                    (back to Cash)
                  ...I just made myself a quick
                  thirty eight dollars.

          Cash gets closer...

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  Like I said, it's a business
                  deal...

                         CASH
                  Damn, you are the real
                  thing...

          Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
          gun back into his pants...

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
                  here...
                    (to Sam Wong)
                  You were lookin' at me, papa,
                  you shoulda been lookin' at
                  the ticket.  That ticket was
                  legit, B.  You're fake...

          Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21     EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
          his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
          hundred dollars...

                         JACK
                  How'd you know my name was
                  Jack?

                         CASH
                  I call all you white guys
                  "Jack."

          Jack nods...

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  You know you seem pretty
                  relaxed for a guy who just had
                  a gun pulled on him.

                         JACK
                  There's no way I was gonna die
                  in that deli...
                    (off Cash's look)
                  Let's just say I've been on a
                  lucky streak lately.

                         CASH
                    (a big LAUGH)
                  A lucky streak, huh?

          Jack hands him the money.

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  Sound pretty sure of yourself,
                  don't you?

          Jack nods.

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  So you're telling me, you've
                  got a gun to your head and you
                  don't think for one second,
                  what if this, what if that,
                  maybe I shouldn't do this, I
                  shoulda done that.

                         JACK
                  I don't do that.  That's just
                  not for me...

          Cash looks at him, then smiles.

                         CASH
                  Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
                  business with you...
                  Cash is about to take off...

                         JACK
                  Hey...

          Cash turns around.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                  What do you want to carry that
                  gun around for, anyway?
                  You're just gonna do something
                  you'll regret...

                         CASH
                  You want to talk about
                  regrets, you're talking to the
                  wrong person.

          Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
          the carton...

                         JACK
                  I'm just saying that you seem
                  like a smart guy.  At a
                  certain point you're gonna do
                  something, and then there's no
                  turning back...

                         CASH
                  Yeah, in most cases that'd be
                  true.

          Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

                         JACK
                  I mean there must be programs
                  out there, opportunities...

                         CASH
                    (a deep laugh)
                  Wait a minute, wait a
                  minute... you're tryin' to
                  save me?

          A look from Jack...

                         CASH (CONT'D)
                  Oh man, you're serious...
                    (out to the street)
                  This man thinks I need to be
                  saved!

                         JACK
                  Everyone needs something.

          Cash looks at Jack...

                         CASH
                  Yeah?  What do you need?

                         JACK
                  Me?

                         CASH
                  You just said everyone needs
                  something.

                         JACK
                  I've got everything I need.

                         CASH
                  Wow.  It must be great being
                  you.  You got it all.

          Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

                         JACK
                  Look, I'm not saying you'd be
                  able to do it without some
                  hard work...

                         CASH
                    (a hearty LAUGH)
                  You still think this is about
                  me, don't you?

                         JACK
                  Sure it's about you.  But it's
                  about society, too.

                         CASH
                  Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
                  one... Just remember, Jack,
                  you did this.  You brought
                  this on yourself...

          And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
          street with his egg nog...

    22     INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
          off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
          heads into the bedroom.

          Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

          CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

          DISSOLVE TO:

    24     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

          Close in on Jack’s face, bathed in morning light...he 
          opens his eyes...feels something strange...

          Jack looks down...there’s a woman’s head resting on his 
          chest.

          A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
          remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

          He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
          faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

          ...did she have a dog?

          He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
          get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

          ...KATE REYNOLDS...

          ...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
          contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

          His head darts around the room - it’s cramped and lived 
          in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
          the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
          and a charming little bay window.

          He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
          on the night stand, but it’s not there.  It’s a Timex 
          Indiglo and it reads, “7:57 A.M...”

          Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe it’s 
          a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

                         KATE
                  Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
                  Jack... it’s Christmas...

          Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

          Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
          ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
          carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
          of her lungs...

                         ANNIE
                  Jingle bells, Santa s
                  mells, Rudolph laid an 
                  egg...la la la, la-la la 
                  la, la la la la la...

          Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
          herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

                         ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  You too, Luce...

          The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
          everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
          starts jumping.

                         ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  Rise...and...shine...!

                         KATE
                    (stirring)
                  You’re jumping, 
                  sweetheart...

          Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
          funeral.

                         ANNIE
                  Mom, don’t you think we 
                  need to open the 
                  presents?

                         KATE
                    (groggy)
                  Mommy needs five more 
                  minutes in la la land.  
                  That could be her 
                  present...

          Josh crawls directly up to Jack’s stomach, climbing 
          on.

                         ANNIE
                  C’mon, Dad.  Get up!

          She said “Dad.”

          That’s it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
          gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
          next to it.

          He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
          bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

          Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
          for the first time...he’s naked...

          ...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
          the bed...

          ...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
          cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

          Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

                         KATE
                  Jack...?

          Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
          near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
          eyes...

          Eye contact...Jack’s certain he’s about to hear her 
          scream...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (still groggy)
                  Strong coffee, okay?

          She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

          A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
          of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
          gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
          fireplace.

          Jack darts to the top of the steps...

                         KATE (O.S.)
                    (calling from 
                     the bedroom)
                  Use an entire can if you 
                  have to!

          He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
          stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
          in shock.

          He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
          door...about to step out when he looks down and 
          realizes...

          ...he’s barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
          boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
          leave when...

          He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
          lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
          do...

          The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
          wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
          60s), Kate’s parents.  Big Ed’s wearing a ten gallon 
          hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
          dangling from her mouth.

                         JACK
                    (drawing on a 
                     memory)
                  Ed?  Lorraine?

          Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
          gifts.

                         BIG ED
                  Jack you ol’ bird dog.  
                  Merry Christmas to ya’...

          Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jack’s cheek.

                         LORRAINE
                  Talk to him, Jack.  
                  Please.  One day a year 
                  away from the Ponderosa.  
                  I don’t think that’s too 
                  much to ask.

                         BIG ED
                  I heard that.  This is 
                  who I am, woman!
                    (a wink to Jack)
                  Tell her, Jack!  You’re 
                  the only one who gets me, 
                  for god’s sake!

          Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

                         LORRAINE
                  I need some egg nog...

                         BIG ED
                  ‘Course you do.  Hell, 
                  it’s almost 8 a.m.  
                    (shouting upstairs)
                  Where are my two l’il 
                  pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
                  Giddy up, Bid Ed’s here!

                         JACK
                  Excuse me.

          Jack dashes out the door.

                         LORRAINE
                  Where are you going, 
                  Jack?
                    (to Big Ed)
                  Where’s he going?

                         BIG ED
                  Damned if I know...

          They start to remove their coats, when...

          The door flies back open...

                         JACK
                  Where’s my car?!  Where’s 
                  my Ferrari!?

                         BIG ED
                  What the hell are you 
                  talking about?
                    (to Lorraine)
                  What’s he talking about?

                         JACK
                  Look, can I just borrow 
                  your car?!  I promise 
                  it’ll be returned!

                         BIG ED
                  The Caddy?  Why don’t you 
                  take your own damn car!

                         LORRAINE
                  Oh just let him borrow 
                  your precious Cadillac, 
                  for god’s sake.

          Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

                         BIG ED
                  He’s got a perfectly good 
                  mini-van sitting out 
                  there in the driveway!

          Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26     EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
          house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
          in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

          He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
          driveway, a “My Ferrari Is In The Shop” sticker on the 
          rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
          of the driveway...

    27     INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

          Jack sees a sign, “George Washington Bridge - 3 miles”...

    28     INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

          Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
          passes under a sign for “Manhattan.”

    29     EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

          The mini-van pulls up near Jack’s apartment building.  
          Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
          running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
          sternly in front.

                         JACK
                  Tony, thank god...

          Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

                         TONY THE DOORMAN
                  Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
                  for residents and guests 
                  only...

                         JACK
                  What are you talking 
                  about?  It’s me, Jack 
                  Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
                  I put you into commercial 
                  paper!

                         TONY THE DOORMAN
                    (not moving)
                  Uh-huh...

          Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
          her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

                         JACK
                  Elizabeth Peterson!

          The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

                         MRS. PETERSON
                    (to Tony re: 
                     Jack, annoyed)
                  Who is this man?

          Tony shrugs his shoulders.

                         JACK
                  You know me, Betty.  You 
                  do.  Jack Campbell.  
                  We’re on the co-op board 
                  together.  We fought side 
                  by side for garbage 
                  disposals.  Every morning 
                  we exchange quasi-sexual 
                  witty banter.  Think...

          She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
          YAPPING.

                         TONY THE DOORMAN
                    (to Mrs. Peterson)
                  Should I call the cops?  
                  I’m gonna call the 
                  cops...

          Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

                         MRS. PETERSON
                    (raising a hand 
                     to Tony)
                  No...

                         JACK
                    (a sigh of relief)
                  Thank you, Betty.  I know 
                  if I can just sleep this 
                  off, I’ll be fine...

                         MRS. PETERSON               
                  And sleep you shall.  
                  Noblesse oblige is not 
                  dead.  Not yet 
                  anyway...Come, let’s get 
                  you some help.  Surely 
                  there must be a shelter 
                  somewhere in this city.

                         JACK
                  A shelter?!  I’m the 
                  richest guy in the 
                  building...I’ve got twice 
                  the square footage you 
                  have!

          Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
          her face.

          Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

          CUT TO:

    30     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

          Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
          van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
          building entrance...

    31     INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

          Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
          desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

          Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

                         FRANK
                  Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
                  it right there...

                         JACK
                  Frank.  Where’s Alan 
                  Mintz?  Is he here yet?

                         FRANK
                  Mr. Mintz?
                    (a knowing chuckle)
                  I don’t think 
                  so...building’s closed 
                  pal.  You’ll have to come 
                  back tomorrow.

                         JACK
                  Look, I don’t know what’s 
                  going on here but I am 
                  Senior Vice President of 
                  this company.

                         FRANK
                  I don’t care who you 
                  are.  It’s Christmas and 
                  like I told you the 
                  building is closed.

                         JACK
                  Maybe you’re not hearing 
                  me.  I am Jack 
                  Campbell...
                    (approaching the 
                     building directory)
                  Right here.  Jack 
                  Campbell, President...

          And then he sees it...”ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT,” listed 
          plain as day on the building director...

          Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
          directory...

          A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
          shock...

          CHAPTER FIVE - WHAT’S HAPPENING?

    32     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

          ...it’s desolate...

          Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
          registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
          toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

          SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jack’s 
          torso...a VOICE from the car...

                         VOICE (O.S.)
                  Hey!  Watch where you’re 
                  walking!

          Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...can’t 
          quite make out the face...

                         VOICE 
                  You almost dented my two 
                  hundred thousand dollar 
                  car!

          Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
          familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

                         VOICE (CONT’D)
                  That’s right!  My new 
                  car’s worth more than 
                  your shitty house!

          A look of realization on Jack’s face...

                         VOICE (CONT’D)
                  I feel like I really did 
                  win the lottery!

          ...it’s Cash, and he’s in Jack’s car...

          Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
          smile from Cash...

                         CASH
                  Miss me, Jack?

                         JACK
                  That’s my car!  You stole 
                  my car!

                         CASH
                  It’s a callable asset 
                  seized in accordance with 
                  the acquisition by-laws 
                  of your alt-fate 
                  contract...

                         JACK
                  What?!

                         CASH
                  Basically, it’s my car 
                  now.  Get in.

          Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
          hesitates...

                         CASH (CONT’D)
                  Look, I don’t make the 
                  rules, Jack.  This is how 
                  it works.  Get in.

          Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33     INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

          Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
          burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
          back seat...

                         CASH
                  Might wanna fasten your 
                  seat belt, Jack...

                         JACK
                    (recovering)
                  What the hell is 
                  happening to me?!

          Jack’s freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
          of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
          breathing into the bag.

                         CASH
                  This kinda thing makes a 
                  lotta guys throw up.  
                  Seen it happen.  So if 
                  you get the urge, do it 
                  out the window.
                    (with a taunting 
                     laugh)
                  I don’t want you marring 
                  this exquisite leather 
                  interior...

          Cash looks over at Jack...he’s really losing it, 
          sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
          smiles...

                         CASH (CONT’D)
                  Look, I don’t know what 
                  you’re getting so worked 
                  up about, you did 
                  this...you brought this 
                  on yourself.

                         JACK
                  Brought what on myself?!  
                  I didn’t do anything!

                         CASH
                  No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve 
                  got everything I need, I 
                  don’t have regrets, 
                  that’s just not for me... 
                  sound familiar?

                         JACK
                  You mean because you 
                  thought I was cocky I’m 
                  now on a permanent acid 
                  trip?!!

          Cash gets a laugh out of Jack’s overreaction...

                         CASH
                  Everyone else in that 
                  store is a statue, they 
                  see their lives passing 
                  in front of their eyes, 
                  but not you.  You’re 
                  making a business deal...

                         JACK
                    (enraged)
                  Give me my goddamn life 
                  back!

                         CASH
                  You?  What about me?  I’m 
                  working hard for you 
                  here, Jack.  On Christmas 
                  too!  Now you did a good 
                  thing last night, 
                  intervening that way.  I 
                  was moved...

                         JACK
                    (interrupting)
                  Please.  Just tell me 
                  what’s happening to me.  
                  In plain English.  None 
                  of that mumbo jumbo...

          Cash turns to Jack.

                         CASH
                  It’s a glimpse, Jacko.

                         JACK
                  I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
                  what!?  What glimpse?!  
                  Glimpse!

                         CASH
                  Look, eventually, 
                  everybody gets one...some 
                  of ‘em take a couple 
                  seconds...
                    (looking at Jack)
                  ...some of ‘em take a lot 
                  longer...

                         JACK
                  I asked you a direct 
                  question!  A glimpse of 
                  what?!

          A look from Cash.

                         CASH
                  Figure it out.  You got 
                  plenty of time.

                         JACK
                  How much time?!

                         CASH
                  As long as it takes to 
                  figure it out.  Which, in 
                  your case, could be 
                  considerable.

                         JACK
                  Look, I just want my life 
                  back.  Now what’s it 
                  gonna take?  You wanna 
                  talk turkey?  Let’s talk 
                  turkey!  How much 
                  money...?

          Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
          Jack a smile.

                         CASH
                  Do I look like I need 
                  your money.  It doesn’t 
                  work like that and I 
                  can’t tell you why.

                         JACK
                  Why not?

                         CASH
                  Because you got to figure 
                  it out for yourself.
                    (beat)
                  Are you listening to me?

                         JACK
                  Figure it out?  Figure 
                  what out?!

          Cash just stares at him...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  That’s it?  That’s all I 
                  get?!  A glare?!

                         CASH
                  Look Jack, in my 
                  experience the best way 
                  people deal with this is 
                  to just relax and breathe 
                  through it...let it come 
                  to you.

          Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

                         JACK
                  Look, I don’t have time 
                  for this right now.  I’m 
                  in the middle of a 
                  deal...
                         CASH
                  Oh you’re working on a 
                  new deal now...did I
                  mention that?

                         JACK
                  You know what?  I’ve had 
                  it with you.  I’ve had it 
                  with all of this shit...

          SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
          sending Jack through the windshield.

          Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
          to the mini-van.

          Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
          Jack...

                         CASH
                  Here...

          Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
          BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

                         JACK
                  What’s this, a signal?  
                  Will you come whenever I 
                  ring it?

                         CASH
                  Do I look like I live in 
                  a bottle?

          Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

                         JACK
                    (lost)
                  But what do I do?

                         CASH
                  Look Jack I’m late.  I’d 
                  love to help you out some 
                  more but I gotta go 
                  handle my business...
                    (gesturing to 
                     the mini-van)
                  Happy trails.

          Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
          to Cash.

                         JACK
                  Hey, you did this to me, 
                  you can’t just leave me 
                  like this.

          Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

                         CASH
                  Fine.  You want to know 
                  everything, I’ll tell you 
                  everything.  But not 
                  here.  Let’s get some 
                  air...

          Jack’s still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
          driver side door...

                         JACK
                    (relieved)
                  Thanks, man...

          Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
          around, Cash’s door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
          a blast of horsepower...

          Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
          the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
          disappearing...

          The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
          Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
          and finally to the mini-van.

    34     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

          The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
          the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
          Christmas.

    35     INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

          Jack’s trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
          steering wheel and the car’s registration in his 
          hand...

          He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
          science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
          late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
          fruit in hand...

          Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
          window.

                         JACK
                  Excuse me.  Do you know 
                  where Merrison Street is?

          Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

                         ARNIE
                    (turning to his wife)
                  Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36     INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
          decorated suburban home, Arnie’s arm around his 
          shoulder.

                         ARNIE
                  You look terrible...

          Jack takes in the decor – it’s a male leisure time 
          fantasy – old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
          board, and kitschy ‘50s style bamboo bar...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  Truth is I expected you.  
                  Kate called before and 
                  asked if I knew where you 
                  were.

          Arnie notices Jack’s fascination with the room...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  I know, I moved the 
                  Barca-lounger into the 
                  corner.  It’s throwin’ 
                  everybody off.  What do 
                  you think?

                         JACK
                    (with a nod)
                  Great room...

          A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jack’s approval means 
          something to him.

                         ARNIE
                  You and me, buddy.  We 
                  know how to live...

          Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
          out of a bamboo bottle holder.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  So Jack, you okay?

          Jack doesn’t respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
          photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
          with the caption, “Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
          Champs, 1994.”

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  I mean you leave the 
                  house on Christmas 
                  morning, you don’t tell 
                  anyone where you’re 
                  going...

          Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

                         JACK
                  We’re friends, aren’t we?

                         ARNIE
                  Maybe I don’t say it 
                  enough but you moving in 
                  next door to me...

          Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
          nods.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  Talk to me...

          A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
          open eyed, ready to listen.

                         JACK
                  I’m having kind of a bad 
                  day.

                         ARNIE
                    (nodding)
                  I read somewhere that the 
                  suicide rate doubles 
                  during the holidays...

          A raised eyebrow from Jack.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                    (to himself)
                  What am I saying?  You 
                  don’t need to hear 
                  that...
                    (back to Jack)
                  All I meant was a lot of 
                  people have a hard time 
                  dealing with all the 
                  forced reverie, that’s 
                  all.  Is that you?

                         JACK
                  Is it...?

                         ARNIE
                  Trouble at work?

                         JACK
                  I don’t think so.

                         ARNIE
                  It’s not Kate, is it?

          Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnie’s eyes 
          widen...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                    (proudly)
                  You see, it’s like we’re 
                  in each other’s heads...

                         JACK
                  Kate’s my wife...

          Jack looks at Arnie as if he’s seeking confirmation.

                         ARNIE
                    (a playful smile) 
                  Just keep saying it, 
                  Jack, like a mantra.

          Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
          arm.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  C’mon, I better walk ya 
                  home.  She’s mad enough 
                  as it is, right...?

    37     EXT. ARNIE’S YARD - SECONDS LATER

          Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

                         ARNIE
                  Look, you fit the profile 
                  exactly.  Thirties, 
                  house, kids, financial 
                  responsibilities.  You 
                  start thinking...this 
                  isn’t the life I dreamt 
                  about.  Where’s the 
                  romance, where’s the joie 
                  de vivre?  Suddenly, 
                  every lingerie ad in the 
                  Newark Star Ledger 
                  represents a life you 
                  can’t have...

                         JACK
                    (thinking, then...)
                  It’s just two kids, 
                  right?

          A chuckle from Arnie.

                         ARNIE
                  You made a choice, Jack, 
                  a promise to your wife. 
                  Maybe sometimes it seems 
                  like you gave up the 
                  world, but look what you 
                  got...

          They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
          cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
          lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
          built...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  Four bedrooms, two and a 
                  half baths, and a 
                  partially finished 
                  basement...

          Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                    (shaking his head)
                  Kids...

          Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  Okay look, you probably 
                  don’t want to hear this 
                  right now but remember
                  what you told me last 
                  summer when I almost had 
                  that thing with Arnie 
                  Jr.’s speech therapist.

          A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
          glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
          shoulders and looking him in the eye.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  Don’t screw up the best 
                  thing in your life just 
                  because you’re a little 
                  unsure about who you 
                  are.  Okay?

          Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  God, it feels so good to 
                  finally give something 
                  back to you...

          Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
                  I’m gonna hug you now...

          Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
          push toward the door...

    38     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

          Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
          Arnie’s gone.

          Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

                         KATE
                    (into phone)
                  Hold on a second...

          She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, she’s 
          dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

                         JACK
                  You cut your hair...

          A curious look from Kate.

                         KATE
                  Ten years ago...

          Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
          nothing.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Are you okay?

                         JACK
                  Yeah...fine.

          She gives him a resolute nod, then...

                         KATE
                    (into phone)
                  Never mind, he just 
                  walked in...

          Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
          stares him down angrily.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Do you have any idea what 
                  you put us through 
                  today?!  You walk out of 
                  here at 7:30 in the 
                  morning, don’t tell me 
                  where you’re going, or 
                  even that you’re going, 
                  and I don’t see you ‘til 
                  hours later.  I had state 
                  troopers looking for 
                  you!  I called 
                  hospitals...
                    (pointing at 
                     the phone)
                  ...I was just on the 
                  phone with the morgue 
                  for god’s sake!

          Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
          building.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  What kind of man leaves 
                  his family on Christmas 
                  morning without a word 
                  about where he’s going?

          Jack’s almost to a breaking po     INT.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  What kind of man does 
                  that!?

                         JACK
                    (jumping in)
                  I don’t know!  Please 
                  stop yelling at me!

          She looks at him curiously.

                         KATE
                  Where were you?

                         JACK
                  I was in the city.

                         KATE
                  The city?  New York 
                  City?  Why?

                         JACK
                  Because that’s where I 
                  live.

                         KATE
                  Jack...don’t even 
                  start...

                         JACK
                  Look, you don’t 
                  understand.  I woke up 
                  here...and this is very 
                  strange ...this is not my 
                  house...

          A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
          room...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (pointing upstairs)
                  I’m not “Dad...”.  Kate, 
                  you’re not my wife...

          Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

                         KATE
                  You know what, Jack?  
                  It’s not funny this 
                  time.  I’m really angry.

          She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
          no answer.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (loudly)
                  Jack!

          Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
          gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
          RINGING it furiously.

          Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

                         ANNIE
                    (re: bell)
                  What’s that?

          Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
          and takes the bicycle bell...

                         ANNIE (CONT’D)
                    (examining the bell)
                  I like this...
                    (jumping up and 
                     giving hima peck 
                     on the cheek)
                  ...thanks, Dad!

          Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

          Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

                         KATE
                  You missed the whole 
                  thing, Jack.  The 
                  pancakes, the 
                  presents...you spent six 
                  hours putting that bike 
                  together and you didn’t 
                  even get to see the look 
                  on Annie’s face when she 
                  opened it...

          Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  You missed Christmas, 
                  Jack.

          Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
          to the moment...

                         JACK
                  I’m...I’m sorry.

          Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

                         KATE
                  Look, we don’t have time 
                  for this right now, we’ll 
                  talk about it later.  Now 
                  get dressed...
                    (pointing to his 
                     outfit)
                  You’re not wearing that 
                  to the Thompsons’ party.  
                  I don’t care how 
                  hilarious you think it 
                  is...

                         JACK
                  Party?  Oh no, I can’t go 
                  to a party...

                         KATE
                  You look forward to this 
                  party all year.  What’s 
                  with you today?

                         JACK
                  Trust me on this Kate.  I 
                  really don’t think going 
                  to a party is the right 
                  move for me at the 
                  present time.

          Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

                         KATE
                  Fine.  Do whatever you 
                  want.

          She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

                         JACK
                  What are you doing?

                         KATE
                  Telling my mother she 
                  doesn’t have to stay with 
                  the kids.

                         JACK
                  Why not?

                         KATE
                  Because you’ll be here.

          Kate just looks at him.

                         JACK
                  I’ll be ready in ten 
                  minutes.

          He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
          watching him...

          He opens the door...it’s a closet.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Christ...
                    (turning around)
                  Where the hell is the 
                  bathroom?

                         KATE
                  Funny, Jack.  I’m 
                  laughing on the inside.

    39     INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

          The light comes on...

          Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
          collect himself...but something’s not right...

          He glances around...the bathroom is small and it’s 
          cluttered with Kate’s razors, loofah, skin creams...

          ...none of this stuff is his...

          ...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
          forlorn sense of displacement...

          ...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
          anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

          After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
          face...

    40     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

          Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
          slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
          shoes...

          He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
          sport coats.

                         JACK
                  This is just...
                    (searching for 
                     the words)
                  ...this is sub-par...

          Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
          closet.

          He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
          exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

          Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
          pair of the slacks...

    41     EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

          Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
          the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
          decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
          decorations this side of Pasaic.

          Kate RINGS the doorbell...

          EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress that’s a bit too 
          tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

                         EVELYN
                  Kate!  Jack!
                    (turning around, 
                     to guests)
                  Everybody, Jack and Kate 
                  are here!

          Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
          GUESTS.

          A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
          condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A     INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jack’s 
          arm...

                         EVELYN
                    (suggestively)
                  Like the dress...?

                         JACK
                    (glancing at it)
                     It’s lovely...

                         EVELYN
                    (a satisfied smile)
                  I thought I saw you 
                  notice it at the kids’ 
                  recital.

          Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
          to catch up with Kate...

    42     INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
          b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

          Jack’s eyes dart around the room...it’s large, neater 
          than his and Kate’s house but still very lived in...The 
          Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
          new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
          imported from Europe, but everyone’s having a good 
          time...

          ...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
          THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
          walking advertisement for Levi’s Cotton Dockers...

                         NICK
                  Did you see Van Horn last 
                  night?  This kid’s gonna 
                  single-handedly save 
                  basketball in the state 
                  of New Jersey...

                         JACK
                  The Nets?  You’re kidding, 
                  right...?

          Nick looks at him in disbelief.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (recovering)
                  Well...they’re certainly 
                  due.

          BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
          plate, tugs at Jack’s shirt.

                         BILL KRAMER
                  So tomorrow’s the big 
                  day, Jackie...

                         JACK
                  Okay...why?

                         BILL KRAMER
                  Triple bypass.  I’m going 
                  under the knife.  I told 
                  you, didn’t I?

                         JACK
                  Triple bypass?
                    (pointing to his 
                     plate)
                  You really think you 
                  should be eating all 
                  that?

                         BILL KRAMER
                  Why not?  I figure I’m 
                  going in for a cleaning 
                  tomorrow, I might as well 
                  load up on the fried 
                  stuff tonight...

                         ARNIE
                  Good thinking, Bill.  
                  Have another drink.
                    (whispering to Jack)
                  He’ll be lucky if he 
                  lives through the 
                  night...

          Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
          Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
          politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

          Nick lights Jack’s cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
          first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
          puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but it’s an 
          effort...

          Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
          hand...

                         EVELYN
                    (holding out a 
                     puff to Jack)
                  Finger food...?

                         JACK
                  I don’t think so, thank 
                  you...

                         EVELYN
                    (suggestively)
                  C’mon, as soon as I put 
                  them down, you’re gonna 
                  grab a couple...you 
                  always do...

          Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
          other side of the room...Kate watches as...

          Evelyn holds the puff up to Jack’s mouth, slowly 
          putting it near his lips...

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
                  Let me.  They’ll melt in 
                  your mouth...

          He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
          treat inside...

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
                  Good?

          On Jack’s face...if freezer burn were a facial 
          expression, this would be it...

                         JACK
                    (forcing a smile) 
                  They’re great!  Thank 
                  you!

          ...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
          Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

          A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

                         EVELYN
                  Mushroom puffs aren’t the 
                  only thing I do well...

                         JACK
                  Well do whatever it is 
                  you do well, and 
                  just...just do it.  
                  Excuse me...

          Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

          Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
          stairs...

    43     INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

          Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
          guests’ coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
          telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

                         JACK
                    (loudly, into phone)
                  ...what do you mean he 
                  won’t come to the phone?!
                    (standing, indignant)
                  Do you realize how much 
                  money I’ve made for that 
                  sonuvabitch in the last 
                  eight years?!

          Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Damnit!

          He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

                         KATE (O.S.)
                  Jack...?

          Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
          him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
          her face.

                         KATE
                  Are you sure you’re 
                  okay...?

          A forced smile from Jack.

                         JACK
                  Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just 
                  this god awful football 
                  phone!  Who has a phone 
                  like this anyway?!

                         KATE
                    (doubtful)  
                  Uh huh...

          Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  You must really love 
                  Evelyn’s mushroom puffs, 
                  huh?
                    (with a wink)
                  You know they’re not 
                  real...

          She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44     INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
          He looks across the room and sees...

          Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
          jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

          Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
          slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

          He catches Kate’s eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

                         KATE
                    (to guests)
                  ...then she asks me to 
                  put this sweater on.  
                  What choice do I have, 
                  right?

          Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  But as I’m slipping it on 
                  I notice she’s misspelled 
                  the word “lawyers.”
                    (laughing)
                  I had to go through the 
                  entire day wearing a hand 
                  embroidered sweater that 
                  said, “Non-Profit Layers 
                  Do It For Free.”

          The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
          laughing, until...

                         JACK
                    (to Kate, off-hand)
                  So you’re a lawyer...?

          A chuckle from the group.  Kate’s confused.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  A non-profit lawyer...

          People are starting to LAUGH.

                         KATE
                    (a little embarrassed)
                  Jack...

                         JACK
                  Pro bono.  You don’t get 
                  paid at all.  Nobody 
                  makes a dime.  Well, 
                  bravo...

          Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

          CUT TO:

    45     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

          Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
          them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
          face.

                         KATE
                  I better go wake my
                  mother...

          Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Here you go...

                         JACK
                  You’re kidding me...

                         KATE
                  She’s your dog, Jack.

                         JACK
                  No, she’s not.

                         KATE
                  Fine, she’s the kid’s 
                  dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, 
                  see if he wants to walk 
                  her.

                         JACK
                  But it’s twenty degrees 
                  outside...

                         KATE
                    (sympathetic)
                  You’re having a bad day, 
                  I’ll go with 
                  you...actually, there’s 
                  no way in hell you’re 
                  gettin’ me back out 
                  there...

          Jack looks at the dog’s face.  Lucy couldn’t be more 
          excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
          leash.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (heading up the 
                     stairs)
                  Make sure you reward her 
                  verbally when she does a 
                  number two...

          CUT TO:

    46     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

          The sound of CRICKETS.

          Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
          street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
          winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
          of garbage cans, but isn’t doing her business.

                         JACK
                  Figure it out...I’m s
                  crewed...don’t have to 
                  be a genius to figure 
                  that out...

          The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (to Lucy)
                  It’s as good a place as 
                  any...

          But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  ...but obviously not up 
                  to your high standards...
                    (to himself)
                  Okay...he said you’re 
                  working on a new deal 
                  now...fine, you’ve done a 
                  thousand deals, what’s 
                  the first thing you do?

          Lucy’s sniffing around someone’s Christmas display but 
          Jack’s too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Triage.  It’s your 
                  signature.  You survey 
                  the damage, find out 
                  everything you can, you 
                  probe, leave nothing to 
                  chance.  I’m just gonna 
                  have to go detective.  
                  How did you get 
                  Mentadent?  You learned 
                  everything there was to 
                  know about toothpaste and 
                  then you pounced...

          Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  That’s our play here...

          Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  If you could take a dump 
                  some time in this 
                  century, then we could go 
                  home where it’s warm...

          Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  That is if I can even 
                  remember how to get 
                  home...
                    (to Lucy)
                  You remember, don’t you 
                  girl?

          But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

          Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
          cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

          He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
          on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
          pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
          resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

          CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
     
    48     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
          “7:14.”

          Jack opens his eyes – a burst of light hitting them 
          from the window...like the morning light in his 
          Manhattan loft...

          He reaches across the bed...it’s empty...

          A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
          the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

          The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
          pained look on Jack’s face as he realizes he’s still in 
          Jersey.

          Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
          hoping it’ll stop...it doesn’t.  Then, he hears the 
          sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

          He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49     INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING “Beast 
          of Burden.”  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
          the song...

                         JACK
                  Hello?

          No answer...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (louder, over music)
                  Hello!

                         KATE
                    (singing)
                  ...my feet are hurtin’...

                         JACK
                    (yelling)
                  HEY!

          Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
          shower curtain open...

          Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...that’s 
          something he’s missed...then...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Uh...that baby’s crying...

                         KATE
                    (unimpressed)
                  And...?

          ...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
          naked body.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Don’t give me that look, 
                  Jack, Tuesday’s your day 
                  and you know it.  And try 
                  to get Josh to day care 
                  on time, okay?  He missed 
                  the macaroni painting 
                  last week...

          She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

          CUT TO:

    50     INT. JOSH’S ROOM - MORNING

          Annie’s watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
          as...

          Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
          Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
          plastic keys.

          Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
          the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
          rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
          grabs at Jack’s nose.

          He looks over to Annie.  She’s still staring at him 
          like he’s a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
          the box of Huggies.

                         JACK
                  Pull tape...

          Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
          gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
          the baby’s bottom, and seeing what’s inside.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Holy mother of god!

          Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
          a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
          the dresser.

          Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
          lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  You must be kidding...

          Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

                         ANNIE
                  You’re not really our 
                  dad, are you?

          Jack turns to her.  She’s looking back at him with 
          complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
          moment.  Then...

                         JACK
                  No, I’m not.

          A look of curiosity from Annie.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  I work on Wall Street, 
                  you know with the big 
                  buildings...?

          No response from Annie...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  I live in an apartment 
                  house with a doorman, I 
                  can buy just about 
                  anything I want...

          Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  This isn’t my real life.  
                  It’s just a glimpse...

                         ANNIE
                  Where’s my real dad?

                         JACK
                  I don’t know...

          A concerned look on Annie’s face, Jack’s petrified that 
          she’s about to cry.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  But don’t worry, he loves 
                  you and I’m sure he’ll be 
                  back very soon...
                    (to himself)
                  ...very, very soon...

          Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
          and tugging firmly at his hair.

                         ANNIE
                  They did a pretty good 
                  job.

                         JACK
                  Who did?

                         ANNIE
                  The aliens...In the 
                  mother ship.  You look 
                  just like him.

                         JACK
                  Uhh...thanks...slightly 
                  better looking though, 
                  right?

          Annie’s now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  You’re not going to start 
                  crying, are you?  Because 
                  I’m not really sure I 
                  could deal with that 
                  right now.

          She thinks about it for a moment.

                         ANNIE
                  Do you like kids?

                         JACK
                  On a case by case 
                  basis...

                         ANNIE
                  You know how to make 
                  chocolate milk?

                         JACK
                  I think I could figure it 
                  out.

                         ANNIE
                  You promise not to kidnap 
                  me and my brother and 
                  implant stuff in our brains?

                         JACK
                  Sure.

          Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

                         ANNIE
                  Welcome to earth.

    51     INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

          Jack’s driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

          Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
          monkeys – his shirt buttons are off by one, and they’re 
          clearly supposed to be in the back.

                         ANNIE
                  Stop here...

          Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
          Center.

                         ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  This is day care.  It’s 
                  where babies go when 
                  their parents are at 
                  work.

                         JACK
                  Check...

          He gets out of the van...

    52     EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

          ...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
          building, holding the baby away from his body.

          He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
          LADY.  She stares at Josh’s outfit...

                         JACK
                  Do I get a receipt or 
                  something...?

          The woman looks at Jack like he’s crazy.

    53     EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
          suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

                         ANNIE
                  I have winter camp until 
                  four, then ballet until 
                  five thirty.

                         JACK
                  Five thirty.  Okay.

                         ANNIE
                  Try not to be late 
                  because kids don’t like 
                  to be the last one picked 
                  up.

                         JACK
                  Got it.  Good tip.

                         ANNIE
                  Bye...

          CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

          Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
          Then...

                         JACK
                    (calling out window)
                  Hey!  Annie!

          Annie turns back toward him.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Where do I go now?

                         ANNIE
                  Big Ed’s.

                         JACK
                  Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s 
                  Tires?
                    (suspicious)
                  Why...?

                         ANNIE
                  That’s where you work.

          A beat.  Then...

                         JACK
                  You mean I sell tires...

          She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  That’s what I do.  I’m a 
                  tire salesman...

          CUT TO:

    54     INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack’s driving down a busy commercial street when he 
          spots something a hundred yards down the road...

                         JACK
                  Good Lord...

          ...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
          Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55     EXT. BIG ED’S TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack approaches Big Ed’s from the parking lot...slowly, 
          taking it all in...

          It’s like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
          store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
          everything from alignments to brake jobs...

          Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
          Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
          with TOMMY the salesman.

                         TOMMY
                  Hey Jack, you happen to 
                  know the stock number on 
                  those new Michelin X1's?

                         JACK
                  Uh...lemme get back to 
                  you on that one...
                    (looking at his 
                     name tag)
                  Tommy...

                         HECTOR
                    (to Tommy)
                  Thomas, why you bother 
                  Jack about that.  Look it 
                  up yourself...
                    (to Jack)
                  Okay Jack, we talk 
                  later...

          Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56     INT. BIG ED’S TIRES - CONTINUOUS

          Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
          with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

          Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
          behind the counter...

                         BIG ED
                  Jack my boy!  You are 
                  looking mighty worse for 
                  the wear...Hey, guess who
                  I played bridge with two 
                  nights ago...?

          Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

                         BIG ED (CONT’D) 
                  Hell, you’ll never 
                  guess.  One Sydney 
                  Potter.  That’s Sydney 
                  Potter, Chief Executive 
                  Officer of BuyRite 
                  Transport.  Only the 
                  third largest trucking 
                  company in the state.  I 
                  even let the sonuvabitch 
                  win, which wasn’t easy 
                  because the guy’s been 
                  bashed in the head by 
                  Teamsters so many times 
                  his brain’s like 
                  porridge.  Anyhoo, he’s 
                  looking for a new parts 
                  supplier... we can handle 
                  that kind of volume, 
                  right?

          Jack considers this briefly.

                         JACK
                  I’m gonna have to get 
                  back to you on that...Ed.

          Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
          at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
          as...

          Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
          by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Do I have a private 
                  office somewhere in the 
                  building?

                         KENNY
                  Uh...sure Jack...
                    (nervously pointing)
                  Right back there...

                         JACK
                  Thank you.

          Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57     INT. JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          There’s no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
          bar...it’s small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
          littered with tire inventory and price lists...

          Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

          He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
          the room and sits down behind it...

          On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
          plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
          and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
          “Bowlers Do It In An Alley” embossed on its base...

          He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
          drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
          inside...

          He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
          back...

          Jack picks up the “Bowlers Do It In An Alley” figurine 
          and gives it a good look...

                         JACK
                  Bowlers do it in an 
                  alley?...Non profit 
                  lawyers do it for free... 
                  what is it with these 
                  people?  Don’t they 
                  realize this refers to 
                  sex?

          He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
          where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
          out...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  At least you splurged on 
                  some decent scotch...

          He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
          drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
          cup, throwing it toward the NET’S basketball 
          hoop/garbage can near the door.

          He misses...

          He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
          family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
          the pony rides, at Josh’s birth...in every one of them, 
          Jack is smiling...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (to Jack in 
                     the photo)
                  What are you smiling 
                  about...?

          He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
          behind him.  It reads, “Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
          Junior Sales Associate, 1988.”  Jack raises an 
          eyebrow...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Number one...not bad.

          He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
          carefully...

                         JACK (CONT’D)

                  1988...?  I was in London 
                  in 1988...

          Jack’s jarred into reality...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (to Jack in the photo)
                  You never went to London...
                    (picking up the photo)
                  ...you never got on that 
                  plane...

          He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

          The P.A. system comes to life...

                         ESTELLE
                    (over P.A.)
                  Jack to mag 
                  wheels...Jack, you’re 
                  needed in mag wheels, 
                  customer waiting!

          CUT TO:

    58     INT. BIG ED’S TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

          Kenny leading Jack toward the “Mag Wheels” section.

                         JACK
                  ...I was the number one 
                  junior sales associate at 
                  E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
                  you know that?

                         KENNY
                  No, I didn’t...that’s 
                  great.

                         JACK
                  That’s the kind of thing 
                  you can really build 
                  on...

                         KENNY
                  Uh huh...

                         JACK
                  I mean sales has always 
                  been a feeder for M and 
                  A, always...

          They approach “Mag Wheels” where TOMMY, a slick sales 
          associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
          displays...

                         KENNY
                  Here we are, mag wheels...
                    (a little concerned)
                  Hey Jack, are you sure 
                  you’re okay?

                         JACK
                  Well, I’m just a little 
                  confused right now about 
                  why I work here...

          Kenny looks at him nervously.

                         KENNY
                  Uh...I just started here 
                  last Tuesday.

          Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
          Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
          the customer.

                         TOMMY
                    (to the customer)
                  So you’re all set on the 
                  Skip Shift eliminator and 
                  the Brembo rotors.  
                  Jack’s our point man on 
                  alloy wheels...

                         JACK
                    (turning to Tommy)
                  Do you know why do I work 
                  here...?

                         TOMMY
                  Because you’re the best 
                  damn tire guy in the 
                  state of New Jersey...
                    (proudly, to the 
                     customer)
                  Jack taught me everything 
                  I know about the 
                  business...

          The customer nods, impressed.

                         JACK
                  I taught you the business?

          Another nod to the customer.

                         TOMMY
                  And he’s a crack-up.

                         JACK
                  Everything I taught you.  
                  I want to hear it all, 
                  right now.

          Tommy’s confused.

                         CUSTOMER
                  Hey, I’m ready to buy 
                  here...

                         JACK
                    (to the customer)
                  What do you want?

                         CUSTOMER
                  I want some alloy wheels.

          Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
          it out to the customer.

                         JACK
                  Here.  These are great.  
                  You’ll need four.

          The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
          confused...

                         CUSTOMER
                  But I don’t like these...

                         JACK
                  Hey, you heard the guy, 
                  I’m the best damn tire 
                  guy in the state of New 
                  Jersey.
                    (turning to Tommy)
                  Everything.

                         TOMMY
                  Okay...
                    (hesitating)
                  Rule number one, the 
                  customer is always 
                  right...

          A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59     INT. BIG ED’S TIRES, JACK’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
          phone...

                         JACK
                    (into phone)
                  ...I have no idea what 
                  our inventory level is, 
                  that’s why I’m asking 
                  you...

          A KNOCK at the door...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Look, just send us what 
                  you sent us last month, 
                  okay...?  And keep doing 
                  that until further 
                  notice...

          He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
          his head in...

                         BIG ED
                  Got a minute, Jack?

                         JACK
                  I’ve got all the time in 
                  the world...

          Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
          tough looking man...

                         BIG ED
                  Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
                  BuyRite Transport, one of 
                  Jersey’s top 
                  businessmen...

          Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
          trying to place the name.  Then...

                         JACK
                  ...and a helluva bridge 
                  player.  Ed’s told me a 
                  lot about you...

          They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
          immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

                         POTTER
                    (in a heavy Jersey 
                     accent)
                  Lucky in cards, lucky in 
                  business, lucky in love.  
                  My cup runneth over...
                    (to Big Ed)
                  He’s a nice looking 
                  boy...

                         BIG ED
                  My daughter’s no slouch 
                  either...

          A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

                         POTTER
                  Let’s cut to the chase, 
                  Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
                  you’re the grease that 
                  makes the wheels turn 
                  around here.  I need a 
                  new parts supplier for my 
                  fleet.  You seem to have 
                  the parts.  That we 
                  know.  What we don’t know 
                  is why the hell I should 
                  buy them from you.

          Potter stares Jack down.  But Jack’s not about to be 
          intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potter’s 
          stare.  Then...

                         JACK
                  I have no idea...

          A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
          Big Ed.

                         BIG ED
                    (nervous)
                  C’mon Jack...

                         JACK
                    (to Potter)
                  I mean it.  From what I 
                  can tell, we’re a mom and 
                  pop operation, we’re 
                  already over-extended in 
                  sales, and any price 
                  advantage we could offer 
                  would easily be matched 
                  by a larger supplier...

          Jack continues to stare down Potter.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  So like I said, I don’t 
                  have any idea why you 
                  should buy your parts 
                  from us...

          The staring match continues.  Big Ed’s getting more 
          nervous.  Potter’s the first to blink.

                         POTTER
                  Okay, you got my 
                  attention...

                         JACK
                  Except for rule number 
                  one...

          Jack smiles.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  The customer is always 
                  right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
                  The difference is, we 
                  mean it.  We’re small, we 
                  need our customers.  We 
                  can’t afford to 
                  disappoint them, ever. 
                  Yeah, you could go to 
                  some leviathan supplier, 
                  probably save a few 
                  pennies on the price of 
                  oil filters, but with us 
                  you get more than a 
                  supplier, you get a 
                  bridge partner...

          A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
          watches, thrilled...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  You want to bid hearts, 
                  we’re right there with 
                  you.  You feel the need 
                  to redouble, you’re not 
                  going to get any argument 
                  from us...

          Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  The big guys may have the 
                  high cards, but you know 
                  as well as I do, Sydney, 
                  high cards don’t always 
                  take the trick.

          Potter pauses a minute, then...

                         POTTER
                    (to Big Ed, 
                     re: Jack)
                  I like him...

          Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

                         BIG ED
                    (a wink to Jack)
                  That’s my boy...
                    (an arm around Potter)
                  C’mon, lemme show you the 
                  rest of the ranch...

          Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

                         BIG ED (CONT’D)
                    (turning back to Jack)
                  Nice shootin’, Jack...

          ...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
          face.

    60     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
          REPORTER at the anchor’s desk...

                         CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
                  ...advancers led 
                  decliners by a nine to 
                  four ratio and the 
                  closing tick was a mildly 
                  bullish plus seventy 
                  six.  Much of the 
                  market’s action today was 
                  fueled by the latest 
                  round of merger mania to 
                  hit Wall Street...

          The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
          graphic in the corner of the screen...

                         CNBC REPORTER (CONT’D, ON T.V.)
                  ...when Global Health 
                  Systems and MedTech 
                  Pharmaceutical announced 
                  their intentions to join 
                  forces in a massive one 
                  hundred and twenty two 
                  billion dollar stock swap 
                  deal.  Though neither 
                  side expressed 
                  significant regulatory 
                  concerns at the 
                  announcement press 
                  conference, it is 
                  believed that both the 
                  FDA and the FTC will be 
                  closely scrutinizing the 
                  marriage, the largest 
                  ever in the health care 
                  industry.  When asked 
                  about possible anti-
                  competitive implications, 
                  Global Chairman Bob 
                  Thomas referred reporters 
                  to P.K. Lassiter and 
                  Company President Alan 
                  Mintz, the original 
                  architect behind the 
                  deal...

          Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
          confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas’ hand at the 
          press conference.

                         CNBC REPORTER (CONT’D, ON T.V.)
                  Ironically, Mintz first 
                  met Thomas at a Lamaze 
                  class...

                         JACK
                  A Lamaze class...!?

                         CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
                  ...while coaching their 
                  pregnant wives, Mintz and T
                  homas struck up a 
                  dialogue about the need 
                  for consolidation in the 
                  rapidly growing health 
                  care industry and two 
                  months later, the deal 
                  with MedTech was born...

                         JACK
                  What?!  That’s my deal?

                         CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
                  In other business news, 
                  U.S. Labor Department 
                  officials announced today
                  that two hundred and 
                  seventy-five thousand new
                  jobs were created last 
                  month, twenty-five 
                  thousand less than 
                  economists were 
                  predicting, leading to a 
                  mild rally in the bond 
                  markets before midday.  
                  But as the trading 
                  session drew to a close, 
                  the profit takers stepped 
                  in and the long bond 
                  closed at ninety seven 
                  even, up only two ticks, 
                  the yield inching down to 
                  six point zero seven 
                  percent...

          Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
          Jack’s NYU sweatshirt...

                         KATE
                  The kids are asleep...

          She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
          looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Jack.  I said the kids 
                  are asleep...

                         JACK
                    (distracted)
                  Well that’s just 
                  great...those little 
                  monkeys can be a real 
                  handful...

          Kate shuts off the TV.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  Hey!  I was watching 
                  that!

                         KATE
                  I thought we had a deal 
                  about you watching CNBC 
                  in bed.

                         JACK
                  I’m working on a new deal 
                  now...

          Kate throws a Kate Bush’s “The Sensual World” into the 
          CD player.

                         KATE
                  Fine, but not tonight...

          She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

                         JACK
                  Wait a second.  You want 
                  me, don’t you?

                         KATE
                  That is the general idea, 
                  yes...

          Kate starts kissing him...but Jack’s a little 
          uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
          a little nervous.

                         JACK
                  Shouldn’t we grab some 
                  dinner first?  Maybe a 
                  bottle of wine...?

                         KATE
                  It’s ten thirty, Jack.  
                  By eleven you’re gonna be 
                  sprawled out on the bed 
                  snoring your head off.  
                  We don’t have time for 
                  wining and dining.

                         JACK
                  Whatever you say...honey.

          She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
          goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
          he’s brought back to a different time and place...

          Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...it’s 
          like the first time he’s really looked at her in eleven 
          years...


                         JACK (CONT’D)
                  God...you’re beautiful...

          She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
          compliment...

                         KATE
                  Thanks, Jack...

                         JACK
                  No, I’m serious...you’re 
                  really stunning...

                         KATE
                  This is good stuff, Jack, 
                  keep it coming...

                         JACK
                  I mean back in college, 
                  you were a very pretty 
                  girl, there’s no question 
                  about that.  But this...
                    (lost in her)
                  ...you’ve really grown 
                  into a beautiful woman...

          Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
          reacting to the intensity in his stare...

                         KATE
                  How can you do that?

                         JACK
                    (nervous)
                  Do what?

                         KATE
                  Look at me like you 
                  haven’t seen me every day 
                  for the last twelve 
                  years...

          Jack freezes.  There’s love in her eyes but it’s not 
          meant for him...

          She kisses him...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  Don’t move.

          She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

          He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

          He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

          Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
          bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

          At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
          turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

          She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
          light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
          sweetly on the neck...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                  ‘night, honey...

          Close in on Jack’s face...turned away from Kate...he 
          opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
          his face...

          CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MEN’S DEPARTMENT

          DISSOLVE TO:

    61     EXT. MALL - DAY

          It’s mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
          gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
          lot.

    62     INT. MACY’S, MEN’S DEPT. - DAY

          Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annie’s 
          hand, passing through the Men’s Dept., Jack lagging 
          behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
          beleaguered look on his face.

                         KATE
                    (back to Jack)
               We’re almost done here...

                         ANNIE
               Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
               promised.

                         KATE
               That’s right.  Okay, 
               let’s make a quick stop 
               at the kids’ shoe 
               department, pick up my 
               watch from the battery 
               place, then I’ll run into 
               the linen store...

          An unhappy look on Jack’s face.

                         JACK
               Why don’t we just go to 
               all the stores?!

          Kate looks back at Jack.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Every single store in 
               this godforsaken shopping 
               mall.  We can go to them 
               all.

          Kate gives him a look.  Then...

                         KATE
               You know what, Jack?!  
               I’ll go with the kids.  
               Why don’t you just hang 
               out here in the men’s 
               department... okay?

          Jack glances at the Men’s Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
          nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
          it...

          ...the Zegna section.  He’s drawn to the neat rows of 
          beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

          He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
          gently touching the soft wool.

                         SALESMAN (O.S.)
               It’s perfect for your 
               frame...

          Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

                         SALESMAN 
               Would you like to try it 
               on?

          CUT TO:

    63     INT. MACY’S MEN’S DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
          perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
          line is dazzling.

          Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
          out... it’s like he’s seeing his old self...

                         KATE (O.S.)
               You look amazing in that 
               suit...

          Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
          behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
          away.
                         KATE
               I mean...wow...off the 
               charts great.

                         JACK
               It’s an unbelievable 
               thing.  Wearing this suit 
               actually makes me feel 
               like a better person.
                    (taking one final 
                     look)
               I’m gonna buy it...

          Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

                         KATE
               $2,400?!  Are you out of 
               your mind?

                         JACK
                    (pointing to Annie’s 
                     new Mary Janes)
               She got those shoes...

                         KATE
               Those shoes were twenty 
               five dollars.  C’mon, 
               take it off.  We’ll go to 
               the food court and get 
               one of those funnel cakes 
               you like.

          Jack looks at her...it’s a moment of decision.

                         JACK
               No.

          Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

                         KATE
               No?

                         JACK
               Do you have any idea what 
               my life is like?

                         KATE
               Excuse me?

                         JACK
               I wake up in the morning 
               covered in dog saliva...I 
               drop the kids off, spend 
               eight hours selling tires 
               retail...retail, Kate.

          Kate just stands here, aghast...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I pick up the kids, walk
               the dog, which by the 
               way, carries the added 
               bonus of carting away her
               monstrous crap...I play 
               with the kids, take out 
               the garbage, get six 
               hours of sleep if I’m 
               lucky, and then it starts 
               all over again...and why 
               is it that I always have 
               to drive everyone 
               everywhere?  I spend 
               practically my entire day 
               in that slow as hell 
               mini-van listening to 
               Raffi tapes and trying to 
               figure out how the cup 
               holders work...I’m sick 
               of it.

                         KATE
               Really.

                         JACK
               What’s in it for me?  
               Where are my Mary Janes?

          Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

                         KATE
               It’s sad to hear your 
               life is such a 
               disappointment to you, 
               Jack.

                         JACK
               I can’t believe it’s not 
               a disappointment to you!
                    (letting it all out)
               Jesus, Kate, I could’ve 
               been a thousand times the 
               man I became.  How could 
               you do this to me?  How 
               could you let me give up 
               on my dreams like this?!

          Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

                         KATE
               Who are you?

          Kate’s words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

                         JACK
                    (lowering his voice)
               Look, I’m sorry.  I’m 
               sorry I was such a saint 
               before and I’m such a 
               prick now.  Maybe I’m 
               just not the same guy I 
               was when we got 
               married...

                         KATE
               Maybe you’re not.  The 
               Jack Campbell I married 
               wouldn’t need a $2400 
               suit to make himself feel 
               better about his life, 
               but if that’s what it’s 
               gonna take, then buy it.  
               Just buy the goddamn 
               suit ...we can take the 
               money out of the kids’ 
               college fund.

          They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

                         JACK
               Forget it...
                    (taking off the 
                     jacket)
               We’ll get a funnel cake.  
               It’ll be the highlight of 
               my week...

    64     EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

          The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65     INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

          There’s an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
          wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
          on her face...
 
          CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

          Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
          in the back, both asleep...

                         JACK
                    (to Kate)
               Listen, I’m sorry about 
               that back in the store.  
               I really don’t want to 
               fight with you...

          Kate just keeps looking out the window.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               But you must sometimes 
               wonder how we ended up 
               here.  I mean back in 
               college, did you see 
               us...
                    (looking around)
               ...here...?

          She turns to him.

                         KATE
               I’ll give you this, life 
               has thrown us a few 
               surprises...

          A glimmer in Jack’s eye...

                         JACK
               It really has, hasn’t 
               it?  So if you had 
               to...what would you say 
               was the biggest surprise?

          She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

                         KATE
               Well...Annie for one.

                         JACK
               Surprise.  We’re 
               pregnant...
                    (a laugh)
               Yeah...that must’ve 
               been...I mean that was 
               very unexpected.  But 
               what are you gonna do, 
               right?

                         KATE
               I think it worked out 
               okay, don’t you?

                         JACK
               Sure.  I really like 
               Annie.

                         KATE
               Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll 
               keep her.

                         JACK
               No, I love Annie.  We had 
               a lot of good times, 
               didn’t we?

                         KATE
               We were young...
                    (a nostalgic smile)
               Remember that little 
               place on Charles Street 
               we used to go to?

                         JACK
               Charles Street?  In the 
               Village?  When we were 
               living in Greenwich 
               Village...?
                    (off her nod)
               Great times.  Why’d we 
               ever leave?

                         KATE
               You can’t really raise a 
               kid in an apartment in 
               the Village...

          Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               The trek out to the 
               hospital every day didn’t 
               help either...
                    (looking at him)
               You were great.  
               Surviving the heart 
               attack was one thing...

                         JACK
               You had a heart attack?

                         KATE
                    (a laugh)
               Jack, stop that. I'm
               still mad at you...
                    (a sigh)
               ...who knows what 
               would’ve happened if you 
               hadn’t stepped in at the 
               store.

                         JACK
               That’s why I work for Big 
               Ed?

          A look from Kate.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (recovering)
               I mean, that’s why I work 
               for Big Ed...

          Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
          together in his mind.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (almost to himself)
               So we had a baby, Big Ed 
               had a heart attack, we b
               ought that house, and 
               I’ve been working for him 
               ever since...Sayonara, 
               Wall Street.

          Kate looks at him a little strangely.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (turning to her)
               Our life in a nutshell...

                         KATE
               If you want to look at it 
               that way...

                         JACK
               How would you look at it?

          She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
          Jack.

                         KATE
               A great success story...

          A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
          can’t bring himself to share it.

          DISSOLVE TO:

    66     INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

          A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

          Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
          nickname “The Hammer” emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
          pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
          down the lane...

          It’s ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
          gutter.

                         JACK
               Damn...

                         ARNIE
                    (O.S., from behind)
               Jesus, Jack, this is a 
               league match, for god’s 
               sake!

          Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
          scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
          sport.  Jack scowls.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
               Where’s your follow 
               through?  Where’s your 
               stance?

                         JACK
               Hey, I’m doing the best I 
               can...
                    (under his breath)
               I’d like to see you hit a 
               squash ball after 
               seventeen beers...

                         ARNIE
               You’re right.  Why am I 
               so competitive!?  
               Compensation, I guess.  
               Look, just focus, Jack.  
               You can still pick up the 
               spare...

          Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
          concentrating...

                         JACK
                    (quietly, to 
                     himself)
               You are Jack Campbell.  
               You’re better than this 
               sport.  You shot the 
               rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
               with the bulls at 
               Pamplona.  You jumped out 
               of a plane over the 
               Mojave Desert, for 
               Christ’s sake.  You can 
               do this...

          Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
          ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
          can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
          others.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (screaming, excited)
               Yeah!!

          He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
          less...

                         ARNIE
                    (to TEAMMATE)
               Okay, Pete, you’re up.

    67     INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

          Jack walks out of the men’s room, heading toward the 
          lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
          woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
          bowling ball to a far lane.

                         EVELYN
               Hi Jack...

          A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
          Then...

                         JACK
               Evelyn, right?

                         EVELYN
               Very funny.  I saw you 
               out there on lane five.  
               What do you have the flu 
               or something?

                         JACK
               Something like that.

                         EVELYN
                    (with a wink)
               Need a nurse?

                         JACK
               You’re a nurse?

          Evelyn laughs.

                         EVELYN
               If that’s what you 
               want...

          She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
          follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

                         JACK
               Wait a second...

          She turns.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Are we...?

                         EVELYN
               Are we what, Jack?

                         JACK
               Is there something going 
               on between us?

          Evelyn’s surprised at Jack’s directness.  She stands 
          there a beat, then walks back toward him.

                         EVELYN
               Are we finally being 
               honest?

                         JACK
               It would help me if we 
               were.

                         EVELYN
               Okay, you’re right, we’ve 
               been dancing around this 
               for years...

          Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
          face.

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
               God, my heart is racing.  
               Here goes...
                    (a smile)
               When I get dressed for a 
               party and I know you’re 
               going to be there... 
               well, let’s just say I 
               don’t go strapless 
               because my husband likes 
               it...

          An intrigued smile from Jack.

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
               I’ve got six sets of snow 
               tires piled up in my 
               garage and I won’t even 
               drive in the snow...And 
               our kids just happen to 
               be in the same ballet 
               class every year?

          She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
               So, if you’re asking me 
               whether I’d like it to be 
               more, the answer is 
               yes...

          A look of surprise from Jack.

                         EVELYN (CONT’D)
               ...and Kate would never 
               have to know.

          Jack considers this for a moment.

                         JACK
               Do I have your number?

          A wide smile from Evelyn.

                         EVELYN
               Steve’s out of town with 
               the kids this week.  Why 
               don’t you just stop by...

          She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
          sashay back to her lane.

    68     INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

          Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
          over to Arnie who’s having a beer at the bar.

                         ARNIE
                    (looking at Jack)
               Hey Jack, you’re all 
               flush.  I guess that 
               seventy-one took a lot 
               outta you.

                         JACK
                    (sitting down)
               I just saw Evelyn 
               Thompson.

                         ARNIE
               She is relentless.

                         JACK
               She wants to have an 
               affair with me.

                         ARNIE
               She said that?

                         JACK
               Pretty much.

                         ARNIE
               Oh yeah...
                    (shaking his head)
               What is it about you?

                         JACK
                    (pushing over a 
                     napkin)
               So could you write down 
               her exact address?

                         ARNIE
               Whoa...whoa...wait a 
               second, Jack.  You’re not 
               actually gonna cheat on 
               Kate?

                         JACK
               It wouldn’t really be 
               cheating...
                    (off Arnie’s 
                     doubtful  look)
               It’s complicated.

                         ARNIE
               Look, maybe I’m not as 
               good a consigliere as you 
               are but you have to trust 
               me on this one.  A little 
               flirtation’s harmless but 
               you’re playing with fire 
               here.  The Fidelity Bank 
               and Trust is a tough 
               creditor.  You make a 
               deposit somewhere else, 
               they close your account 
               forever.

                         JACK
               I’m telling you, those 
               rules don’t apply to me, 
               Arn.

                         ARNIE
                    (a chuckle)
               Screw the rules.  I’m 
               talking about the choice.

          Jack looks at him curiously.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
               C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s 
               got no class.  She 
               doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, 
               the woman’s living in a 
               trailer.

                         JACK
               Hey, is that really 
               necessary?

                         ARNIE
               All I’m saying it there 
               isn’t a guy in Union 
               County who wouldn’t give 
               his left nut to be 
               married to Kate...

          Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
               I’ll see ya later, 
               Jack...

          He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

          CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

          Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
          dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
          kitchen where...

          Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
          some legal documents.

                         KATE
                    (not looking up)
               How was the game, honey?

                         JACK
                    (opening the fridge)
               Long, boring, and 
               generally pretty sad.  
               Arnie seemed to enjoy 
               it...
                    (peering inside)
               Hey, where’s that chocolate 
               cake...?

          Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
          cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
          into her mouth.

                         KATE
                    (with a smile)
               You mean this chocolate 
               cake?

                         JACK
               That’s my piece.  I was 
               saving it because I got 
               nauseated from that store 
               bought chicken.

          Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
          the side of her mouth.

                         KATE
               It’s good...

          Jack approaches the counter.

                         JACK
               Gimme that cake.

          She takes another bite.

                         KATE
               No way.

          He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
          where he can’t reach it.

                         JACK
               C’mon.

                         KATE
               Sorry, Jack.  It’s too 
               important to me.

          They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

          He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
          chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
          laughing...

          Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
          house... just about the catch up to her when...

          She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
          her...

                         JACK
               I want that cake!

          ...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
          playfully on top of him...

                         KATE
                    (laughing)
               You want the cake!?

                         JACK
                    (out of breath)
               I want it...

          She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
          hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

          Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Thank you...

                         KATE
               It’s good, right?

          He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
          mouth.

          They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
          each other cake, laughing.

          Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kate’s 
          face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
          realizes...

          ...he hasn’t laughed like this in thirteen years.  
          Then...

                         JACK
               Are the kids asleep?

          A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
          passionately right there on the steps...it’s heating 
          up...

                         KATE
                    (caught up in the 
                     moment)
               Say it, Jack...

                         JACK
               What...?

                         KATE
               C’mon, you know what I 
               like to hear...

                         JACK
                    (in the throes 
                     of passion)
               Yeah, baby, I know what 
               you like to hear...

                         KATE
                    (kissing him)
               Then say it...just say it 
               to me...!

                         JACK
                    (swept up in the 
                     moment)
               Oh yeah, you’re a bad 
               girl, baby... You make me 
               so hot...I’m gonna take 
               you to that special 
               place...

          Kate pulls away.

                         KATE
               What...?

          Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
          passion drain from her face...

                         JACK
               Not it...?

                         KATE
               Nice, Jack.  You’re 
               sweeping me off my feet.

                         JACK
               What? You make me hot...

          She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
          the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
          he feels something licking at his hand...

          He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
          wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an “I’ve 
          gotta go” look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
          then...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               C’mon, Lucy, maybe one of 
               us can get a little 
               relief tonight...

          He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
          familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

          ...the name “THOMPSON” etched on the mailbox...

          It’s the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
          decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
          curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

          Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
          house...

          He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
          outline of a woman reading by the window...

          EVELYN THOMPSON...

          Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
          nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

          He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
          doorbell...but it’s a tentative move...he keeps it 
          there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
          reason he can’t bring himself to push it...

          He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
          the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

                         JACK
                    (pulling the leash)
               C’mon, girl, let’s go 
               home...

    71     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

          The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
          leash, his face red from the cold outside.

          He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
          coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

          He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
          rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

          CHAPTER ELEVEN – HOME MOVIES

          He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
          scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

          He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
          family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
          on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
          expressions...

          He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
          marked with titles like, “Trip to Yosemite, ‘96" and 
          “Josh’s 1st Birthday.”  He runs his fingers along the 
          tapes, stopping at one marked, “Jack Singing.”  His 
          eyes linger there a moment...

          He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

          ON TV:

          It’s a party for Kate’s birthday thrown at the Kramers’ 
          house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
          cheesy “Happy Birthday” decorations.

          The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

          Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
          music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

                         ARNIE (O.S.)
               Jesus, Bill, this thing 
               is an antique.  Don’t you 
               even have image 
               stabilization?

          Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

                         BILL KRAMER
               Four hundred bucks at Best 
               Buy, Arn.

          Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
          face.

                         JACK
               And everyone knows image 
               stabilization is for the 
               weak...

          Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

          Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
          putting an arm around Jack...

                         ARNIE
               So Jack, it’s your wife’s 
               birthday, got anything to 
               say to her?

                         JACK
                    (to Kate)
               It’s your birthday?  
               Today?  What’s your 
               name?  Where were you 
               born?

                         KATE
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Wait a minute.  You’re my 
               wife?

          She slaps him playfully on the arm...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I do have one thing I 
               wanna say...

          Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

                         JACK (CONT”D)
                    (singing to her)
               Oh those fingers in my 
               hair, that sly come 
               hither stare, strips my 
               conscience bare, it’s 
               witchcraft... 

          Jack doesn’t have the greatest voice in the world but 
          he’s not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
          to like it, there’s a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
          guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

          Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...and I’ve got no 
               defense for it, that heat 
               is too intense for it, 
               what good would common 
               sense for it do...

          Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
          basic chords for “Witchcract,” sounding it out as he 
          goes along...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...‘Cause it’s 
               witchcraft, wicked 
               witchcraft...and although 
               I know it’s strictly 
               taboo...when you rouse 
               the need in me, my heart 
               says yes indeed in me, 
               proceed with what you’re 
               leadin’ me to...

          The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
          crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
          in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the men’s faces 
          as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

          A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
          jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
          captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

          Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
          of the gathered guests... 

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               It’s such an ancient 
               pitch, but one that I’d 
               never switch, there ain’t 
               no nicer witch than 
               you...

          Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But it’s no 
          longer embarrassment on his face, it’s fascination...

          Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
          watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
          Kate...Evelyn can’t take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
          and walks toward the kitchen...

          Jack raises an eyebrow...

          In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldn’t have 
          a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
          verse...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ‘Cause it’s witchcraft, 
               that koo koo 
               witchcraft...and although 
               I know it’s strictly 
               taboo...

          The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
          getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
          unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
          along with Jack, almost as if he’s studying him, 
          revering him...

          Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
          underestimated his alter ego...

          On the video...Jack staring into Kate’s eyes...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...when you rouse the 
               need in me, my heart says 
               yes indeed to me, proceed 
               with what you’re leadin’ 
               me to...

          Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               It’s such an ancient 
               pitch, but one that I’d 
               never switch...

          Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
          the crowd.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ‘Cause there’s no nicer 
               witch than you...

          Kate brushes a hand across Jack’s face...

          Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
          connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

          Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
          completely in the palm of Jack’s hand...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...than you...

          The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
          builds to a crescendo...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...than you...

          A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
          out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

          Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
          the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

          Back on video...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (speaking quietly 
                     to Kate)
               Happy Birthday 
               sweetheart...I love you.

          Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
          AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
          own little world...

          Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
          fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

          A tear at the corner of his eye...

          The SOUND fades in Jack’s head as the action in the 
          video continues...

          He’s left standing there...silent, still...

          DISSOLVE TO:

    72     INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          Lucy licking Jack’s face.  Jack pushes the dog 
          away...as...

          The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

                         KATE
                    (groggy)
               Time to get up, honey...

          Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
          putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
          practically half-asleep.

    73     INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

          Jack walks into the kitchen.

          He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
          fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
          heads upstairs.

    74     INT. JOSH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...into Josh’s room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
          in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

          Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
          and then walks out of the room...

          CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
          the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
          smile on her face.

          Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
          behind, as if to ask whether it’s for him, then back to 
          Kate.

                         KATE
               Happy Anniversary, 
               honey...

          Terror on Jack’s face.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (pushing the gift 
                     forward)
               Before you do whatever 
               crazy stunt you’ve got 
               planned I want you to 
               open mine...

          Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

                         JACK
               Maybe I should wait...

                         KATE
               No, open it...

          He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
          revealing...

          ...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
          suit...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I found it at an outlet 
               store.  I know it’s a 
               knock-off, but I think 
               it’ll look great on 
               you...

                         JACK
                    (examining the label)
               Zeena...

          Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, it’s a ZEENA, but 
          this is probably the nicest thing anyone’s ever done 
          for him...

                         JACK (CONT’D) 
                    (tearing up)
               You really are 
               incredible...

                         KATE
               Enjoy it, sweetheart...

          Jack looks at Kate’s expectant face, suddenly 
          remembering how truly screwed he is.

                         JACK
               You’re probably expecting 
               something from me...

          He’s sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
          look on her face...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Here’s the thing.  I 
               really hadn’t planned on 
               giving you your...uh... 
               anniversary gift until 
               tonight.
                    (an uncomfortable 
                     smile)
               You know, anniversary’s 
               good all day...

                         KATE
               What are you talking 
               about?  You never wait 
               all day.  You can barely 
               wait until it’s light 
               out.

                         JACK
               I know that, but...

          Beat.  Kate looks at him like she’s looking into his 
          soul.

                         KATE
               You forgot.

          Jack stands there, silent.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               You actually forgot our 
               anniversary.

                         JACK
               I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out 
               right now and get you 
               something.  I’ll make it 
               right.

          That didn’t help.

                         KATE
                    (holding back 
                     the tears)
               Jesus, Jack...Is this 
               where we are now?  Is 
               this our marriage?  
               Suddenly I’m the wife who 
               has to drop hints two 
               weeks before her 
               anniversary so her 
               husband doesn’t fuck it 
               up?

          Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
          his...

                         JACK
               Please don’t cry...

          Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

                         KATE
                    (shaking her head, 
                     crying)
               I don’t want to be that, 
               Jack...

          Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
          it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

          Jack is left standing alone, holding Kate’s gift...

          CUT TO:

    76     INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

          Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
          for some air...

          He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
          pity on his face.

          He notices Annie’s bike leaning against the side of the 
          porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
          handle bar.

          He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
          RING ...he looks around, as if he’s expecting someone 
          to appear ...but there’s no one.  He RINGS the bell 
          again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
          someone’s attention.

                         JACK
               C’mon...c’mon...

          Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
          RINGING the bell with everything he’s got...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (shouting to the 
                     sky)
               C’mon, goddamnit, how was 
               I supposed to know the 
               date of their 
               anniversary!?  I never 
               married her!

          Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

                         ANNIE
                    (slowly)
               Put the bicycle back on 
               the ground...

          Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
          folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
          the glass to her.

          She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
          milk mustache on her lip.

                         ANNIE
               Not bad...I shoulda 
               warned you.  Dad always 
               does something really 
               special for their 
               anniversary.

                         JACK
               Like what?

                         ANNIE
               One year he had a solar 
               system named after her...

                         JACK
               Don’t you think that’s a 
               little gimmicky?

                         ANNIE
               Mom liked it.

          Jack raises an eyebrow.

                         JACK
               Maybe there’s a jewelry 
               store back at the mall.  
               I could get her a pair of 
               earrings or something.

                         ANNIE
               That’s good but...you did 
               forget the anniversary.

                         JACK
               Right.  That’s a major 
               oversight...
                    (thinking aloud)
               So if I’m Kate...I can’t 
               really afford the finer 
               things, my husband’s 
               career is a crushing 
               disappointment to me, 
               I’m trapped in suburbia...

          Then...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Did he ever take her to 
               the City?

          Annie smiles, impressed.

                         ANNIE
               You’re really gettin’ the 
               hang of this.

          Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jack’s face.  
          For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78     INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
          dressed.

          Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
          carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
          little black one.

          Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

                         KATE
               Which do you think?

          Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
          seriously...

                         ANNIE
               The black one...

          Kate nods.  She’s about to put it on when she looks at 
          Annie...

                         KATE
               Fighting’s a part of it, 
               Annie.  You know that, 
               right?

                         ANNIE
               I’m not worried, Mom.  
               He’s still learning our 
               ways...

          Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
          It’s true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
          hand to Annie.

                         KATE
               C’mere.

          Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
          lipstick...

                         ANNIE
                    (excited)
               Really?

          Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annie’s 
          lips.

                         KATE
               Now go like this...

          Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
          it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her – 
          Annie’s beaming.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               You’re gonna break a lot 
               of hearts, you know.

          A smile from Annie...

          Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
          watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80     EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

          A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
          lined lower Manhattan street.

    81     INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

          Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  It’s not a 
          Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

          He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
          restaurant...

          He helps her off with her coat.  Kate’s wearing the 
          sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
          effectiveness...

                         JACK
               You look beautiful...

          A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

          Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (instinctively)
               Thanks, Catherine...

          Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
          him a pat on the back...

                         KATE
               You okay?

          He takes Kate by the arm...

                         JACK
               Fine...

          He leads her to the main room.

          She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
          country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

                         KATE
                    (quietly to Jack)
               Jack...can we afford all 
               this?

                         JACK
               What’s the difference?  
               I’m taking my baby out 
               for our anniversary, damn 
               the costs...

                         KATE
               How do you even know 
               about this place?

          Jack’s caught for a moment.  Then...

                         JACK
               Arnie...
                    (insistent)
               Arnie.  He’ll throw you a 
               curve ball once in a 
               while, that’s for sure...

          Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
          cheek...

    82     INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

          Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
          standing next to them.  Jack’s not even looking at the menu.

                         JACK
               We’ll have the tureen of 
               quail breast with 
               shiitake mushrooms to 
               start, then the veal 
               medallions in raspberry 
               truffle sauce and the sea 
               scallops with pureed 
               artichoke hearts...sea 
               scallops, North of the 
               Caspian...

          Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
          her face.

                         WAITER
               Very good, sir.  And may 
               I say those are all 
               excellent selections.

                         JACK
               You may...
                    (perusing the 
                     wine list)
               Also, we’ll have a bottle 
               of Lafite, 1982.

          Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
          it upside down.

                         KATE
               It’s five hundred and 
               fifty dollars, Jack!

          A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
          perfect.

                         JACK
               Just a glass of red wine 
               for each of us...

          The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

                         KATE
               You are so not off the 
               hook yet, slick.

                         JACK
               But I’m gettin’ close, right?

          A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
          look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You want to dance?

          A puzzled look from Kate.  There’s nobody else 
          dancing.  There isn’t even much room to dance...

                         KATE
               I don’t think there’s 
               dancing here, Jack.

          Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

                         JACK
               Sure there is...

          Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

          Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
          arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
          confident and self-assured.

          The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
          in this romantic moment.

          Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
          They look good together...in sync with each other...

          People are watching them...some of the men are 
          impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
          clearly charmed...

                         KATE
                    (whispering to 
                     Jack)
               Pretty good for a tire 
               salesman from Jersey...

          Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

                         JACK
               I have my moments...

          They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83     INT. LOIRE - LATE

          Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
          Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
          She takes a bite.

                         KATE
               Mmmm...
                    (spearing a scallop)
               ...here, try one of 
               these...

          Jack takes a scallop from Kate’s fork.

                         JACK
                    (savoring the scallop) 
               God I missed that 
               taste...

          Kate laughs.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Why are you laughing?

          Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
          at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
          fork.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I need to tell you 
               something.

                         KATE
               Okay...

                         JACK
               I think it may help us 
               but there’s a slight 
               chance it could make 
               things worse.

          She hears the seriousness in his voice.

                         KATE
               Now I’m worried...just 
               say it.  Whatever it is 
               we’ll deal with it.

                         JACK
               Are you sure?

          She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
          Then...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I feel like I’m living 
               someone else’s life...

          Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
          nods reassuringly.  He continues...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I used to be so sure 
               about everything, you 
               know?  I knew exactly who 
               I was and what I wanted.  
               Then one morning I woke 
               up and suddenly it was 
               all different...

                         KATE
               Worse, you mean...

                         JACK
               No.  Well, maybe a few 
               things.  But mostly just 
               different...

          Jack lets out a small smile.  Now he’s the one who’s 
          reassuring Kate.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I never used to be like 
               this, Kate.  I had it all 
               figured out.  No doubts, 
               no regrets.

                         KATE
               And now...?

                         JACK
               Now...I don’t...

          He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
          desperate for understanding.

                         KATE
               Me neither.

          A raised eyebrow from Jack.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I think it’s good to be a 
               little unsure about who 
               you are.  It’s very 
               human.

                         JACK
               But you always seem so 
               certain.

                         KATE
               C’mon, Jack, you think 
               there aren’t mornings 
               when I wake up and wonder 
               what the hell I’m doing 
               in New Jersey...

                         JACK
               That’s a big one for me, 
               too.

                         KATE
               My office is a dump, I 
               answer my own phone...and 
               you’ve seen my pay check.

                         JACK
               Your pay check is a 
               disgrace to pay checks.

                         KATE
               I mean yes, I help people 
               that need it...

                         JACK
               I guess...some of them 
               are probably faking.

                         KATE
                    (a laugh, then...)
               God, sometimes I think it 
               would be so nice not to 
               have to stretch ground 
               beef or maybe drive a car 
               with a CD player...

          He smiles, right there with her.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Imagine having a life 
               where everything was 
               easy...where you asked 
               for things and people 
               just brought them to 
               you...

                         JACK
               It’s wonderful...

          Kate laughs, nodding.

          A pause, then...

                         KATE
               I think about it, too, 
               Jack.  I do.  I think 
               about the kind of person 
               I’d be if I hadn’t 
               married you...

          It’s as if she’s inside his head.  They stay like this 
          for a moment, looking into each other.

                         JACK
               And...?

          She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

                         KATE
               And I realize I’ve just 
               erased the things in my 
               life I’m most sure 
               about.  You, the kids...

          Jack nods.

                         JACK
               Good things...

                         KATE
               What are you sure about?

          Jack looks into Kate’s eyes.

                         JACK
               I’m sure that right now 
               there’s nowhere I’d 
               rather be than here with 
               you...

          Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  It’s been 
          a while.

          CUT TO:

    84     EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

          The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
          the square.  It’s like something out of a Henry James 
          novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85     INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

          The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
          enters...

          Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
          furniture...it’s like walking into another world...

                         KATE
               This is so beautiful...

          Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
          silver ice bucket...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               You know champagne makes 
               me do crazy things.

                         JACK
                    (pouring)
               I’ll just full yours up 
               to the top.
                    (handing her a 
                     glass)
               Happy anniversary, 
               sweetheart.

          Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jack’s.

                         KATE
               I don’t know how you did 
               it, hoss, but you pulled 
               it off.

                         JACK
               I’m out of the doghouse?

                         KATE
               Way out...

          Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
          size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
          her...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (turning to him)
               You may even get lucky 
               tonight...

          Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
          the powerful effect it has on him.

          Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
          in her.

                         JACK
               You’re so...beautiful...

                         KATE
               I already told you you 
               were gonna get lucky, 
               Jack...

          They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

          Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

                         JACK
               My god, all this time...I 
               never stopped loving 
               you...

                         KATE
                    (a wide smile) 
               That’s all I wanted to 
               hear...

          She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
          caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
          behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

          DISSOLVE TO:

    86     INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

          Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

          Kate, in Jack’s arms, her head on his chest, a 
          contented smile on her face...

          Jack’s eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
          at Kate.

          There’s something different in his eyes...something 
          deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, “I’m in love” kind of 
          smile.

          Kate stirs, gently stroking Jack’s chest.

                         KATE
               Mmmm...Jack...

          Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I feel like I should give 
               you money...

          Jack laughs.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I mean, my god, Jack you 
               were always good but 
               this...this was... like a 
               porno movie.

          Kate lays her head back on Jack’s chest, looking at 
          Washington Square through the window.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I could stay here 
               forever...

                         JACK
               I don’t think I’d fight 
               you on that one...

          Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
          kiss.

    87     EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

          The mini-van passes a sign that reads, “Welcome to 
          Teaneck.”

    88     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

          Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
          practicing her violin...it’s a noise bordering on 
          MUSIC, but not quite...

          She walks into the kitchen where...

          Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
          Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

          He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
          strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
          goes back to his paper.

    89     INT. JACK’S CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

          Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
          sleeve oxford...

   89A     EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

          The front door of the Campbell House...

          Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
          a bagel in his mouth...

          He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
          slowly behind him...

          In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
          in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
          heads to the car.

          Then...a smile from Kate...

          In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
          into Kate’s arms...

          ...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
          post...

                         KATE
               Have a good day...

          A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
          him on his way...

    90     EXT. BIG ED’S - AFTERNOON

          Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
          a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
          of high top Nike Air Jordans.

                         JACK
               For the money, they’re 
               hands down the best 
               radial we carry...

                         MAN
                    (thinking, then...)
               Okay, I’ll take them...

                         JACK
               You won’t regret it...
                    (shouting to Tommy)
               Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
               with four B.F. Goodrich 
               G-Force T/A’s...
                    (looking the man 
                     over)
               ...and give him ten 
               percent off for having 
               the best costume...

          Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
          the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

                         ESTELLE (O.S.)
                    (over P.A. system)
               Jack, Kate on line two!  
               Jack pick up two!

          Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
          back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

          Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

                         KENNY
                    (walking out to Jack)
               Kate’s on two, Jack.
                    (on seeing the Rolls)
               Nice ride...

                         JACK
                    (staring at Lassiter)
               If you’re into that kind 
               of conspicuous 
               consumption...

                         KENNY
               You want me to handle 
               him?  I think I’m 
               ready...

                         ESTELLE (O.S.)
                    (over P.A. system)
               Jack!  Kate still holding 
               on line two...

                         JACK
               Sure...be careful, he 
               looks like a tough 
               negotiator...

          Jack walks inside...

    91     INT. BIG ED’S TIRES - CONTINUOUS

          ...but he’s still focused on Lassiter through the 
          window, can’t take his eyes off him...

          He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
          blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
          Lassiter...

          ...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
          phone...

          But can’t bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
          Then...

                         JACK
                    (to Estelle, into 
                     intercom)
               Tell Kate I’ll call her 
               back...

          INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

                         ESTELLE 
                    (into intercom)
               It sounded pretty 
               important.

                         JACK
                    (into intercom)
               I’m with a customer.  
               I’ll call her back.

          He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
          outside the store...

          CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92     EXT. BIG ED’S TIRES - CONTINUOUS

          ...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

                         LASSITER
                    (to Kenny)
               I seem to have had some 
               kind of blow out...

          Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

                         JACK
               Why don’t you let me take 
               this one, Kenny?

                         KENNY
               Okay, chief.

          Kenny nods then heads back inside...

                         JACK
               Peter Lassiter...

                         LASSITER
                    (surprised)
               Do I know you?

                         JACK
               Not exactly. I’ve seen you 
               on CNBC.
                    (with a smile)
               You look taller in real 
               life...

    93     INT. BIG ED’S TIRED, JACK’S OFFICE - LATE

          Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
          cluttered, cramped office.

                         JACK
               ...truth is, Mintz was so 
               busy timing his wife’s 
               breathing he didn’t see 
               that MedTech needed 
               Global more than the 
               other way around.  Ten 
               days, two weeks tops, 
               they would’ve approached 
               you with an offer, and 
               I’d bet anything it 
               would’ve been thirty 
               billion, not twenty 
               nine...
                    (a knowing smile)
               Problem was, Peter, you 
               had a pussycat running 
               the show. What you needed 
               was a rottweiler.

          Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
          an intrigued look on his face...

                         LASSITER
                    (nodding)
               Well, I’m impressed.

          A smile from Jack.

                         LASSITER (CONT’D)
               I really am...

          Jack savors the moment, until...

                         LASSITER (CONT’D)
               So, about my car...

          He’s jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

                         JACK
               Sure. We’re going to 
               have to special order 
               that tire. It’ll be 
               ready in about two days.

          Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
          wallet.

                         LASSITER
               This has my office address 
               on it...
                    (thinking, then...)
               Why don’t you drop it off 
               yourself?

          A smile from Jack.

    94     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JACK’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Kate, sound asleep in bed...

          Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in 
          thought...

    95     INT. BIG ED’S, JACK’S OFFICE - DAY

          Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
          distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
          GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

                         HECTOR
               ...I say to her, Margarita, 
               we already have four kids, 
               why do we need more?

          Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
          eyes the door...
                         
                         HECTOR (CONT’D)
               But she say she want an 
               even number. I say four 
               is an even number! But 
               she say she want six.

          Jack checks his watch...

                         HECTOR (CONT’D)
               I tell her, Margarita, I 
               just got my green card, 
               I like to sit back and 
               rest a little bit...

                         JACK
                    (interrupting)
               Hector...do I usually 
               listen to your personal 
               problems?

                         HECTOR 
               Sure, Jack, all the time...

          Jack nods, then...

                         JACK
               Look, I have some business 
               that I have to take care 
               of in the city so I’m 
               leaving early...
                    (getting up)
               My advice to you...follow 
               your dreams.

          CUT TO:

    96     EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

          Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiter’s Rolls...

          He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
          good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
          skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
          inside...

    96A     INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
          SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like he’s 
          crazy...

    97     INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

          Jack and Lassiter walk together...

                         LASSITER
               ...we’re really more of a 
               boutique operation, as 
               you can see...

                         JACK
               But you’re not interested 
               in boutique dollars...
                    (a smile)
               I get it...

          They walk into...

    98     INT. ALAN MINTZ’S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Past the assistant’s desk...

                         MINTZ’S ASSISTANT
                    (seeing Lassiter)
               He’s expecting you, Mr. 
               Lassiter...

          Lassiter doesn’t even slow down...

    99     INT. ALAN MINTZ’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          It’s Jack’s old office but you wouldn’t know it from 
          the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
          play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
          immediately struck by the difference...

                         LASSITER
                    (to Mintz)
               Alan, this is Jack 
               Campbell...the one I was 
               telling you about...

          Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
          desk and goes to shake Jack’s hand.

                         ALAN
               Jack, of course.

          They shake hands.

                         JACK
                    (appropriately 
                     deferential)
               Mr. Mintz.

                         ALAN
               Please, call me Alan. We 
               try to cultivate a casual 
               atmosphere around here...

                         JACK
                    (re: play pen)
               I can see that, Alan.

          A chuckle from Mintz.

                         ALAN
               You have kids, Jack?

                         JACK
                    (hesitating, then...)
               Uh...actually, yes. Two...
               good ones.

          Another laugh from Mintz.

                         ALAN
               That’s great...
                    (gesturing to 
                     the sofa)
               Why don’t you have a seat?

          Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
          Lassiter take the chairs.

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               So, Peter mentioned that 
               you were an avid CNBC 
               watcher but didn’t say 
               whether you had any 
               actual Wall Street 
               experience?

          Jack’s a little taken aback by the question, not 
          realizing he was walking into an interview...

          He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

                         JACK
               I was a sales associate, 
               at E.F. Hutton.

                         ALAN
               A broker? Really. And now 
               you’re in the tire 
               business?

                         JACK
               That’s right. And auto 
               supply...

                         ALAN
               Uh huh. The retail end, I 
               understand.

          Jack nods...

                         JACK
               Uh...we actually get about 
               sixty percent of our 
               business from automotive 
               service.

                         ALAN
               Mind if I ask what kind of 
               sales you did last year? 
               Ballpark...

                         JACK
               We did one point seven 
               million in total revenue...

                         ALAN
               Uh huh...one point seven.  
               And what do you project for 
               this year?

          Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
          questions, the smirk on Mintz’s face...


                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               Any thoughts at all on 
               that?

          As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
          of his handicap...

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               Jack?

          He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
          then ...a confident smile.

                         JACK
               Well, Alan, I think we’re 
               gonna have a banner year.  
               Sales are up almost 
               twenty percent in the 
               first quarter and we just 
               landed a major trucking 
               company account.

                         ALAN
               Really. So you’re 
               projecting what, a tad 
               over two million?

          A gleam in Jack’s eye.

                         JACK
               That’s right. And that 
               would make us number one 
               in our market...
                    (getting up)
               You mind if I stand?

          A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

          Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
          crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
          water...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Look, I know our paltry 
               little two million in 
               sales is about what you 
               spend on office supplies 
               in a year.  And I know 
               some regional trucking 
               company account is 
               nothing compared to a 
               sixty billion dollar 
               merger...

                         ALAN
               I’m not trying to knock 
               the tire business, Jack.

                         JACK
                    (a confident chuckle)
               It’s okay, Alan. I get it. 
               I’m in your shoes, I’m 
               thinking exactly the same 
               thing...but here’s the 
               thing. Business is 
               business.  Wall Street, 
               Main Street, it’s all 
               just a bunch of people 
               getting up in the morning, 
               trying to figure out how 
               the hell they’re gonna 
               send their kids to 
               college.  It’s just 
               people...

          Jack’s confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
          appears intrigued...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And I know people.

                         ALAN
               I’m sure you do...

                         LASSITER
                    (intervening)
               Let’s let the man have 
               his say...

          Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

                         JACK
                    (to Mintz)
               Take you, for instance...

                         ALAN
                    (defensive)
               What about me?

                         JACK
               You drink about sixteen 
               Diet Cokes a day. You’re 
               an excellent father, but 
               you feel guilty about the 
               time you spend away from 
               home. You drink bourbon, 
               but you offer your 
               clients scotch...

          Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And your wife decorated 
               this office...

          A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
          caught look on his face.

                         LASSITER
               He certainly has your 
               number, Alan.

                         JACK
                    (turning to Lassiter)
               You’re a little tougher, 
               Peter.

          A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but he’s game...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               For one thing, you like 
               expensive things.

                         LASSITER
                    (smiling proudly) 
               That’s easy. You’ve seen 
               my car.

                         JACK
                    (a chuckle)
               Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
               Monterreys. You’re a 
               scotch man, single malt, 
               not because it’s trendy 
               but because you’ve been 
               doing it for forty years, 
               and you stay with what 
               works. You have two great 
               loves in your life, your 
               horses and this company.  
               You wept openly the day 
               the Dow hit ten thousand...

          Lassiter’s impressed.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And you’re a man who 
               prides himself on finding 
               talent in unusual 
               places...


                         LASSITER
               Oh? And how would you 
                              know that?

          Jack smiles.

                         JACK
               Because I’m here.

          On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
          smile.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I’m prepared to do 
               anything it takes to get 
               this job. Start anywhere 
               you need me to start.  
               I’ll park cars if I 
               to...
                    (into Lassiter’s 
                     eyes)
               The biggest part of 
               judging character is 
               knowing yourself. And I 
               know this, I can do this 
               job. Give me a chance, 
               Peter, I won’t let you 
               down.

          Lassiter returns Jack’s gaze with equal intensity. In a 
          moment, he turns to Mintz.

                         LASSITER
                    (to Mintz)
               Alan, why don’t you show 
               Jack around a bit...

                         ALAN
               I’d love to.

          CUT TO:

    100     INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

          Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
          EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
          back...

                         ALAN
                    (pointing)
               ...that’s our war room.  
               We did seven major deals 
               last year, three of them 
               hostile.

                         JACK
                    (not particularly 
                     impressed)
               Seven.  Really.

          They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
          the corridor.

          Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintz’s 
          gaze with a quizzical look.

                         ALAN
               Let’s cut the shit, huh 
               Campbell? What, did you go 
               through his wallet or 
               something?

          Jack’s a little taken aback.

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               No matter. That circus 
               act back there may have 
               dazzled Lassiter 
               momentarily but it 
               doesn’t do shit forme.  
               Even if you get this job, 
               which I highly doubt, let 
               me warn you, Lassiter 
               loses interest in his pet 
               projects very quickly. 
               I’m in the big office 
               because I’ve proved 
               myself to him year after 
               year and nobody is going 
               to come in here and start 
               turning the old man’s 
               head. Especially not some 
               tire salesman from New 
               Jersey. So you watch 
               yourself and stay away 
               from Lassiter, and maybe, 
               just maybe, I’ll keep you 
               on after he gets tired of 
               you. Do we understand 
               each other?

          Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
          expressionless.

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               Do we?!

          Then, a broad smile from Jack.

                         JACK
               God, you really are 
               different, aren’t you...
                    (nodding)
               I mean...wow...I am 
               impressed.

          Now it’s Mintz’s turn to look quizzical.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Good for you. Why shouldn’t 
               you protect what’s yours.

                         ALAN
               I don’t think you’re hearing 
               me.

                         JACK
               Oh, I’m hearing you, Alan.  
               That’s not the problem.  
               The problem is that what 
               you think is yours, is 
               really mine.  And I don’t 
               care how low on the totem 
               pole I start, I will get 
               it back...
                    (poking him in 
                     the chest)
               So do yourself a favor and 
               don’t get too attached to 
               that view because sometime 
               soon, maybe very soon, you
               and your French country 
               antiques, your chintz sofa, 
               and your little play pen 
               are gonna be moving out of 
               that office.

          Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Oh, and by the way, you 
               try selling tires for a 
               living.  I promise you, 
               you’d starve.

          Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
          leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

          CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

          CUT TO:

    101     INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

          A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
          duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

                         JACK
               Welcome to Xanadu...

          The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
          lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
          it’s striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
          house.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Pretty incredible, isn’t 
               it?

                         KATE
               It’s like a museum.

          Jack nods.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (turning to Jack)
               So what’s the big 
               surprise? You didn’t 
               rent this place for 
               the weekend, did you?

                         JACK
               Think bigger.

                         KATE
               For the week?

          Jack chuckles.

                         JACK
               This place is a perk, 
               Kate.

                         KATE
               A perk for what?

                         JACK
               A company called P.K. 
               Lassiter and Associates 
               Investment House uses it 
               to attract new 
               executives...

          Kate’s confused.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You’re talking to their 
               new Vice President of 
               Mergers and Acquisitions.

                         KATE
               What are you talking 
               about, Jack?


                         JACK
               I’m going into arbitrage, 
               honey.  Turns out I have 
               a knack for it.  I’ll be 
               making two hundred grand 
               a year plus a hefty bonus
               and that’s just to 
               start.  And, we can live 
               in this apartment 
               practically rent free for 
               as long as we want.

          Jack measures her reaction. It’s not good...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               We can finally afford to 
               move back into the city.  
               In style.

          Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

                         KATE
               Are you out of your mind?

                         JACK
               I don’t think so. This 
               is going to be a better 
               life for all of us, 
               honey.  We’ll put Annie 
               and Josh in private 
               schools...

                         KATE
               Annie goes to a great 
               school.

                         JACK
               I’m talking about the 
               best schools in the 
               country here, Kate...

                         KATE
               Jack, what could you 
               possibly be thinking?  
               What about my job?

                         JACK
               This is New York City, 
               it’s like the needy 
               people capital of the 
               world.  Those Jersey 
               clients of yours aren’t a 
               tenth as pathetic as the 
               ones you could get 
               here...

                         KATE
                    (cutting him off)
               I can’t believe you want 
               to move back into the 
               city.  I thought the 
               reason we left was 
               because we didn’t want to 
               raise the kids here?

                         JACK
               No, this is the center of 
               the universe.  If I were 
               living in Roman times, I 
               would live in Rome, where 
               else?  Today, America is 
               the Roman Empire and New 
               York is Rome itself. 
               John Lennon.

                         KATE
                    (cutting him off) 
               Jack.

          Jack’s starting to struggle...

                         JACK
               Look, I’m detecting a 
               kind of funky tension 
               here...We don’t have to 
               live in this apartment. 
               I don’t need this...I’ll 
               commute...I’ll drive to 
               work...

          Jack’s back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
          apart...

                         KATE
               In traffic?  It’s over an 
               hour each way?  That’s 
               almost three hours a 
               day.  When are you going 
               to see the kids?

          He’s frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
          himself. Then...

                         JACK
               Kate. You’re not 
               understanding me. I’m 
               talking about a great 
               life.  A perfect life.  
               Everything we pictured 
               when we were young. The 
               whole package. You said 
               it yourself, life has 
               thrown us surprises, and 
               so we made sacrifices.  
               But now I can finally get 
               us back on track...

          A sad chuckle from Kate.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I can do that.  I want to 
               do that.  For all of us.  
               I need to do that as a 
               man...
                    (imploring her)
               Think about it.  No more 
               lousy restaurants, no 
               more clipping coupons, no 
               more shoveling snow...

                         KATE
               Then get a goddamn snow 
               blower!

          Jack’s taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Don’t get a new career 
               without even telling me.  
               Don’t take Annie out of a 
               school she loves.  Don’t 
               move us out of a house 
               we’ve become a family 
               in...

          Kate stands there, wounded...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (quietly)
               Don’t do that...

                         JACK
               Look, you’re making this 
               into something it’s not. 
               This isn’t a referendum 
               on our lives, Kate. It’s 
               a step forward...
                    (appealing to her)
               Don’t you see?  I’m 
               talking about us finally 
               having a life other 
               people envy.

          Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye – a deep, piercing 
          look...

                         KATE
               They already do envy us, 
               Jack...

          Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    102  OMITTED

    103     INT. ANNIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

          Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
          walks in.

          It’s all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
          notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

                         JACK
               Very nice. What is it?

                         ANNIE
               Mary Had A Little Lamb.

                         JACK
               Ah. A classic...

          Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
          dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
          down its sides...

          Jack studies them...in every one Jack’s face is totally 
          contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

          Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

          Jack turns to her.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Please don’t stop...

          She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
          to the pictures...

    104     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

          Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

          He looks at Lassiter’s business card, sitting on the 
          surface of the desk...

          He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
          bookshelf...a book...

          He moves toward it...looking at its spine...it’s a 
          tattered copy of Vonnegut’s “Cat’s Cradle.”  He pulls 
          it off the shelf, there’s something inside...a 
          bookmark...

          ...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

          ...inside...a boarding pass...”From: London/Heathrow, 
          To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.”

          He looks at it...something’s not right...

                         JACK
               From London to New York...?
                    (looking up)
               I came back...

          Then...a NOISE...

          Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
          standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
          ticket sleeve.

                         KATE
               Our finest moment, 
               right...

          A quizzical look from Jack.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               When you got on that 
               plane I was sure it was 
               over.  I left the airport 
               afraid I’d never see you 
               again.  And then you 
               showed up the very next 
               day...
                    (a wistful smile)
               That was a good 
               surprise...

          She continues into the room, leaning against a 
          bookshelf.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I think about you on that 
               plane, about what must 
               have been going through 
               your mind...you sitting 
               there imagining our life 
               together, our life 
               apart...I think about the 
               decision you made...

          Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Maybe I was being naive 
               but I believed we’d grow 
               old together in this 
               house.  That we’d spend 
               holidays here, have g
               randchildren visit us 
               here.  I had this image 
               of us all grey and 
               wrinkly, me working in 
               the garden, you 
               repainting the deck...

          Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Things change, right?  
               People change...
                    (pausing)
               If you need this, Jack, I 
               mean really need this, I 
               will take these children 
               from a life they love, 
               and take myself from the 
               only home we’ve ever 
               shared, and move wherever 
               you need to go.  I’ll do 
               that because I love 
               you...

          The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I love you, Jack. And  
               that’s more important to 
               me than our address...

          Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
          kisses him gently on the forehead.

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I choose us.

          She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
          the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
          her as she goes...

    105     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Jack walks into the room...

          The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

          He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

          Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
          to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
          her, drawing her in...

          In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jack’s embrace.  He 
          savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

          They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
          person.

          DISSOLVE TO:

    106     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

          The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
          her eyes.  Jack’s not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

          Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

          She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
          revealing...

          Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
          snow with Annie and Josh.

          Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
          face...

    107     EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

          ...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
          delight...

          The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

          The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jack’s 
          joy is just as palpable...

          Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
          neck, hugging his tight.

                         ANNIE
                    (whispering in 
                     Jack’s ear)
               I knew you’d come back...

          DISSOLVE TO:

    108     INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

          Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
          until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
          it’s empty...

          And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
          RINGING, echoing through the room.

          A shudder passes through his body...

          He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
          sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

          It’s an eerie moment for Jack...

                         JACK
               What are you doing?

                         ANNIE
                    (a curious look)
               Ringing my bell...

          On Jack’s anxious face...

          CHAPTER FIFTEEN – SAYING GOODBYE

    110     INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

          On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
          convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
          salt...

          He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

                         JACK
               Four ninety nine?! It’s just 
               salt for god’s sake...

          On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
          GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

          She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
          of gum...

          From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
          the counter...

          On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
          salt from the shelf, when...

                         CASH (O.S.)
               That’ll be sixty five cents, 
               little angel...

          Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
          over to the front counter...where he sees...

          Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
          uniform, ringing up the teenager...

          An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

                         JACK
               You...!

          Then...the color drains from Jack’s face...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               What are you doing here...

          Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You’re not sending me 
               back...

          The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
          bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
          to Cash...

                         CASH
               Jack, it’s good to see 
               you...

          Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
          ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

                         CASH (CONT’D)
                    (to the girl)
               Thank you darlin’...

          The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
          given her the wrong change...

                         CASH (CONT’D)
                    (back to Jack, 
                     seeing the
                     rock salt)
               What do you got there, 
               rock salt?  Look at you, 
               all domestic and shit...
               You really figured some 
               things out, huh?

          The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

                         JACK
               I’m not going back...

          The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

                         CASH 
                    (to the girl)
               Everything okay...?

          She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

                         TEENAGE GIRL
               Yeah...fine.

                         JACK
                    (raising his voice)
               Hey! Did you hear me...?!

          Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
          the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

          A look of disappointment on Cash’s face as he reaches 
          into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

          Cash looks at Jack.

                         CASH 
                    (making a note 
                     in his book)

               That was a character issue...
                    (shaking his head)
               ...and for nine dollars?  
               That’s just sad...

                         JACK
               Hey, I’m talking to you!  
               I am not going back, do you 
               understand...?!

          Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You can’t do this. You 
               can’t keep coming in and 
               out of people’s lives, 
               messing things up...

                         CASH
               C’mon, Jack...

          Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

                         JACK
               I’ve got kids, I’m going 
               home...

                         CASH
               You know what the word 
               glimpse means, J? It’s 
               by nature an impermanent 
               thing.

          Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
          turns at the door...

                         JACK
                    (pointing at 
                     Cash)
               I’m staying.

          Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cash’s 
          face as Jack leaves...

    111     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSH’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Jack walks to Josh.  He’s sleeping soundly.

          Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
          wake him.

    112     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIE’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

                         ANNIE
                    (stirring, groggy)
               Is it morning yet?

                         JACK
               No, honey. Go back to 
               sleep.

          She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
          looking at her, sadness all over his face.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Take care of yourself,
               Annie.  I’m going back to 
               the mother ship...

          Finally, he turns to go...

    113     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          The clock reads, “11:17.”  Kate is already in bed as 
          Jack walks in.

                         KATE
                    (looking up from 
                     her book)
               Hey...

          Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

                         JACK
               These last weeks, Kate, I 
               know that I’ve done 
               some...some unusual 
               things.

          Kate nods.

                         KATE
               It’s been interesting, 
               that’s for sure.

                         JACK
               But I’ve done some good 
               things too, haven’t I?

                         KATE
               You’ve been Jack 
               Campbell.  And that’s 
               always a good thing...

          She kisses him on the cheek.

          He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
          eyes.

                         JACK
               I need you to remember 
               me, Kate.  How I am right 
               now, right this very 
               moment.  I need you to 
               put that image in your 
               heart and keep it with 
               you, no matter what 
               happens.

                         KATE
               Are you okay, Jack?

                         JACK
               Please, just promise me 
               you’ll do that. You have 
               to promise, Kate. 
               Because if you don’t, 
               then it’s like it never 
               happened and I don’t 
               think I could live with 
               that.

          She’s a bit confused but she couldn’t be more in love 
          with him.

                         KATE
               I promise, Jack...

                         JACK
               Promise me again...

                         KATE
               I promise. Come to bed, 
               honey.

          Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

                         JACK
               Soon...

    114     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

          Snow begins to fall...

          Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
          mind elsewhere...

          Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
          field...

          Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
          open field.

          Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
          into the field, looking for just the right spot.

          Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
          half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
          his mouth...

          He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
          face. It’s cold, but it’s beautiful...peaceful and 
          still...the air clean and crisp...

          He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
          in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115     INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          The room is dark...

          Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

          He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
          look in his eyes...

          As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
          eyelids appear to grow heavy...

          He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
          focusing on her...but it’s no use...

          Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
          sleep...

          CHAPTER SIXTEEN – THE OLD LIFE

          DISSOLVE TO:

    116     INT. JACK’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

          A PHONE RINGING

          Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
          his face ...he stirs...

          THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

          Jack reaches over to Kate’s side...there’s no one 
          there.

          Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
          his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

          Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...he’s not 
          wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

                         JACK
                    (groggy, dazed)
               Yeah...okay, send her 
               up...

          He drops the phone...turns back over...let’s his eyes 
          stay closed for another moment...then...

          His eyes open...

          He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
          old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (sadly)
               Damnit.

          Jack looks at the clock, “9:23 a.m.”  He gets out of 
          bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
          the room...

    117     INT. JACK’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...Jack walks to the door just as...

          The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
          the door, seeing...

          PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
          face.

                         PAULA
               Waiting for me by the door, 
               huh?

          Jack looks at her.

                         JACK
               Paula...

          Paula opens her coat – the only thing she has on 
          underneath is a sexy little teddy.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (momentarily 
                      distracted)
               That’s totally see through...

                         PAULA
                    (smiling)
               Merry Christmas...

                         JACK
                    (confused)
               Christmas?  It can’t be 
               Christmas...

          Jack stares at her, totally confused...

                         PAULA
                    (lasciviously)
               It’s whatever you want it 
               to be, Jack...

          Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
          shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
          running down the corridor.

                         PAULA (CONT’D)               
               Jack?...Jack!

          CUT TO:

    118     EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

          Jack’s Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119     EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

          Jack’s Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
          out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

          A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
          Jack stares at him in shock.

                         MAN
               Can I help you?

                         JACK
               Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
               here?!

                         MAN
               Kate? No, there’s no one here 
               named Kate.  Is that good 
               enough for you?

          Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
          much to the shock of the guy standing there.

                         JACK
               Damn...damn...damn...

                         MAN
               Hey, are you okay?

                         JACK
               No...I’m not...

                         MAN
               Is there anything I can do 
               for you?

          Jack shakes his head mournfully.

                         MAN (CONT’D)
               Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen.  
               You got a cigarette?

                         JACK
               I’m sorry, no...

          Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120     EXT. ARNIE’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

          Jack’s car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
          to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
          of the driveway.

                         ARNIE
                    (shouting at Jack)
               Hey, you can’t park that 
               thing here.

                         JACK
                    (out the window)
               It’s me, Jack...

                         ARNIE
               I don’t care if you’re Tim 
               Allen with your fancy car 
               and all your tools, you 
               still can’t park here.

                         JACK
               Tell me you recognize me, 
               Arnie.  Please...

                         ARNIE
               How’d you know my name?

                         JACK
               We bowl together. We’re 
               bowlers ...we won a 
               championship...we’re winners.

                         ARNIE
               I never won anything in 
               bowling.

          Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

                         ARNIE (CONT’D)
               Wait a second...
                    (thinking)
               Jack...Jack...

                         JACK
               Yes...Jack Campbell...

                         ARNIE
               Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
               went to high school with
               you...you played baseball, 
               right?
                    (at the Ferrari)
               You’re doing well...

                         JACK
                    (remembering)
               Yes, that’s it...yes, we 
               went to high school together.

                         ARNIE
               You never really talked to 
               me.  I wanted to talk to 
               you, man...

                         JACK
               Yeah...I guess I just 
               wanted you to know, we 
               could’ve been really good 
               friends...

    120A     INT. FERRARI - DAY

          Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

          A curious look on Jack’s face, it’s been a while since 
          he’s heard that sound.

                         JACK
                    (answering phone) 
               Hello?

                         ADELLE (O.S.)
               Hey Santa, where are you?  
               Everybody’s here.

                         JACK
               Adelle?

                         ADELLE (O.S.)
               You were supposed to be here 
               half an hour ago...the 
               emergency strategy session?  
               Your trip to Aspen? They’re 
               all panicked here...

          Silence from Jack...

                         ADELLE (CONT’D, O.S.)
               Jack...? Are you going through 
               the tunnel?

          Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

                         JACK
               I’ll be there in twenty 
               minutes...

          CUT TO:

    121     INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

          It’s a beehive of activity...

          Jack’s TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
          charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

          Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
          a moment to observe the action...

          Mintz spots him...

                         ALAN
                    (into phone)
               Thank god, Jack’s here. I’ll 
               call you right back...

          He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
          Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
                    (approaching)
               Jack, are you okay?

                         JACK
                    (in a daze)
               What’s going on here?

                         ALAN
               It’s not good.  Bob Thomas 
               has secretly been talking to 
               a European drug company.  
               We’re not sure which one, 
               Julia’s on it right now.  
               Word is they’re willing to 
               let him buy a minority stake 
               and keep running the entire 
               company.  The Global people 
               are up in arms.  They say 
               we should’ve been prepared 
               for this.  We’re in trouble 
               here, Jack...

          Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

                         JACK
               You know something, Alan.  
               There’s a much more assertive 
               person somewhere inside of 
               you...

          Alan looks at him, confused.

                         ALAN
               Excuse me?

                         JACK
               But I think I like you better 
               this way...

                         ALAN
               Is this another one of those 
               Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?

          A sad laugh from Jack.

                         JACK
               No.

                         ALAN
               So what are we gonna do, 
               Jack?

          Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

                         ALAN (CONT’D)
               Jack...?           

          Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
          the group...

                         JACK
               I’ll tell you exactly what 
               we’re going to do.  You’re
               going to do whatever you 
               have to do to find out which 
               European company he’s been 
               talking to.  Then I’m going 
               to clean myself up, fly to 
               Aspen, and drink egg nog 
               with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
               and kids will be playing in 
               the background while I spend 
               Christmas day convincing him 
               that the European company is 
               the devil and Global is the 
               answer to his prayers, after 
               all...
                    (growing wistful)
               Then I’m going to spend four 
               hours skiing. Alone. On 
               Christmas day. Completely 
               and utterly alone. I’m going 
               to do that because that is 
               my life, that is what’s 
               real, and there is nothing 
               I can do to change that...

          Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
          team.

    122     EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

          Jack’s limo makes its way downtown.

    123     INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

          Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
          the window, watching the buildings pass by...

          He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
          up...

                         JACK
                    (dialing 411)
               For Manhattan...Kate 
               Reynolds...I need an address 
               too...

          Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
          hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
          window, then turns to the driver...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Make a right here...

                         DRIVER
               But the airport’s the other
               way...

                         JACK
               We’re not going to the 
               airport...

          CUT TO:

          123A     EXT. KATE’S BUILDING - DAY

          Jack’s limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
          Mews...

          Jack gets out...

    124     INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

          Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
          Clash’s “London Calling” BLARING from inside.

          He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
          lower...

          Kate’s assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
          exchanges a curious look with her.

                         LORI
               Are you from the shipping 
               company?

                         JACK
               I’m Jack Campbell...I’m an 
               old... friend of Kate’s.  
               I just called.

          The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

                         LORI (O.S.)
               Kate! Some guy’s here!

          Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

                         KATE (O.S)
                    (to Lori)
               Did you call the airline 
               like I asked?!

          Jack’s eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
          and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
          same.

                         JACK
               Kate...

                         KATE
               Jack...God, it’s been so 
               long...You look...

          She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

                         JACK
               You look great.

                         KATE
               It’s good to see you...

          She looks at him another moment, then turns...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
                    (yelling inside)
               Lori! Where’s that box?!

          Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

          125     INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          ...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
          sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
          SHATTERING it...

                         JACK
                    (bending down)
               I'm sorry...

                         KATE
               Don’t worry about it, Jack...

          Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity – Lori on the 
          phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
          up...

                         JACK
               What’s going on?

                         KATE
                    (searching around)
               I’m moving to Paris...it was 
               right here...
                    (to Lori)
               It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I 
               put it in the stack for the 
               Salvation Army...

                         JACK
               Paris?

                         LORI
                    (to Kate, with 
                     attitude)
               Do you want me to look for 
               the box or call the airline?

                         KATE
               Hey, kind of under a little 
               pressure here.

                         LORI
               Hey, kind of giving up 
               Christmas day for my ex-boss 
               here.

          Jack watches this back and forth.

                         KATE
               You didn’t seem to mind 
               offering to help me on 
               Christmas day when you were 
               unwrapping that Prada bag 
               I gave you.

                         LORI
               Maybe it’s by the wardrobe 
               boxes...

          Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

                         JACK
               You’re moving...

                         KATE
               Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
               has an office there and 
               I’m going to be heading 
               it up.

                         JACK
                    (stunned)
               To Paris. Paris, France.

                         KATE
                    (searching the 
                     boxes)
               That’s the one...

                         JACK
               So you’re not at a non-
               profit firm?

                         KATE
                    (a chuckle)
               Not with what they pay me...

                         JACK
               You’re not married, are 
               you?

                         KATE
               No, Jack, I never got 
               married. You?

                         JACK
               Not exactly...
                    (looking around)
               Can we just take a minute 
               here?  Maybe get a cup of 
               coffee or something...?

                         LORI
                    (yelling)
               I’ll go for a cup of coffee!

                         KATE
               Yes!

          A relieved smile from Jack...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I found it!

                         LORI
               Congratulations. The La 
               Guardia flight’s canceled 
               but I got you out of 
               Kennedy on United at nine.  
               Am I good or what?

          Jack’s smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
          marked, “Jack”...

                         KATE
               Here you go.  It’s just 
               some old things of yours...

          Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

                         JACK
               Do you ever think about us, 
               Kate?  About what might 
               have happened...?

          A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees he’s not 
          laughing...

                         KATE
               You’re serious...

          A nod from Jack...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               I’ll tell you what, Jack, 
               if you’re ever in Paris, 
               look me up. Maybe we’ll 
               go for that cup of coffee.

          One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

          Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
          this isn’t the same woman he knew thirteen years 
          ago, or left yesterday.

                         JACK
               Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

          He leaves...

          CUT TO:

          126     INT. JACK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

          A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song “All Of My Love,” 
          fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmill’s by his 
          side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

          He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
          material, then a “Mondale for President” button, which 
          Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
          ticket stubs...

          He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
          button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
          finding...

          A messy, dog-eared copy of “Cat’s Cradle”...not the one 
          Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

          Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
          then...

          He looks over at the clock, it reads, “8:29.”

          CHAPTER SEVENTEEN – ONE LAST TRY

          CUT TO:

     127     EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

          Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 
          MPH...

          He looks at the clock, it reads, “8:46.” He opens up 
          the throttle...

     128     EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

          Snow is falling as Jack’s car races up to the terminal 
          then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
          sees him...

                         AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
               Hey, you can’t leave that 
               there!

          Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

     129     INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

          Jack looking at the board. The nine o’clock to Paris - 
          Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

     130     INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

          ...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
          Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
          front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
          attendant.

          He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
          annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

                         JACK
                    (calling out)
               Kate!

          Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
          face.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You can’t go!

                         KATE
               Jesus, Jack...

                         JACK
               Don’t get on that plane!

                         KATE
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Please. Let’s just go have 
               a cup of coffee. That’s all 
               I’m asking for. I’m sure 
               there’s another flight to 
               Paris tonight.

                         KATE
               What do you want from me? 
               You want me to tell you 
               everything that happened 
               was okay?

          Jack just stands there, unsure...

                         KATE (CONT’D)
               Well it is. Yes, I was 
               heartbroken ...But I got 
               over it. I moved on. 
               People change, Jack. I 
               changed. I don’t know 
               why you suddenly feel the 
               need to revisit that time 
               in our lives but I assure 
               you, it’s over...

          Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
          there...

          He watches her walk to the podium, realizing she’s 
          right...

          He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
          attendant...

          Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

                         JACK
                    (at Kate)
               We have a house in Jersey!

          Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

                         KATE
               Don’t do this, Jack...
               But he continues...

                         JACK
               We have two kids, Annie and 
               Josh...

          ...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
          interested...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...Annie’s not much of a 
               violin player but she 
               tries really hard. She’s a 
               little precocious but that’s 
               only because she says what’s 
               on her mind. And when she 
               smiles...

          Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
          tears...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And Josh...he has your eyes. 
               He doesn’t say much but we 
               know he’s smart...
                    (lost in the memory)
               ...he’s always got his eyes 
               open, always watching us...
               sometimes you can look at 
               him and just know that he’s 
               learning something new...
               it’s like witnessing a 
               miracle...

          Kate’s expression has sifted from annoyance to 
          curiosity.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...the house is a mess, but 
               it’s ours...
                    (chuckling)
               ...well, after a hundred 
               twenty two more payments 
               it will be...

          Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
          the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And you...you’re a non-
               profit lawyer. That’s right, 
               completely non-profit. But 
               that doesn’t seem to bother 
               you...

          Kate raises an eyebrow. It’s something she’s thought 
          about.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And we’re in love. After 
               thirteen years of marriage 
               we’re still unbelievably 
               in love...
                    (with a chuckle)
               You won’t even let me touch 
               you until I’ve said it...

          Jack gets closer and closer...Kate’s spellbound now... 
          imagining the picture Jack’s painting...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...I sing to you...not all 
               the time but definitely on 
               special occasions...

          Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
          row of passengers...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
                    (off hand, to passenger)
               Excuse me...
                    (to Kate)
               We made a lot of sacrifices, 
               dealt with our share of 
               surprises, but we stayed 
               together...

          Jack’s nearly there...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               You see, you’re a better 
               person than I am...

          Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               ...and it made me a better 
               person to be around you...

          Kate is perfectly still, Jack’s words echoing in her 
          ears.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Maybe it was all a 
               dream. Maybe I went to 
               bed one lonely night in 
               December and imagined it 
               all. But I swear, 
               nothing’s ever felt more 
               real to me...

          He’s right in front of her. She can’t take her eyes 
          off him.

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               And if you get on that 
               plane right now, it’ll 
               disappear forever.

          Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
          world...airport business going on around them...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               I know we can both go on 
               with our lives. And we’d 
               both be fine. But I’ve 
               seen what we can be like 
               together...And I choose 
               us...

          Jack’s words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
          hand to her arm...

                         JACK (CONT’D)
               Please, Kate, one cup of 
               coffee. You can always go 
               to Paris. Just please, not 
               tonight...

          She stands there, frozen, staring into Jack’s eyes, 
          searching for the answer.

                         KATE
               Okay, Jack...

          DISSOLVE TO:

     131     INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

          Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
          airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
          falling outside.

          From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
          a cup of coffee...

          FADE OUT.
