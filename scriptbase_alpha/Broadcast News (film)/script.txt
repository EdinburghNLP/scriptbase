     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

     A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
     restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
     door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
     state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
     inside as we SUPER:

          KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

     INT. TRUCK - DAY

     As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
     REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
     He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

                    GERALD
          I don't know a recent Saturday I've
          sold more.  You didn't think I'd
          sell that health restaurant, did you?

                    TOM
          No.  Not even you.

                    GERALD
          Why so glum?

                    TOM
          I don't know.

                    GERALD
               (a beat)
          Go ahead.

                    TOM
          No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
          I guess.

                    GERALD
          Were you bothering by those
          waitresses making a fuss?

                    TOM
          No.  But, honest.  What are you
          supposed to say when they keep
          talking about your looks?  I don't
          even know what they mean -- "Beat
          them off with a stick."

     Gerald stiffs a grin.

                    GERALD
          You know, Tom, I feel a little
          proud when people comment on your
          looks.  Maybe you should feel that
          way.

                    TOM
          Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
          I like when they say those things.

                    GERALD
          As long as that's your only problem
          you're...

                    TOM
          It's not.

     He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

                    TOM
          I got my report card.  Three Cs,
          two Ds and an incomplete.

                    GERALD
          Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
          Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

                    TOM
          I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
          know.  I will.
               (talking himself
                into it)
          I will.  I will.  I will.

     He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
     talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

                    TOM
          Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
          you sign it, please?

                    GERALD
               (as he signs)
          Would it help if I got you a tutor?

                    TOM
               (suddenly hopeful)
          That would be great.
               (worried)
          It better help.  What can you do with
          yourself if all you do is look good?

     BOSTON, MASS. - 1965

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

     AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
     graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
     rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

                    AARON
          ...and finally to the teachers of
          Whitman High School, I don't have the
          words to express my gratitude which
          may have more to say about the quality 
          of the English Department here than 
          my own limitations...

     He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
     discomfort.

                    AARON
          ...that was, of course, not meant to
          be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
          I am frequently asked what the special 
          difficulties are in being graduated 
          from High School two months shy of my 
          fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
          think it was the difficulties 
          themselves which enabled me to do it.
          If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
          I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
          graduate.  I hope the next student who
          comes along and is able to excel isn't
          made to feel so much an outcast.  But
          I'm looking forward to college; this is
          the happiest day I've had in a long
          time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

     This is very little applause.

     ANGLE ON TEACHERS

                    MALE TEACHER
          I'm always so confused by Aaron.
          Is he brave and earnest or just
          a conceited little dick-head?

     BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

     ANGLE ON STAGE

     As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
     semi-literate high school graduates.

                    YOUTH #1
          Later, Aaron.

     EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

     Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
     yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
     cuff Aaron around.

     CLOSER IN

     Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
     covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
     something primal triggered by this brutality.

                    AARON
          Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
          last licks.
               (points at his
                face)
          But this will heal -- what I'm
          going to say to you will scar you
          forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

     He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
     and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
     devastating verbal blow.

                    AARON
          You'll never make more than
          nineteen thousand dollars a year.
          Ha ha ha.

     They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
     concrete.

                    AARON
          Okay, take this:  You'll never
          leave South Boston and I'm going
          to see the whole damn world.  You'll
          never know the pleasure of writing
          a graceful sentence or having an
          original thought.  Think about it.

     He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
     Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
     conversation.

                    YOUTH TOUGH
          Nineteen thousand dollars...
          Not bad.

     FADE IN

     ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

     INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

     JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
     desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
     pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
     which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
     a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
     very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

                    JANE
               (voice over; as
                she types)
          Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
          to me that we live a world apart
          and yet have the same favorite music.
          I loved the picture you sent and
          have it up on my bulletin board.
          You're growing so much faster than
          I am that I...

     OTHER ANGLE

     SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

                    JANE
               (voice over)
          ...am starting to get jealous.
          I read in the newspapers about
          the Italian strike and riots in
          Milan.  I hope you weren't...

                    FATHER
               (softly)
          Honey?...

     Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
     nervously at her Dad.

                    JANE
          Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
          don't ever scare me like that --
          please.

     We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

     Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
     Falling back towards the door:

                    FATHER
          Jane -- For God's sake...
               (recovering)
          Look, it's time for you to go
          to sleep.

                    JANE
          I just have two more pen pals and
          then I'm done.

                    FATHER
          You don't have to finish tonight.

                    JANE
               (he doesn't get in)
          Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
          the same.

                    FATHER
          Finish quickly.  I don't want you
          getting obsessive about these 
          things.  Good night.

     We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
     troubled.

     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

     As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
     room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
     mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
     Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

                    JANE
          Dad, you want me to choose my words
          so carefully and then you just throw
          a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
          unless I'm wrong and...
               (enunciating)
          ...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
          is practically a psychiatric term...
          concerning people who don't have anything
          else but the object of their obsession --
          who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
          Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
          So would you please try and be a little
          more precise instead of calling a person
          something like 'obsessive.'

     She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
     even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
     enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
     the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

     Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

     OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

     Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
     twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
     jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
     of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
     Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
     news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
     yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
     the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
     different papers before moving on.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
     The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

     INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

     The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
     hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
     takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
     room number of her crew and reporter.

     ON JANE

     As she dials one room number.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Hi...It's me...

     INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
     essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
     to Jane.

                    JANE'S VOICE
               (voice over)
          It's thirty minutes before you have
          to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
          your wife.

     BACK TO SCENE

                    JANE
          There's probably no time to eat...
          but there's a cafeteria at the bus
          depot once we get down there.  I
          love working with you two...It 
          saves me a call.

     She dales.

     INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

     Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
     monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

                    AARON
          Hi.  Turn on your TV...
          Good Morning America, the
          Morning News and Today are all
          about to talk to Arnold 
          Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
          live on at least two of them.

     BACK TO SCENE

                    JANE
          At six o'clock on the wake-up
          news they used the wrong missile
          graphic.

                    AARON
               (Austrian accent)
          Now listen, Arnold just said that
          he's been making three million a
          movie now.  But he's not ever 
          gonna change.  He's still the same
          person when he was making two 
          million dollars a movie.  He feels
          no different.  He also bought a brand-
          new condo with Maria, they gonna
          furnish tastefully.

                    JANE
          A half hour in the lobby.

                    AARON
               (Austrian accent)
          Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

     She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
     bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
     her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
     waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
     redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
     shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
     episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

     INT. BUS STATION - DAY

     Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
     as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
     do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
     his microphone at the ready.

                    AARON
          Ready.
 
                    CAMERAMAN
          Your hair's a little funny.

                    AARON
          It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
          anything about it.

                    CAMERAMAN
          In front of a little -- it's a bit...
          You want a mirror?

                    AARON
          No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
          do this.

     Jane nods her assent.

                    CAMERAMAN
          Okay.

     AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

                    AARON
          In other times, for other purposes,
          there might be a band and bunting
          here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
          return from war.  He...

                    JANE
               (interrupting)
          I'm sorry.  But look at how
          wonderful his face is.

     She points to the derelict.

                    AARON
          Oh, you mean use him...That's
          nice.  Okay.

                    CAMERAMAN
          I'll put him in the low corner of
          the frame -- good.

                    AARON
          In other times, with other purposes,
          there might be a band and bunting
          here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
          return from war.  Last week he was
          decorated by a president for heroism
          in a war.  But it was the civil war --
          in Angola -- and he was in it for the
          money.

     He puts the microphone down.

                    AARON
          Thanks.

     He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

     INT. GATE AREA - DAY

     Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
     as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
     passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
     emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
     He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

                    J.D.
          Go 'way.

     J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
     crew shooting.

                    AARON
          Just a few questions?

                    J.D.
          No.

     He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

                    AARON
          We came from Washington.

                    J.D.
          Move away from me.

                    AARON
               (holding out
                microphone)
          How long has it been since you've
          been home.

                    J.D.
               (moving)
          Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
          Fuckee.  You want to use that?

                    AARON
          It depends on how big a news day it 
          is.

     They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

                    JANE
          J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
          you in Angola.  I gave you some
          sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

     As he reacts to her:

     INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
     screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

                    AARON
          Where's where I asked him about
          being scared?
               (then)
          You should work on your speech.

                    JANE
          No.  It makes me nervous to think
          about it.  Let's do this.

     She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

                    AARON
               (on tape)
          All this business of war -- do you
          get scared?

                    J.D.
               (on tape; he smiles)
          Uh-uh.
               (then)
          I'm a little freaked right now about
          seeing my father though.

     He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

                    JANE
          I love that turn away.

     INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
     monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
     the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
     Local Television News Broadcasters.

                    JANE
               (in darkness)
          There's a point I'm trying to make
          about these pieces coming up.

     A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
     ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

                    WOMAN
               (o.s.; angrily)
          I don't think any client of mine
          makes less than fifty thousand dollars
          a year which means they can afford the
          best and you're damn right I feel good
          that that includes me.

                                   CUT TO:

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
     in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

                    WOMAN TWO
               (o.s.)
          No.  You'd be surprised at who a
          working girl meets.  I've been a
          working girl for what? -- over a year
          anyway and that must be a thousand
          men and I don't think there's an age
          or type that hasn't been in there.

                    INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
               (voice over)
          Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

                    WOMAN TWO
               (o.s.)
          Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

     A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

                                   CUT TO:

     ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
     A WOMAN in blackness.

                    WOMAN THREE
               (o.s.)
          I'm seventeen now and I've been
          working the streets for two years
          and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
          thinking of it as temporary.

     The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
     there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

                    JANE
          Please don't applaud.

     ON AUDIENCE

     Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
     remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
     looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
     or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
     sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

                    JANE
          Please.  Don't!!
               (she yells)
          I gathered these pieces as an
          example of what's WRONG with local
          television news.

     The applause stops.

                    JANE
          The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
          SERIES on prostitution were
          SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
          stations in one city during sweeps
          week.  By what bend of either or
          suspension of duty is that broadcast
          news?

     She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
     she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
     "gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

                    JANE
          The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
          Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
          David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
          is being squandered in a desperate
          popularity contest.  Our profession
          is in danger:

     TRACKING SHOT

     As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
     more in common.  They do not like Jane.

                    JANE
          Yesterday's compliment has somehow
          managed to become today's kiss of
          death.  To be considered a serious
          journalist is no longer flattering.
          It presents the risk of being labeled
          ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
          right?

     SHOT CONTINUES

     Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
     middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

     ON JANE

     Briefly departing from text.

                    JANE
          All of you know what I'm talking about.  
          We're all trying to act together than 
          we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
          secretly terrified, aren't we?

     Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
     prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
     begins to rasp.

                    JANE
          We are being increasingly influenced
          by the star system.  The network
          anchormen are so powerful they 
          compromise our last best hope.  The 
          current group is clearly qualified, 
          tied still to our best traditions, but 
          who follows these men?

     TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

     Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
     woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
     Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
     a speaker, she seems a savior.

                    TOM
          Wow.

     His female colleague looks at him.

                    FEMALE COLLEAGUE
          Oh, I've known so many women like
          that.  They don't like their looks
          so they're angry.

     BACK TO JANE

     Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
     wish.

                    JANE
          I was going to talk about other
          trends but...
               (mumbling)
          ...the magazine shows, news at
          profit, influence of
          Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
          hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
          was going to show you a tape -- a story
          that was carried by all networks on the
          same night -- the same night -- not one
          network noted a major policy change in
          Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
          Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
          Show the tape.

     ON MONITORS

     Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
     networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
     dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
     bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
     loudly and squeals with delight.

     ON SCENE

     Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
     the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

                    JANE
               (loudly)
          I know it's good film.  I know it's
          fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
               (as they continue
                to applaud)
          Well, you're lucky you love it --
          you're going to get a lot more just
          like it.

     STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

     OTHER ANGLE

     Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
     Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
     some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

     WIDER

     Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
     she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
     mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
     Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

                    TOM
          Hello.

     She looks up at him.

     ANGLE ON TOM

     Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
     there it is.

                    JANE
          Hi.

                    TOM
          I just wanted to tell you  how great 
          you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

                    JANE
               (dumbly)
          Thank you.
               (then)
          They hated me.  I don't hate them.

                    TOM
          Well, they say if you can reach
          even one person, it means something...
          And you did that.

     Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

                    JANE
          Would you like to have dinner
          with me?

     INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
     up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
     looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
     her side.

                    JANE
          Hi.  I was worried I was early.

                    TOM
          I was a lot earlier.

     They are lead to a table and sit down.

                    TOM
          I kept thinking what a great break
          it was for me to get to see you
          tonight.  More than a great break,
          maybe just what I needed...just when
          I needed it...Angel of mercy --
          godsend...lifesaver...what?

                    JANE
               (picking one)
          I like "godsend."

                    TOM
          I haven't been in news that long.
          I've just been looking for the
          right person to talk to.  I have
          about two thousand questions for you.

     He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
     continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

                    TOM
          It's possible now's not the right
          time.

     She lifts her head.

                    JANE
          If we could just eat first.

                    TOM
          Totally understood.  Totally
          wrong of me to talk shop after
          the day you've had.  Totally
          sorry.

                    JANE
          Nooo.  If I could just have a
          roll, I'd be okay.

     She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
     takes a bite.

                    JANE
          Thank you.

     EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

     As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
     Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
     adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
     making a memorable mistake.

                    JANE
          Another thing I can't stand --
          Is this dull?

     Tom shakes his head almost violently.

                    TOM
          No, no, no, no...

     Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

                    JANE
               (broadly)
          Another thing I can't stand is
          ...when White House reporters
          bullshit with each other after
          a briefing and then one of them
          has a theory and the other quotes
          it in his story as "White House"
          sources say...

                    TOM
          That actually goes on...

                    JANE
          Yes.  My room is down here --
          I'm not tired.  Do you want to
          keep talking?

                    TOM
          Yes, sure.

     INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
     evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
     notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
     Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
     and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
     enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
     portable STEREO system.

                    JANE
          Come on...Even I'm not that
          hard on myself.

                    TOM
          No, I really got this job on a
          fluke and wait till you hear where
          it ends up.

     Jane smiles a calming smile.

                    JANE
          I was doing sports at the station.
          The newspaper ran this untrue story
          that I was leaving and they got all
          these tons of protest mail.  So they
          made me anchor.

                    JANE
          So great -- right?

                    TOM
          Except I'm no good at what I'm being
          a success at.

                    JANE
          How are you at back rubs?

     Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
     immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
     than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
     experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
     briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
     from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

                    JANE
          It's sort of normal -- the way you
          feel.  In graduate school everyone
          thought the only mistake the
          admission committee made was letting
          them in.

     He moves to the bed.

                    TOM
          Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
          I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
          That's not it.  I know I can talk well
          enough and I'm not bad at making contact
          with people, but I don't like the 
          feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
          reporter.
               (cont'd)
          And half the time I don't really get 
          the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
          that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
          I stink.

                    JANE
               (levelly)
          I trust you.

                    TOM
          I didn't even have the chance to get
          really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
          I thought I was starting to do
          interesting features but hockey is
          big at the station and...

                    JANE
               (interrupting)
          What about the obvious remedy?
          Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
          job on a newspaper.

                    TOM
          I don't write.

     Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

                    TOM
          But that didn't stop me from
          sending out audition tapes to
          bigger stations and the networks.

                    JANE
          Well, come on -- it is your life.
          Nobody is tying you to the fast
          track.  Did you go to college?

                    TOM
          One year...almost one year.

                    JANE
          So, you're not well educated and
          you have almost no experience and
          you can't write.

     He nods agreement.

                    TOM
          And I'm making a fortune.

     Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
     her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
     the bed.

                    JANE
          It's hard for me to advise you
          since you personify something that
          I truly think is dangerous.

                    TOM
          Uh-huh.

                    JANE
               (holding it in)
          I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
               (letting it out)
          So get qualified.  You can insist on
          being better prepared.  You don't have
          to just leave it as...
               (mimicking him)
          'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
          I don't understand the news I'm reading.
          But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

     A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

                    TOM
          Whoa, this was a mistake.

                    JANE
          Just what do you want from me, anyway?
          Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
          and do something about it.

     He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

                    JANE
          Well, you don't have to start right now.

     He turns to her.

                    TOM
          I hated the way you talked to me just
          now...and it wasn't just because you
          were right.

     He exits.

     INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

     She is on the phone.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          No.  It wasn't just the speech --
          the same thing happened with this
          guy.  I have passed some line some
          place.  I am beginning to repel people
          I'm trying to seduce.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As he talks with Jane.

                    AARON
               (agreeably)
          He must have been great-looking, right?

                    JANE
          Why do you say that?

                    AARON
          Because nobody invites a bad-
          looking idiot to their bedroom.

     She smiles.

                    AARON
          Okay.  Let's do me.

                    JANE
          Sure.

                    AARON
          Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
          do people who are actually slipping
          feel that way or is it always the
          really good people who are moving up
          who invariably think they're slipping
          because their standards are so high?

                    JANE
          This conversation is not worthy of you.

                    AARON
          I'd give anything if that were true.

                    JANE
               (laughing)
          Good night.

                    AARON
          Wouldn't this be a great world if
          insecurity and desperation made us
          more attractive?  If needy were a
          turn-on?

                    JANE
          Call if you get weird.

     INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

     She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
     on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
     clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
     The PHONE RINGS.

                    JANE
               (answering)
          I was just thinking it was the
          shortest phone conversation we
          ever had.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH

     A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

                    TOM
          I never told you the reason I was
          telling you everything for.

                    JANE
               (pleasantly surprised
                it's him)
          Hey?

     INTERCUT:

     ON TOM

                    TOM
          Those audition tapes I sent out...
          I've been hired by your network for
          the Washington bureau.  So I'll
          probably see you at work.  Sorry.

     Jane is rocked and soured.

                    JANE
          What???

     EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

     Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

                    AARON
          They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
          the Times and he had a great
          audition tape.

                    JANE
          You want to start going over who they
          could have gotten?  They can't take on
          people like this for network news.  For
          God's sake.  What's going on?

     INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

     Tom arrives for first day of work.

     INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

     ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
     is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
     -- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
     a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
     thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
     holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

                    ERNIE
          Any particular area you feel
          strongest in?

                    TOM
          To be honest, I was best at anchor.

     Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

                    ERNIE
          Why don't you take a few days observing
          the system?  Then we'll put you on
          general assignment.

     EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

     Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
     timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
     monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
     Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
     which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
     PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
     which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
     with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
     out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
     remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

                    JANE
               (consulting notes)
          Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
          bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
          don't know how I'll feel...'

                    BOBBIE
          We could...

                    JANE
               (interrupting)
          Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

     As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
     the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
     Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
     welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
     a piece for himself against the wall.

                    TOM
          They said I should observe the...

     Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

                    TOM
          They said it would be okay if...

                    JANE
               (incredulous)
          We're working here!!  You can stand
          over in the uh, uh, uh...

     She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
     to Bobbie:

                    JANE
          Play back the last line...

                    BOBBIE
          He said something about...

                    JANE
               (sharply)
          Let me hear it!

     Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
     yet still repressed resentment.

     The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
     She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
     Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

                    BLAIR
          We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
          putting it directly into...

     Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
     ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Craig, just a second --
               (to Bobbie)
          Let me hear it!

     Through much of this chaos we focus on:

     TOM

     Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
     He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
     dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
     always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

                    MERCENARY
               (voice over)
          It's been a long time since I've seen
          my folks and all but...I don't expect
          any big-deal homecoming.

                    JANE
          Stop there.
               (into phone she's
                been holding)
          I want to shoot a picture from
          a book I have in the office.

                    BLAIR
          You don't have time.  Not a chance.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

     She crosses out.

                    BLAIR
          I've got to tell Ernie...because
          there isn't enough time.

                    JANE
          Yes, there is.

     Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
     leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

                    TOM
          I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
          General Assignment today.

     Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
     Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

                    BOBBIE
          I don't think she's going to make it.

     Tom exits.

     INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

     Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
     JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
     beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
     known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
     MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
     State Department correspondent for the network.

                    KLEIN
          Okay, what about this?  Here's a
          tough ethical one.  Would you tell
          a source that you loved them just
          to get some information?

                    AARON
          Yes.

                    GEORGE
          Yes.

                    ERNIE
          Me too.

                    JENNIFER
          Sure.

                    AARON
          Jennifer didn't know there
          was an alternative.

     Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
     will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

                    AARON
          Here's one.  They allow us to have
          cameras at an execution in Florida.
          Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
          the chair when they turn on the
          voltage?

                    KLEIN
          Sure.

                    JENNIFER
          Why not?

                    ERNIE
          Absolutely.

                    GEORGE
          You bet.

                    AARON
          Nothing like wrestling with a
          moral dilemma is there?

     Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
     continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

                    BLAIR
          Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
          to air and Jane's shooting an insert
          still for tonight's piece.

                    ERNIE
          She knows how much time she has.

     Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

                    BLAIR
          Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

                    AARON
          What is she shooting?

                    BLAIR
          Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

                    AARON
               (thinks then)
          Oh, that's nice...
               (walking away)
          We'll need some new lines.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
     watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
     impressed.

                    JANE
          Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
          dissolve to the Rockwell.

                    BOBBIE
          Should I...

                    JANE
               (interrupting)
          Just a two-second dissolve.

                    BLAIR
               (hurting)
          Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
          Why do you do this to me.  Is it
          because I won an award?

     INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

     Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
     paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
     stop watch.

                    AARON
          Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
          of a Homecoming  The return of a
          fighting man has always been one of
          the more moving ceremonies of war...
          Tearful women, proud men, excited
          children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
          his homecoming was no big deal.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

                    BLAIR
          We have a minute and a half.  It's my
          responsibility to tell them we won't
          be ready.

                    JANE
          Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

     Blair glances frantically at her watch.

                    BLAIR
          In 84 seconds?

     ON CLOCK

     Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
     walks in, Jane looks up.

                    JANE
               (hopefully)
          Nine seconds.

                    AARON
          Eleven and a half.

                    JANE
          Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

     ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
     DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

                    BLAIR
          You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
          going to go to up and the screen will
          be black -- they're going to go to black
          because we're not there.  How about
          careers, huh?  How about careers?

     ON CLOCK

     42 seconds away.

                    BLAIR
          We're not going to make it.

     Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
     of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

                    BOBBIE
          Whoops.

                    BLAIR
               (unravelling)
          Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
          no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

                    AARON
          Shit, shit, shit...

                    TOM
               (caught up)
          You're almost there, you can do it --
          can do -- can do.

     And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
     hands the tape to Blair.

                    BOBBIE
          Ready.

     INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

     Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

     VARIOUS SHOTS

     Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
     chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
     the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
     elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
     nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
     down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
     arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
     introduced on the air.

     INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

     Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
     air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

                    BLAIR
          I was a little nervous there for
          a minute.

                    AARON
          Oh, come on -- tell us another.

     ON MONITOR

     The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
     mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
     irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
     BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
     He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
     journalistic king.

                    BILL
               (on monitor, smiling)
          Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

                    JENNIFER
          Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
          good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
          liked it.

                    AARON
          He loved it.  Big smile.

     He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
     returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

                    BLAIR
          I haven't seen Bill smile like that
          in weeks.

     Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

                    BLAIR
          Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
               (mimicking)
          Thank you...Good night.

     She smiles.

                    ERNIE
          I saw the smile -- good piece.

                    AARON
          I'm gonna go look at it again.

     They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
     others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

                    TOM
          I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
          was totally impressive.  Great piece.

                    JANE
               (somewhat formal)
          You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
          feel being here?

                    TOM
          I can't believe I'm really here.  No
          kidding.  If you're through work now --

                    JANE
          No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
          on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

                    TOM
          I thought you were incredible in there.
          I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
          really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

                    JANE
          'Really a lot appreciate it...'

                    TOM
          You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
          can pick your brain --

     Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

                    JANE
          I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
          here to teach remedial reporting.

                    TOM
          And it has nothing to do with the fact
          I left your room instead of staying 
          there?

     Jane looks at him.

                    JANE
          Oh, please.
               (then, almost gently)
          You're gonna have to understand
          something.  This isn't personal.

     She exits.

     EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

     As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
     in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
     they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

                    AARON
          I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
          and less air time.  They don't think
          I'm at all anchor material.

                    JANE
          If we don't get to their camp soon,
          we won't be able to tape the supplies
          coming in.

                    AARON
          Last time Paul was sick they gave
          Connie the weekend news instead of me.

                    JANE
          You spend too much time -- much too
          much worrying about that crap...
               (suddenly reacting)
          Oh good.

     They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
     the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
     inside.

     ANGLE ON

     A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
     sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
     Spanish, then English:

                    CAMERAMAN
          Put on the boot.

     Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

                    JANE
          Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
          Wait and see what he does.

     Then to the totally confused soldier.

                    JANE (cont'd)
          Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
          your choice.

     By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
     the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
     what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
     save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
     on the boot.

                    JANE
               (to Cameraman)
          Okay.

     He shoots the scene.

     INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

     Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

                    TOM
          Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
          Could you give me that address again?
          Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
          getting to work.  Okay that's
          17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

     As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

                    CONCIERGE
          It's only ten minutes if you prefer
          to walk...
               (as he walks away)
          I'll look for you on the news tonight.

     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

     Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
     strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
     to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

     EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

     Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
     to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

                    AARON (in Spanish)
          Are you guys kidding or do you really
          think you'll run into something...?
          I mean, do you feel that every time
          and it never happens?  Or is it the
          first time it felt that way and it's
          going to happen?... I mean, how bad
          can it be?... Are you nervous...?
          What's the chances on a scale of one
          to ten -- that we're going to be in
          a war within the next few hours?...
          Really?

     He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
     talking with calling after him with an added thought.

                    AARON
          Thanks, you speak English very well
          too.
               (to Jane)
          Great news.  He says they've been
          engaging the Sandinistas pretty
          regularly and that he'd be really
          surprised if we didn't take fire 
          tonight.

     Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
     attitude.

                    AARON
          Look at her.
               (to Jane)
          If anything happens to me tell every
          woman I've ever dated I was talking
          about them at the end.  That way they'll
          have to reevaluate me.

     Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
     Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
     The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
     grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
     more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

                    JANE
          Let's tape.

                    CAMERAMAN
               (Spanish accent)
          Much too dark.  Black.

                    JANE
          That's okay.

     ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

     As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
     the nearly gunfire.

                    AARON
          The first shots were fired not thirty
          seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
          must be outnumbered this is so small
          a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
          hold their ground despite the fact
          that their weapons have been acting
          up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
          shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
          all they got today were the shoes.

     There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

                    JANE
               (to Cameraman)
          Okay.
               (to Aaron)
          Great line at the end.

                    AARON
          Did you shoot their boots?

                    JANE
          Of course.

                    AARON
          We can cut back at the end.

                    JANE
          To the pan of the supplies boxes --

                    AARON
          Can you believe it?  I just risked my
          life for a network that tests my face
          with focus groups.

     EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

     Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
     police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

                    REPORTER
          I think he's coming out now.

                    TOM
               (to his crew)
          They say he's coming out now.

     A surge.

                    TOM
               (to Reporter)
          Is that him?

                    TOM'S CAMERAMAN
          Yes.

     Tom checks his notes.


     INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

     The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
     written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
     to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

     TOM'S P.O.V.

     The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
     "Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
     awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
     movement of the vehicle.

     ON TOM

     Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

                    CAMERAMAN
               (observing Tom)
          What's wrong?

                    TOM
          I had a lot of questions here.  I
          missed the story.

                    CAMERAMAN
          Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
          a piece of his face.

     EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

     Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
     in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

                    JANE
          Are you all packed and ready?

                    CAMERAMAN
          The stuff in the dark is not good.
          Nobody wants news lit like that.

                    JANE
          Will you just get packed?

     She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
     a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
     through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
     toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
     from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
     about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
     sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
     away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
     explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

     INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

     The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
     watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
     the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
     one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

     ON TELEVISION MONITORS

     Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
     blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
     A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

                    BILL (voice over)
          A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
          border...in one minute.

     The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
     dim outline and HEAR him say:

                    AARON (voice over; on camera)
          The first shots were fired not thirty
          seconds ago.

     The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
     The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
     enthusiastically.

                    BLAIR
          Great graphic, great graphic.

     Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
     Aaron on the back.

                    ERNIE
          You finally got a piece in a few
          minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

     Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

                    ERNIE (continuing)
          I have somebody downstairs who one of
          the clerks brought in and vouches for.
          He says he has something to say about
          gays getting promotions at State...
          It can't hurt to tape him.

     ON JANE

     As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
     for the first time.

                    TOM
          Hi.

                    JANE
          How's it going?

                    TOM
          Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

                    JANE
               (thrown)
          I just got back -- I don't know
          which end is up.

                    TOM
          Okay.

     In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
     picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
     break.

                    BLAIR
          Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
          to you at the break.
               (as she hands it to her)
          I never heard of him handing over
          compliments in the middle of the
          show.

     There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
     anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

     ON MONITOR

     We see Bill Rorish.

                    BILL
               (into phone)
          Jane?

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Yes.

                    BILL
               (into phone)
          Well, darling, if it gets any better than
          that, I'm going to have to bring you up
          here to New York.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
          twenty seconds.

     Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          But thanks.

                    BILL
               (over phone)
          Well, the visual with the boots at the
          end was just perfect.

     Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

                    JANE
          God, he loved the boots.

     Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Aaron should be hearing this so I
          have an extra witness.

                    BILL
               (over phone)
          Well, you always want to give the 
          credit away, do you?

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
          the credit.  He's right here.

                    BILL
               (over phone)
          I'll speak to you soon

     We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

                    JANE
               (to Aaron)
          He had to read over some new copy.

     We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
     Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

                    TOM
               (to the rescue)
          Okay if I watch you tape that interview
          downstairs?

                    AARON
          Yeah.

     As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

                    AARON
          Please laugh so they think I'm not
          dying inside but have so much style
          I just said something funny.

     Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
     but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
     Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

                    BLAIR
          What did he say?

                    JANE
               (as if still amused)
          I'll never tell.

     INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
     well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
     ask a question.

                    BUDDY
          Could I see how I photograph?

                    CAMERAWOMAN
          Huh?  Sorry?

                    BUDDY
          'Cause for the interview they're
          going to use a screen and disguise
          me to protect my anonymity so could
          I see myself before that?

                    CAMERAWOMAN
          Sure.

     The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
     comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
     happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
     gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
     Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
     But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
     internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
     fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
     thoughts.

     Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

                    AARON
          It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

                    BUDDY
          Yes.

                    AARON
          That's your full name?

                    BUDDY
          Yes.

                    AARON
          I might as well ask you the questions
          on tape.  Is that all right?

                    BUDDY
          Yes.

                    AARON
          You worked at one time as 
          Foreign Service Trainee in the
          State Department.

                    BUDDY
          I was there two years and was promoted
          on merit nine times.

                    AARON
          Eventually rising to...

                    BUDDY
          Office Bimbo. 
               (curbing his amusement) 
          No, I'm sorry.

     Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

                    AARON
          You're saying the fact that you're
          gay had something directly to do with
          your promotions?

                    AARON
          Eventually rising to?

                    BUDDY

          G.S.  I don't know.
               (scratches his head)
          I don't know numbers.

     Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

                    AARON
          You're saying the fact that you're gay had
          something directly to do with your promotions?

                    BUDDY
          I don't like the word gay.

                    AARON
          Which would you prefer?

                    BUDDY
          Ravenous homosexual.

                    AARON
          Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
          Ellen.  Let's call security and
          get him out.

     As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
     walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

                    BUDDY
               (self flagellating)
          Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
          won't be happy until you turn the
          whole world off.

     He notices Tom.

                    BUDDY
          They're not really going to call
          security are they?

                    TOM
          No, I don't think so.

                    BUDDY
          How do I get out of here?

                    TOM
          Follow me.

                    BUDDY
               (dazzled)
          You talked me into it.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
     self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
     tension of romance and adventure.

     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

     A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

                    GUARD
          Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
          coming to find you.

                    BUDDY
          I'm leaving.

                    TOM
               (to Guard)
          It's okay.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

                    BUDDY
          Sir?

     Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
     about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
     of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

                    BUDDY (cont'd)
          Thank you for not shunning me and
          all.
               (more)
          I really did have all that information
          but I thought I might just be being
          vindictive to get a little hunk of
          the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
          but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
          thanks again and would you like to
          have a drink -- at a regular bar?

                    TOM
          Oh, sure.  Okay.

     His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

                    BUDDY
          Is there a regular bar around here?

     INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

     Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
     been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
     attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

                    TOM
          I've been doing some morning show
          stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
          bother me.  I'm in no rush for
          anything.  It's just the snotty
          attitude, even if I have it coming,
          it's still...

                    BUDDY
          Bad manners.

                    TOM
          Yes.  That's right.

                    BUDDY
          I know...I mean you didn't do anything
          special for me tonight.  You just had
          what I think are good manners, decency.
          And it really makes me want to be nice
          back and it has nothing to do with any
          homosexual thing.
               (looks right at him)
          Honestly.
               (then away)
          Because I don't know if you've
          homosexual or not and -- you're not,
          are you?

                    TOM
          No...no.

                    BUDDY
          One's enough.

     Tom signals for the check.

                    BUDDY (cont'd)
          I wasn't doing anything.

                    TOM
          I really have to go.

                    BUDDY
          Okay.  At least let me show my
          appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
          is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
          For the graft thing he supposedly did
          before he was appointed.

                    TOM
          What?

                    BUDDY
          Yes, it's true.  They're going to
          make it public Wednesday but isn't
          it a big deal for you to have it a
          day and a half early?

                    TOM
          Yes.  How do you know?

                    BUDDY
               (shrugs)
          My roommate's very social -- somebody
          from Justice was over and...I always
          hear things before they happen.  Hey,
          and from now on, so do you.

     INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

     George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
     office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

                    GEORGE
          I'm virtually certain it's not true.
          He may be indicted eventually, but I
          don't think it will be this month.

                    ERNIE
               (to Tom)
          You want to be alone with me --
          tell me your source?

                    TOM
          If I told you I'm not sure it would 
          totally convince you, but I totally 
          believe the guy.

                    GEORGE
               (insufferable)
          Labor is my Department -- I can't
          conform it and my contacts go very
          deep.

                    TOM
          So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
          right?

                    ERNIE
          It's not even a close call.  Of
          course we can't go with it.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

     Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
     make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
     George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

                    BOBBIE
          Do you want him all the way to the 
          car?

                    JANE
          No stop where he's all besieged.

                    BOBBIE
          Because...

                    JANE
               (to Bobbie)
          Right there, Bobbie.

     Tom enters.

                    TOM
          So he was indicted?

                    JANE
          Yes.

                    GEORGE
          We were right not to go with it.

                    TOM
          But I was right -- just somebody give
          it to me.  I had a good story.

                    JANE
               (to George)
          Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

                    TOM
          Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
          and I serve anonymously.

     He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

                    BOBBIE
               (pausing in his work)
          You know, I like Tom, because hi...

                    JANE
          Bobbie, please.

     INT. METRO BUS - DAY

     Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

                    BUDDY
          ...and the White House is hoping to
          keep a lid on it for a few days till
          they figure out what to do.

                    TOM
          Thanks a lot, Buddy.

                    BUDDY
               (brushing it off)
          Oh, please.  So they were really
          impressed with you at work.

                    TOM
          Not impressed exactly -- but a break
          in the clouds.

                    BUDDY
          I see the change in you -- I see it.

     INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

     The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
     network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
     steers her outside.

     EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

     In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
     MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

                    TOM
               (to Jennifer)
          So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
          a greatly reduced price while he was
          there in charge of the White House
          Advance Team.

                    JENNIFER
          How come you're not chasing it down
          yourself?

                    TOM
          Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
          your beat.

                    JENNIFER
          Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
          all deal with each other like this.
          I'll check it.  Anything I can do
          for you?

                    TOM
          This is my first time at the White House.
          Is there any chance to look at where
          he works and the rest of it?

                    JENNIFER
          I didn't have the guts to ask when
          I first came up.  I'll get you a
          great tour.

     INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

     Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
     her story.

                    JENNIFER
               (voice over; on TV set)
          The President says it's not a violation
          but nonetheless White House sources
          say the full price will be paid for the
          Peugeot and new rules will put future
          bargain hunting off limits for
          Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
          at the White House.

     Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

                    BUDDY
          Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
          being a news source.

                    TOM
          Nobody else had it.

                    BUDDY
          I wish it were you giving the story.

                    TOM
          That's okay.

                    BUDDY
          What if we just don't tell them
          anything anymore unless they let
          you do the story?

                    TOM
          No.  Really...don't worry about it.

                    BUDDY
          Okay.  And look, in the future I can
          call you when I have news for you.
          Don't feel you have to spend time
          with me just to get the information.
               (a breath; then
                to himself)
          Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
          you thought, was it, Buddy?

                    TOM
          What do you mean?  You're one of the
          few people in this town I can talk
          to.

     Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
     RAPTURE.

                    BUDDY
          Hoooo.

     The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
     with discomfort.

                    TOM
          Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

                    BUDDY
               (simply)
          Okay.

     INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

     Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
     as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
     calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

     INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

     He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
     after her.

     INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

     As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
     running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
     to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

     EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

     Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
     He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
     back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
     her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
     fairly social:

                    JANE
          Hi, how are you?

     She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

                    TOM
          Wait -- I need you.

     She stops.

                    TOM
          I've got another story.

                    JANE
          Some public official skipped a week
          on his Christmas Club?

                    TOM
          The House Armed Service Committee
          has a secret report which says that
          the General Stillwell tank the Army
          has dumped a fortune into plain 
          won't work.  I have it cold,
          confirmed.  They have five million
          dollars in this thing already.

                    JANE
          Billion.

                    TOM
          Okay, billion...right, of course.
          They told me I could have any producer
          I wanted -- and I want you.

     As Tom savors the moment.

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
     piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

                    TOM
               (voice over)
          One source referred to it as a
          five billion dollar metal sculpture
          to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

                    AARON
               (to Jane)
          You write this?

                    JANE
          I write for you sometimes.

                    AARON
          Not because you have to.

     ON MONITOR

     We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

                    TOM
               (voice over)
          General Elton McGuire is in charge of
          the weapon system.

     ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

                    GENERAL
          I've been in the Army twenty-seven
          years -- so I'll let the Army ask
          the questions, not you.

                    TOM
          General, I don't want to bother you
          anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
          there will be a mob of me back here --
          so, if you have anything to say, why
          not say it now, sir, the way you want?

     ON TOM

     He is a study.

     Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
     television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
     work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
     answers in the b.g. --

                    BLAIR
          I think it's great of us to have left
          in what you said -- just great of us.

     Tom smiles modestly.

                    AARON
          Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
          the real story.  Not them.

     Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
     In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

                    JANE
          Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
          on it.

                    BLAIR
          I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
          human.

     Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
     in tow... He approaches Tom.

                    ERNIE
          My youngest wanted to meet you.
          This is Ellie.

                    TOM
          Hi, Ellie.

                    ERNIE
          You should be honored -- she
          never cares about meeting
          anyone here.  But she liked you
          on television just now.

                    AARON
               (entering scene)
          Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

                    ELLIE
          I'm sorry -- from where?

                    AARON
          I've been to your house a lot...

                    ERNIE
               (helping)
          And Aaron went on that fourteen
          day raft trip with us last year.

                    ELLIE
               (vaguely)
          Oh yes -- hi.

     INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

     Tom is on the phone.

                    TOM
               (into phone)
          Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
          I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
          haven't called.  Things were a little
          bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
          I'm fine now.
               (what he's been
                wanting to say aloud)
          Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
          do this job...Well, I'm glad you
          were sure.

     INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

     Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
     around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
     and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

                    BLAIR
          I don't know why we have to feel
          defensive about it.  Newspapers
          are in business to make money --
          why not us?

     Aaron looks at her in amazement.

                    BLAIR
          They criticize us for supposedly
          pandering while they run WINGO
          Games.

                    GREY HAIRED MAN
               (amused)
          Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
          paid to mix.

     Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
     group.

                    BLAIR
          Goodbye, Paul.

                    AARON
          Take care, Paul.
               (back to Blair)
          It takes a certain kind of courage
          for you to say that in front of
          the President of the News Division.

                    BLAIR
          You think anyone who's proud of
          the work we do is an ass kisser.

                    AARON
          No.  I think anyone who puckers their
          lips and presses it against his boss'
          buttocks and then smooches is an ass
          kisser.

                    BLAIR
          My gosh, and for a while there, I was
          attracted to you.

     She walks off.

                    AARON
          Wait a minute -- that changes
          everything.

     ON JANE

     At the bar getting a drink.

     Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
     they are standing alone.

                    JENNIFER
          This is very awkward.

                    JANE
          Go ahead -- what?

                    JENNIFER
          Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
          I see Tom around you a lot and this
          is such a small office and I'd like
          to see him outside of work, unless
          there's some reason for you to mind...
          in which case I just won't do anything.

                    JANE
          God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
          Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
          a shock -- I don't have a right to...
          I don't think I like him.  I know
          I don't respect him...So what am
          I talking about -- what am I saying
          to you?

                    JENNIFER
          You're saying stay away from him.

                    JANE
               (stupefied)
          I can't be.

     She blinks in wonder.

                    JENNIFER
          We don't have to settle this
          definitively right now.

     Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
     by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
     and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
     moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
     breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
     CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

                    GEORGE WELN
          Tell me one person who ever left
          television news to work on a
          newspaper.

     She moves on; Tom still following.

                    ERNIE'S WIFE
               (holding Paul's arm)
          I felt so proud when he turned
          down News Vice President so we
          could stay here.  Suddenly, after
          all these years, we have a life.

     Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
     feet away.

                    JANE
               (badly)
          Hi, Tom.

     She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
     now.  He crosses to her.

                    TOM
          It's the firs time I've seen 
          you dressed like this.  You look
          so clean and pretty.

                    JANE
          What do you mean clean?

                    TOM
          At work there's always this
          sort of film over you.

                    JANE
          Well, thumps like me leave appearance
          to guys like you.

                    TOM
          You're great at taking the edge
          off a good time.

     Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
     his arm to steady herself.

                    TOM
          You okay?

                    JANE
          Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
          for a while.  Thanks.

     She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
     control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
     she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

                    JANE
          I've got to find someone.  It's
          important.  Excuse me.

     She walks away.

     ON AARON AND ERNIE

                    ERNIE
          I had the strangest thing happen
          yesterday.  Anne and I have been
          married what? -- Thirty-six years...
          Everything fine -- two days after the
          promotion came through, I was checking
          myself in the mirror and she was
          making a face at me behind my back.
          So yesterday I looked in the mirror
          and she was doing it again.

                    AARON
          You didn't say anything to her?

     He shakes his head.

                    ERNIE
          My instincts tell me not to.

     Annie comes up.

                    ANNE
          The office is phoning, honey.

     He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

                    ANNE
          I hope he moves that fast when
          it's me on the line.

     ON JANE

     As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
     picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
     sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
     too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

                    JANE
          Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

     ON STAIRCASE

     Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

                    JANE
          Forget what I said -- you do
          whatever you want to with him.

     She pushes at Jennifer a little.

                    JENNIFER
          Well, there's nothing I'm going
          to do right this second.

     Jane pushes her again.

                    JENNIFER
          But it's a party, right?

     Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
     down the steps and crosses to Tom.

     FULL SCENE

     Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
     Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
     and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
     The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
     a few words:

                    ERNIE
          This would be a good time to tap
          that source of yours.  He could
          have an angle or something.

     AARON'S P.O.V.

     Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
     looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
     now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
     energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
     them.

                    ERNIE
               (to Jane)
          We want you to exec produce a
          Special Report...

                    JANE
          What?

     Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

                    ERNIE
          A Libyan plane shot up one of our
          bases in Egypt.  It's all still
          happening.

                    JANE
          Let's figure out the field.

                    ERNIE
          Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
          he's made out the assignments...
          Jennifer at the White House...
          George at the Pentagon...Martin
          at State...and we need an anchor
          since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
          gonna do the whole report this
          afternoon from here...with Tom.

                    AARON
          That's it.  I resign as of now.

                    ERNIE
               (to Aaron)
          Stop it.

                    AARON
          I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
          Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

                    JANE
          Ernie, as much as I like you, I
          think I have to tell Paul what I
          think, because this is really sort
          of obscenely stupid.

                    ERNIE
          Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
          don't disagree with you.

     Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
     big boss.

     ON JANE

     As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
     catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
     "BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

                    TOM
          Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
          this is Tom.  You can reach me
          at the office.  It's important.
          I can use a little help.

     Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
     intensity.

                    JANE
          Tom isn't ready for the job
          you're about to hand him.  Not
          near ready.  Not by the longest
          shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
          in Tripoli, he's interviewed
          Gaddafi -- he reported on the
          Eight-one story.  I think he's
          essential to do the job we're
          capable of and I think it's my
          responsibility to tell you that.

                    PAUL
          Okay, that's your opinion.  I
          don't agree.

                    JANE
          It's not opinion.

                    PAUL
          You're just absolutely right
          and I'm absolutely wrong?

     She nods.

                    PAUL
          It must be nice to always believe
          you know better.  To think you're
          always the smartest person in the
          room.

                    JANE
               (from her depths)
          No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

                    JANE
               (turning to leave)
          We'd better get moving.

     As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
     towards the door.

                    AARON
          What happened?

                    JANE
          I'll tell you later -- where
          you going to watch from?

                    AARON
          Watch? --

                    JANE
          I'll come by your place, right
          after...drink, take pills...
          Love you.

     She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
     last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

                    AARON
          Yeah, love you, too.

     EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

     As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
     the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

     INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

     As it moves off.

                    JANE
          Nervous?

                    TOM
          Excited.

     Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
     the truth.

     INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

     In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
     activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
     and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
     He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
     one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
     off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
     of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
     the authority figure we know he's now.

     INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

     Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
     calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
     the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

                    JANE
          Tell George and Jessica to try
          and cover everything without
          Tom having to ask additional
          questions.

                    BLAIR
          And Bobbie says...

                    JANE
          Did you hear what I just said --
          do you have that?  Take a breath.

                    BLAIR
               (a breath, then)
          Yes.

     In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
     waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

                    JANE
          And the most important thing
          make sure his earpiece works,
          have back-ups ready.  That's
          never been more vital.  He
          must be able to hear me at
          every second and clearly.

     Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
     arm.

                    JANE
          We have twenty minutes -- you can
          wait in the studio.

     Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
     nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

     GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

     Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
     representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
     Mirage Fighter.

                    JANE
          Put in the radar plane that spotted
          them to begin with.

                    GRAPHIC ARTIST
          We have no pictures on file.

                    JANE
          I can't draw -- but this is a
          rough idea.

     She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
     an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
     stunning.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
     bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
     a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
     read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
     He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

     INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

     Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
     there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
     is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

     ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

                    GUARD
          I have to check first.

                    BUDDY
               (a bit frantic)
          Well, then check -- but hurry --
          There he is!!!

     Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
     gestures to slow down.

                    BUDDY
          Is everything all right?

                    TOM
          Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
          It's just that I'm going to anchor
          this special report on this Libyan
          thing...

                    BUDDY
               (delighted)
          Anchor?

                    TOM
               (amused despite
                situation)
          Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
          find out anything about what's
          happening.
               (on Buddy's reaction)
          What's wrong?

                    BUDDY
          I broke up with my roommate --
          He was really the magnet for
          everyone who knew anything.

                    TOM
          Oh.

                    BUDDY
          Look, I can start up with him again
          if you really...

                    TOM
          No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

     Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

                    BUDDY
          Good.  He's on the world's longest
          ego trip, let him take it alone.

                    TOM
          Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
          got to go to work.

                    BUDDY
               (to Tom)
          ...good-bye then.

                    TOM
          I'll speak to you.

                    BUDDY
          Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
          you what my favorite teacher ever,
          told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
          wonderful.'

     He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
     the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
     his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
     the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
     two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
     wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
     table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
     paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

     Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
     immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
     and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
     Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
     Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

     ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

     As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
     of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
     And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
     emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

                    BLAIR
               (sotto to Jane)
          Executive Producer -- wow.

     Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
     a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
     graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
     say, "This is a Special Report from..."

     INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

     Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
     her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
     marked "Tom."

                    JANE
          You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
          Damn it...He can't hear me...
               (to Blair)
          I told you if there was one thing...

     Tom's VOICE on speakers.

                    TOM
               (voice over; relaxed)
          I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

     Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
     the macho cool as:

     Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
     Announcer's last words clear.

                    ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
               (voice over)
          ...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

     He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
     in a low key way.  We trust him.

                    TOM
          Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
          plane attacked a United States
          Military Installation early this
          morning and was, itself, shot down
          by American F-14 Interceptors.

     Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
     men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
     non-business like.

                    MAN ONE
          Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
          is my brother, Stuart.

                    PAUL
          Not now!!!
               (gesturing)
          Look.

                    TOM
          The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
          Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
          earlier, had been crowded with 
          servicemen.  No one was injured.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
     a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
     SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
     providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

                    AARON
               (SINGING LOUDLY)
          And I can read while I sing.

     He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
     television on, the SOUND OFF.

     ON TV

     We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
     missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
     down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
     and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

                    TOM'S VOICE
               (voice over)
          The heat seeking missile virtually
          disintegrated the  plane on...

     Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

     INT. BOOTH

     Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

                    JANE
          George, you're ready.

     ON PENTAGON MONITOR

     We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

                    GEORGE
               (voice over)
          Should I cover everything or should
          I save something for Tom to ask about?

                    JANE
          Cover everything!

     George nods.

                    JANE
               (hitting Tom's button)
          We're going to George.  Say 'the
          Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
          George Weln at the Pentagon'.

     ON TOM

                    TOM
          George Weln is at the Pentagon where
          the attack launched by the lone
          Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
          movement of military might.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

                    AARON
          A lot of alliteration from anxious
          anchors placed in powerful posts.

     He picks up the phone.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     As Blair hands it to Jane.

                    BLAIR
          It's Aaron.

                    JANE
          Yes?

                    AARON
          I think the pilot that shot down the
          Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
          here.  Maybe you could get him --
          and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
          is one of the hardest planes to fly.
          They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

                    JANE
          Thanks.
               (to Tom)
          The F-14 is one of the most difficult
          planes to master.
               (remembering)
          Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
          the 70's the first crop had a number
          of crashes.

                    TOM
          George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
          the most difficult machines for a
          pilot to master?

                    GEORGE
          I think you're right -- it's certainly
          one of our hottest planes.

     INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

                    AARON
          I say it here -- it comes out there.

     He giggles.

                    TOM
               (voice over)
          There was trouble with them in the
          early days -- back in the 70's.

     Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
     White House.

                    AARON
               (into phone)
          Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
          foam at the mouth or anything.  When
          you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
          He seems like a leader -- very
          impressive, self-control...that's
          what's so strange.

     ON JANE

                    JANE
          Right and we have the '81
          pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
          will have him.

                    AARON
               (voice over)
          You're welcome.  Sow how does it
          feel to...I know you gotta go --
          Me too.  We're very busy here.

     He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
     The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

                    TOM
               (voice over)
          ...outlaw nation but strangely those
          who have interviewed Gaddafi find
          him, in a phrase we like to use in
          this country, very 'presidential'.

                    AARON
          Nice, Jane.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

     Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Just a minute.

     Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

                    JANE
               (to Tom)
          To State for the message from Libya,
          then you'll have the carrier pilot
          from the Sidra in time to...
               (a sudden shriek)
          What?  No!

     ON TOM

     Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

     BACK TO JANE

     As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
     is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

                    JANE
          We only have ten minutes left --
          how can you talk to me about parking
          problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
          do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
          ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

     As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

                    PAUL
               (sotto)
          I had no idea she was this good.

                    JANE
               (hitting Tom's button)
          Fill for a second.

                    TOM
               (fluidly)
          The latest message seems to indicate
          that the Libyan pilot was acting on
          his own without authority from anyone
          else.
               (into camera directly)
          In other words, I think we're okay.

     INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

     MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
     TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
     even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
     the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
     assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
     beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
     TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
     TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
     him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

                    TOM
          ...So, Commander, it must have been
          a bit tougher today -- shooting down
          the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
          you got was a SU-22...etc...

     And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
     and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
     vision.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

                    TOM'S VOICE
          ...Once again:  The Libyan Government
          has disavowed any prior knowledge of
          the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
          reporting from Washington.

     The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
     Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

                    PAUL
          He was brilliant.  I've never been
          as proud of one of my decisions.

                    ERNIE
               (calls back to Jane)
          Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
          Really.

     She nods... totally depleted.

                    JANE
          Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

     Ernie scoffs in her direction.

                    JANE
          Thanks, everybody.

     She exits the scene.

                    PAUL
               (to the Usher brothers)
          This was important for Tom -- there's
          that bonding thing that happens with
          the public and an anchorman during a
          crisis.  It's not the conventions
          anymore; it's this kind of moment.

     Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

                    PAUL
               (to Tom)
          What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

                    TOM
          Thanks.  With all the help you get,
          it's sure easier than local.

     Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

                    TOM (cont'd)
          Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

     Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

                    ERNIE
               (to the Usher brothers)
          Can I help you?

                    MARVIN
          We're here to play the new news theme.

                    ERNIE
          New theme?  You don't need me for this.

                    PAUL
          Stay.  Why should I be the only one
          to feel silly?

                    MAN ONE
          We need a synthesizer -- but this
          will give you an idea.

                    PAUL
          Go ahead.
               (to Ernie)
          Wasn't he great?

                    ERNIE
          It worked.

     Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
     news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
     composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
     that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

     INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

     As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
     enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
     the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

     INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

                    TOM
          You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
          having you inside my head.

                    JANE
               (a bit thrown)
          Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

                    TOM
          Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
          feed me the next thing, just a split 
          second before I needed it.  There was a 
          rhythm we got into, like great sex.

     Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
     truthfulness.

                    TOM
          You have to celebrate with me, don't
          you?  Everybody's going to that bar
          on the corner, 'Caps.'

                    JANE
          I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
          hoop up with all of you later.  How
          long do you think you'll be there?

     Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
     enters the elevator.

     EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

     As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
     been holding back on one question.

                    TOM
          It's tempting to ask you how you think
          I did.
               (she starts to reply)
          No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

     He starts across the street.

                    JANE
               (trying to be casual)
          Maybe I'll see you over there.

     Indicates Bar.

                    TOM
          You'll never show up.

     He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

                    TOM
          Jane?

                    JANE
          Yeah?

                    TOM
          I'll wait for you till seven.

                    JANE
               (shouting back)
          Okay.

     Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
     pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
     moving quickly along.

     SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
     through:

     EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

     As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
     stoop outside.

     ON AARON

     Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
     as she comes toward him.

                    JANE
          Really?  It was good.

     He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

                    JANE
          Your calling in that information --
          you're the classiest guy I know.

     He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

                    AARON
          It was strange to watch him.  What's
          the next step?  Lip synching?

     She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

                    AARON
          I've been doing some of the most
          important thinking of my life.  I
          wonder if this is the right time to
          tell you about it.

     She steals a glance at her watch.

                    JANE
          Well, whatever you think.

                    AARON
          I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
          hung up on getting a chance at weekend
          anchor...It's because if I do that well,
          they'll pay me more, treat me great and
          my life will be better.  That's why.

                    JANE
          Sounds like you may be on to something.

                    AARON
          Which means I'm at their mercy and who
          wants that?...I'm not going to tell
          you where this thought led me...
          Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
          it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
          all this I start to think about something
          that does nothing but make me feel good
          and makes immediate sense and that's you
          ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
          anything if you were two people so I could
          call up the one who's my friend and tell
          her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
          I should go any further.  Come on --
          I'll walk you to the corner.

     He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

                    JANE
          You know you've had a strange day...
          I'd sleep on all these things you've
          been thinking.

                    AARON
          Absolutely...You go have a good time...
          You have some place to go?

                    JANE
          Yes.

                    AARON
          Good.

     He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
     hands and kisses her full on the lips.

                    AARON
          Well, I felt something.

     He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

     ON JANE

     As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
     Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

     INT. CAB - EVENING

                    JANE
          We're going to Caps Bar at
          Seventeenth and Vermont;
          Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
          take that over to Fifteenth, then
          around Vermont and we'll bypass
          the circle that way...if you don't
          go over forty we should catch mostly
          green lights.

     ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

                    JANE
          Come on -- don't take it the
          wrong way.  I just know about
          things.

     He hits the meter.

     EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

     As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

                    DRIVER
          Great route.  I never made
          anywhere near that fast before.

                    JANE
          Thanks -- good driving --

                    DRIVER
          Thanks.  Coming from you I
          appreciate it.

                    JANE
          Thanks.

     As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
     As they confront each other:

                    TOM
          I didn't think you'd make it.

                    JANE
          Well, I thought I'd check if all
          of you were still here.  I'll just
          go in and join the gang and you
          two go on.

                    TOM
          There's no gang in there -- We
          were the last ones.

                    JANE
          Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

                    TOM
               (to Jennifer)
          Jennifer, you want to have another
          drink?

                    JANE
          Hey, I know how to have a burger by
          myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

                    JENNIFER
               (as they move off)
          I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
          work today.

                    JANE
               (too jock-like)
          Right back to you.

                    TOM
          Thanks for getting me through.

     He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
     camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
     inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
     the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

     ON TOM AND JENNIFER

     As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
     over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
     look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

     INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

     As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
     clothes even as they enter.

     INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

     We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

                    JENNIFER
               (intense shout)
          Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
          shit, you bastards...

     They finish.  A beat, then:

                    JENNIFER
          Sorry.

     ON TOM AND JENNIFER

     Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
     love to.

                    TOM
          No, it's okay...People say different
          things.  They do...the plural threw
          me.

     She laughs.

                    JENNIFER
          The last time I was with someone we
          went through this awful mutual disease
          questionnaire but I guess it beats
          getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
          I'll go first.  I haven't...

                    TOM
               (stopping her)
          It would never occur to me to worry
          at all about you.

     Jennifer is touched...

                    JENNIFER
          You know something?  I'm deeply
          complimented.   Isn't it strange to
          be deeply complimented because the
          man you're with doesn't think you
          have a venereal disease?...

     Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
     one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
     sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

                    JENNIFER
          Give me some of that.

     He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
     grin on his face.

                    TOM
          Where's the bathroom?

                    JENNIFER
          Through the closet.

     He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

     INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

     It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
     shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
     Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
     luggage.

     She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
     her.

                    JENNIFER
          I converted a bedroom -- this
          stuff builds up.  Wait till
          you've been doing this sixteen
          years.

                    TOM
          I'm not knocking it.  It's a
          great solution.  Not only the
          storage but you can see everything
          you have.

     Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
     silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

                    JENNIFER
          Do you do bunny rabbits?

     Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

                    TOM
          Isn't this a great date?

     We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

     INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

     Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
     and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
     STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
     realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
     to recognize in herself.

                    JANE
               (to herself)
          God help me.

     People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

                    AARON
          Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
          been here?

                    JANE
          A long time.  I was restless.
          Will you crack my neck?

     He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
     ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
     receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
     she utters a greeting.

                    JANE
          Aaah --
               (into phone)
          -- ello.  You sure they said the
          management meeting?
               (hangs up; then
                to Aaron)
          They want me to be at the
          management meeting.

                    AARON
          They're not that dumb, after all.

     He pats her on the back.

     INT. WALKWAY - DAY

                    BLAIR
          Do you know you're the second woman
          in network news history to produce?

                    JANE
               (though distracted)
          No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
          Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
          got that credit once on a U.N.
          special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

     INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

     Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
     TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
     discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
     division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
     her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

                    PAUL
          Anyway, they seem to be very serious
          about making me out eight million from
          the budget and that means massive firings.
          I'm doing everything I can... It's too
          early to make up a 'death list' but I
          just wanted you to be aware of the
          situation... We're also going to cover
          the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
          continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
          of Washington which means we've got to
          get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
          We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

     She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

                    PAUL (cont'd)
          This is going to be high-profile on
          the Evening News -- who do you think?
          George Weln or Jennifer?

                    JANE
               (much, much too quickly)
          Jennifer.

     The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
     rationally.

                    JANE (cont'd)
          Jennifer.

     INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
     appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
     she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

                    JANE
          Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
          There's a big thing over at the
          Italian embassy.

                    TOM
          I'm not sure I'd be good
          company tonight.

                    JANE
               (self-conscious joke)
          I'll be the judge of that.

     INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

     As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
     recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
     herself.  A small knot of people form.

                    JANE
          It's much too soon for you to have
          this kind of buzz around you.

                    TOM
          Do I have to stand here in the middle
          and meet them all?

                    JANE
          I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
               (she pushes him
                a little)
          And smile and move...

     They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
     But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

                    EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
          Is it safe for me to fly home?

                    TOM
          Yes.  We're fine now.

                    JANE
          AND SMILE.

     He smiles -- people smile back.

                    JANE
          AND MOVE.

     ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

     Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
     stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
     of appetizers.

                    MARTIN KLEIN
          The Italians serve the second best
          things right after the Chinese...I
          could do an article comparing Embassy
          food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
          anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
          assignments.

                    AARON
          Who the heck could that be?

     AARON'S P.O.V.

     From the excited group of people blocking his view,
     it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

     ON AARON

     And now he sees that it's Tom.

                    AARON
          Is God testing me or something?

                    MARTIN KLEIN
          Paul loves him.  I heard him give
          him the most poetic compliment in
          his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
          groups of executives get together just
          to say that work back and forth...'He's
          hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
          hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
               (looking at Aaron)
          And here we are.

                    AARON
          Martin, you're not allowed to use the
          word 'we' or I'm moving.

                    MARTIN KLEIN
               (sudden thought)
          Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
          a spot...Try the one in the middle.

     He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
     stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

                    TOM
          Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

                    AARON
          Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
          who won three Overseas Press Awards
          pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

     A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

                    TOM
          You want to go out there --
               (indicating balcony)
          get out of this for a second?

                    AARON
          Why don't you lead?  I'll just
          follow the flurry you cause.

     Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

                    TOM
          What did I do to you?

                    AARON
          You've made my dreams silly.

     Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
     hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
     terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
     stare at the party.

                    TOM
               (gesturing at the
                  party)
          Heavy hitters.

     Aaron nods.

     They look inside.

                    AARON
               (several beats; then)
          How you doing?

                    TOM
               (warming)
          Great.  Network news, Washington...
          I love it.  What do you do when your
          real life exceeds your dreams?

                    AARON
          Keep it to yourself.

                    TOM
          You know the other day I really wanted
          your reaction to how we did with the
          Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
          I guess I feel a little intimidated with
          you.

                    AARON
          Oh, stop it.

     On Tom's reaction.

                    AARON
          You can't talk about feeling
          intimidated when you're on top of
          the world.  It's unseemly.

                    TOM
          I'm not buying into any of that.  I
          have a load to learn.  I'm not going
          to act as if...

                    AARON
               (finishing for him)
          You have the job you have...

     The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
     fast for him.

                    TOM
          Shut up a second...

                    AARON
               (amiably)
          Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
          it, pal?

                    TOM
               (picking his words)
          I made one rule for myself when this
          started and I realized I was going
          to take a lot from you people because
          of being from sports...

                    AARON
          And the rule was...

                    TOM
          Never to pretend to know more than
          I did.

                    AARON
          Can you name all the members of the
          Cabinet?

                    TOM
               (flustered)
          Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
          I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
          that came up in conversation I'd...

                    AARON
          We're conversing...Oh my, the names
          of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
          mind.  What are they?

     Tom is getting pissed.

                    AARON
               (compromising)
          Don't name them.  Just tell me if
          you know.

                    TOM
          Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
          the Cabinet.

                    AARON
          Okay.

     A beat.

                    AARON (cont'd)
          All twelve?

                    TOM
          Yes.

                    AARON
          There are only ten.

     Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
     isn't a little infectious.

                    TOM
          You're feeling good, aren't you?

                    AARON
               (sincerely)
          I'm starting to... We may do
          the capitols of the states.

                    TOM
               (dry)
          Fifty, right?

     Aaron almost smiles.

     Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

     LONG SHOT

     Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
     Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

     EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

     As Tom's car comes to a stop.

     INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

                    TOM
          I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
          tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
          I'm just a dead lump of poured out
          flesh.
               (then)
          Would you like to come up?

     Tom thinks -- then:

                    TOM
          Maybe we could just sit here --
          talk a little?

                    JANE
          Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

                    TOM
          Too many smart people in one room --
          it's not healthy...

     Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

                    TOM
          I'm going to have to do a story
          from beginning to end on my own.

                    JANE
          Eventually.  Does it have to be
          right now?

                    TOM
               (nodding)
          Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
          unless it was absolutely necessary.
          I have an idea for something.

                    JANE
          What?

                    TOM
          I just read about it in a magazine
          and it affected me.

                    JANE
          Well, what is it?

                    TOM
          If I tell you, can you manage not
          to put it down or tell me why it
          won't work or is in bad journalistic
          taste or anything like that?

                    JANE
               (broadly)
          Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

     He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

                    JANE (cont'd)
          I promise.

                    TOM
          It's about women who are attacked
          by someone they know on a date...
          'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
          Well?

     Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

                    TOM
          Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

     She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
     opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
     She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
     behind her door and runs for it.

     ON TOM

     His spirits lifted.

     ON JANE

     Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

     INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
     turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
     instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
     Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
     sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

                    JANE
          Hello.

                    TO
               (uncertain)
          Hello?

                    JANE
          Hello...Who is it?

     INTERCUT:

     INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                    TOM
          I'm not sure I dialed right --
          Jane?

                    JANE
          Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
          Is this Tom?

                    TOM
          Yes.

                    JANE
          I had to sleep fast so I took two
          allergy pills to help me...I'm
          sorry...Hey, you called me.

                    TOM
          It's not important.

                    JANE
          Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
          I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
          tell -- how embarrassing for me.
          Gosh.

                    TOM
          What pills did you take?  You
          sound more like someone on a general
          anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
          to you tomorrow.

                    JANE
          Nooo.  Is it your story?

                    TOM
          No.  Are you going to the
          Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

                    JANE
          Why, you need me for the story?

                    TOM
          No.  Were you going to you?

                    JANE
          Uh-huh.

                    TOM
          Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
          to go.

                    JANE
          Oh, good.

                    TOM
          We can go together.


                    JANE
          So you like me, huh?

                    TOM
          I like you as much as I can like
          anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

     INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

     Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
     table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
     he looks at the piece he has written.

                    TOM
               (reading)
          But cops on the street continue to
          view it as...
          Shit -- too long.  But street cops
          say...that fits.  That last cut work
          for you, Bobbie?

                    BOBBIE
          Yes, and thanks for asking.

     INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

     As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
     Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
     out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
     face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

     ON MONITOR

                    UNIFORMED COP
          What can you do?  If a woman invites
          a man in and he says they uh, had
          sex and she says he raped her and
          then you find out they've been out
          together two, three times...how can
          you prove a crime?

     NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

     Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
     looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
     of "Glass Menagerie."

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          It will be a year next month since it
          happened...I never thought I'd talk
          about it outside of counseling...

     ON NEWSROOM

     As Aaron enters the scene.

                    AARON
          Hi.

     He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
     up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

     ON MONITOR

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
          enjoyed myself that much but it gets
          to a point -- I don't know if you can
          appreciate this but where you don't
          want to sit home or be with your
          girlfriends and people had always been
          telling me that I was 'too picky.'
          I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
          a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
          'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
          wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
          to a movie and when he brought me home
          he said could he just come up and have
          one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
          say 'no', to that?  So first it was
          this wrestling match which was awful
          enough because it got to be really
          a fight...because I'm a modest person...
          then he ripped my clothes and he 
          forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
          my apartment and forced me more times
          -- he didn't leave until...
               (she has started to cry)
          I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
          It's just hard not to --
               (ruefully)
          You sure have a sympathetic face.
               (she cries a bit more)
          ...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
          but the whole thing messed me up --
          maybe more than it should...

     ON MONITOR

     As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
     from his eyes.

     ON NEWSROOM

     These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
     is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

                    AARON
          Can I turn on the news for a second?
          ...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
          This must be the news.

     Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
     monitor.

     ON MONITOR

                    PUBLIC OFFICIAL
          I don't think you can overestimate it --
          on any given Saturday night tens of
          thousands of women are being attacked
          and there isn't much they or we can do
          about it...

                    TOM
               (on monitor)
          The victims often remain too terrified
          to talk -- the police powerless and all
          the social welfare groups can finally do
          is monitor this epidemic of crime without
          punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
          Annandale, Virginia.

     As his piece concludes.

     NEWSROOM

     Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

                    AARON
          I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

                    TOM
          What's wrong with it?

                    AARON
          Nothing.  I think you really blew
          the lid off nookie.

     Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
     to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

     MONITOR

     We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
     of people watching them work.

     ON JANE

     Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
     towards a positive stance.

                    JANE
               (to Tom)
          Nice work...
               (checks watch)
          I've got to get a crew off the clock.

     She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

     ON TOM AND JANE

     Now off a bit by themselves.

                    TOM
          So what did you think?

                    JANE
          It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
          really did.  It was unusual for you to
          cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
          that might not have been my choice...but
          it's real and it got me...and I think a
          lot of the time I'm too conservative about
          that kind of stuff.  Okay?

                    TOM
               (enormously pleased)
          Yeah.

     He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

     INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

                    BLAIR
          Ernie's been looking for you.

     As Aaron walks to his office.

     INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

     As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

                    ERNIE
          Oh, I was just writing you a note.
          What do you say we take a walk?

                    AARON
               (puzzled)
          Outside?

                    ERNIE
          Yeah --

     EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

     Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
     form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

                    ERNIE
          I don't know if we have any
          younger man more respected in our
          operation than you.

                    AARON
          Just tell me what's really going
          on.  I think we know each other
          well enough for me to expect that.

                    ERNIE
               (agitated)
          We know each other well enough
          for me to care how I put something
          to you which could wipe you out.
          So I will phrase things the way I
          think they should be phrased.  All
          right?

                    AARON
          Wipe me out?

     Ernie sits on a bench.

                    ERNIE
          Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

                    AARON
          Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
          appreciate bluntness.

                    ERNIE
          Upper management thinks you're dull.

     Aaron deflates.

                    ERNIE
          Aaron, I've never seen them like
          this -- I think Paul's nervous
          about his own job and for some
          reason he thinks you only appeal to...

                    AARON
          Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
          beginning to appreciate it.

                    ERNIE
          I'm no suggesting the worst will
          happen...but someone with your
          brilliance gets nibbles about other
          jobs and maybe, the next time that
          happens, down the road -- you should
          look into it.

                    AARON
               (emotional)
          Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
          God.  They want to fire me.

                    ERNIE
          All I know is that they've got to
          fire a large number of people...
          and they're not going by seniority.
          There's a recklessness in the air.  
          They...

                    AARON
               (interrupting)
          Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
          at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
          never seen me do it.  I think it could
          turn them around.

                    ERNIE
          I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
          wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

     Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

                    AARON
          Do it then.

                    ERNIE
          Please prepare carefully.  This
          couldn't come at a better time.

                    AARON
          Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
          news handy?

                    ERNIE
          It's been a while since you read
          the news -- I'll have somebody work
          with you.  Just on superficial
          performance things.

     Several beats.

                    ERNIE (cont'd)
          Please.

                    AARON
          Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
          for a while.

                    ERNIE
          I understand.  I'll go with you.

                    AARON
          Thanks.

     INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
     his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
     is standing a few feet further back studying him.

                    AARON
          This is uncomfortable for me --
          because, well, I don't mean it as
          a knock, but we approach this
          differently.

                    TOM
          We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
          knock either.
               (he smiles)
          Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
          and you can disregard it if you want.

                    AARON
          It just might not work for me because
          of our different approaches.

     Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
     the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

                    TOM
          Wait.

                    AARON
          What?

                    TOM
          Your coat jacket is rising up in 
          back.

     Aaron ignores the tip.

                    TOM
          When you sit down -- sit on your
          jacket a little -- that gives you
          a good line.  Look at yourself in
          the monitor.

     Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
     Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
     behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

                    AARON
               (very uncomfortable)
          I don't like being handled.

                    TOM
          Sit on it!  Now look.

                    AARON
          Just don't physically...
               (he sees himself in the
                monitor and is suddenly
                 enthusiastic)
          Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

     He starts to read again.

                    TOM
          No.  That's not going to tell us
          anything.  Let's get this prompter
          going.

                    AARON
          It's not loaded.

                    TOM
          I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

     Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
     genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
     helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
     tow.

                    TOM
          I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
          the camera and I got Master Control
          taping so you can study it later.

     He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

                    AARON
          Hey, Tom...

     Tom turns.

                    AARON
          I'm very appreciative.

     SAME SCENE - LATER

     Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
     various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

                    TOM
          No.  No.

                    AARON
          No?

                    TOM
          Don't let your eyes go from the
          beginning of the sentence to the end
          like that.  You don't want to look
          shifty, do you?

                    AARON
          Oh, God, no!

                    TOM
          And the left side of your face is the
          good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
          one word or phrase in every sentence --
          punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
          on --

     Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

                    TOM
          Good...very nice.

     Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
     first words.

                    AARON
          Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

     He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
     next story.

                    TOM
          Try not to move your head or wrinkle
          your forehead...this is good, very
          good...

     EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

     Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
     his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

                    TOM
          You were smokin' toward the end there.

                    AARON
          The pointers were great.  I'll study
          the tape.

     Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
     room pep talk:

                    TOM
          And remember -- you're not just reading
          the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
          sell a little.  You're selling them this
          idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
          of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
          credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
          just reading...stop and start selling a
          little.  So long.

     He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
     uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

     INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
     pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
     late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
     it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
     gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
     RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
     Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
     of neckties.

                    AARON
          I spilled some rum on the outfit you
          picked out.  Let me show you the
          alternates.

     She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

                    JANE
               (into phone)
          Tom...why don't I meet you there?
          I've got some last minute stuff I've
          got to take care of...Hey, how did
          you resolve your dilemma -- did you
          rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
          How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
          there...

                    AARON
          I didn't know you were going with him.

                    JANE
          Did you bring your grey suit?

                    AARON
          Yes...I was thinking that way too...
          Which tie?

     She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
     she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
     over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
     collection.

                    JANE
               (the clasp in place)
          Thanks.  Try this one.

     She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
     puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
     full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
     built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
     the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

                    JANE
          I read about it -- that's how you can
          make sure you don't put on too much
          perfume...

                    AARON
          Could you at least pretend that this
          is an awkward situation for you --
          me showing up while you're getting
          ready for a date.

                    JANE
               (flaring)
          It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
          to a professional conclave.

     Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
     of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

     EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

     Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
     of a taxi stand.

                    JANE
               (on phone)
          How long will it tale you to send
          one?...

     She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

                    JANE
          You look terrific.

     Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

                    AARON
          Really?

     Jane nods.

                    AARON
          Because this is important -- so don't
          just be polite.  I'd really like to
          look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

                    JANE
          As good as humanly possible.

                    AARON
          Yes.

                    JANE
          Well, the line of the jacket -- No
          really....just very nice...just right.
          I wish I could be there.

                    AARON
          Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
          before 11:00, drop by the studio.

                    JANE
          I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

                    AARON
          If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
          wait for you at my apartment.

                    JANE
          Okay, great -- good luck.

     Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

                    AARON
          Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

                    JANE
          You too.

     Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

                    AARON
          I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
          either of us?

     She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
     from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
     shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
     his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

     AARON'S P.O.V.

     Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
     instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
     turns and walks off.

     INT. CAB - NIGHT

     Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

     EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

     A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
     men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
     they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

     INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

     As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
     the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
     A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

                    MAN ONE
          The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
          severance pay in the business.

     Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
     his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

                    MAN THREE
          He was lecturing me and finally
          I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
          to look at it as a negative that
          I'm young and my news appeals to
          people my age.

                    WOMAN
          And it's not like he just didn't
          hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
          himself.

                    MAN
          No kidding, twenty-six.

     Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
     people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
     conversations of both substance and expedience.

                    ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
          Remember Brinkley's great line
          -- "It's as irrevocable as a
          haircut."

     Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

     JANE'S P.O.V.

     The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
     of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
     as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
     women's pulses throb.

     ON JANE

     As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
     and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
     with the gods.

                    JANE
               (to herself)
          If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
          supposed to be together.

     ON TOM

     Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
     meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
     boyfriend.

     ON JANE

     Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
     joyous pretty young woman.

     ON TOM

     Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

                    TOM
               (excitedly)
          It's incredible who's here.

                    JANE
          Who?

                    TOM
          Me!

     She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
     his arm instead.

     INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

     Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
     takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
     to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

                    AARON
          Want to look at this?

                    W.N.P.
          Sure.

     George Weln appears...

                    GEORGE
               (to Aaron)
          What are you doing here?

                    AARON
               (feigning casualness)
          The weekend news...anchoring...
          anchoring the weekend news.

                    GEORGE
          Way to go.

     Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

                    W.N.P.
          This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
          a pleasure to read.

                    AARON
          Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
          isn't there, in case I get an attack
          of cotton mouth.

                    W.N.P.
          Sure.  You'll be fine.

                    AARON
               (feeling patronized
                  and repelling)
          I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
     the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
     through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
     Tom several couples back.

                    OFF-CAMERA VOICE
               (o.s.)
          Can I have your autograph for my wife?

     Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

                    TOM
          How you doing, Paul?

                    PAUL
          So this is why you wouldn't do the
          Weekend New, you can't turn down
          a free meal.

                    TOM
          Yes, born to party.

     Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
     herself.

                    PAUL
          I'll see you two inside -- I think
          we're all at the same table.
               (sotto to Jane)
          You're finally learning to be flexible.
          Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

     He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
     she pulls him back.

                    JANE
          I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
          there and sit with everybody.
               (imagining it)
          I can't...why don't you go?

     He considers this option as she waits.

                    TOM
          Suppose I go in for a little while and
          you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

                    JANE
          Good.  That's it...See you.

     She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

                    TOM
          Jane.

     She turns.

                    TOM
          You're not going to take off on
          me, are you?

                    JANE
          Uh-uh.

     She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
     anxiety flows.

     ON TOM

     Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
     simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

     FULL SHOT

     Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
     past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

                    TOM
          I just want you to know that my
          giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
          puts tremendous pressure on you.

     Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
     threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
     the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
     hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

     INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

     WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
     the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
     ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
     machine.

                    FLOOR MANAGER
          Twenty seconds.

     ON AARON

     Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
     at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
     off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
     footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
     on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
     them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

                    FLOOR MANAGER
          Ten seconds.

                    AARON
          How many?

                    FLOOR MANAGER
          Ten.

                    AARON
          Okay.

     He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
     resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
     been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
     in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
     "...with Aaron Altman."

                    AARON
               (on TV)
          Good Evening...In mood and language
          better suited to an espionage novel
          than the delicate world of the Western
          Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
          today pounced on what he termed, 'The
          nest of profession spies and amateur
          traitors who were turning NATO
          Headquarters into an instrument whose
          only true function is folly.'  We begin
          our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

     Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
     punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
     has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
     He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
     brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
     beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
     then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

                    MAKEUP WOMAN
          Gee whiz.

                    FLOOR MANAGER
          Five seconds.

     She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
     box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
     section appears behind him.

                    AARON
          ...the sub-bases referred to are
          located in five countries...

     And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
     Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
     as they look at a large monitor.

                    AARON
          France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
          Spain as...

     And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
     pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
     Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
     Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

                    AARON
          We well as Great Britain...Our own
          State Department was rocked not only
          by the revelation but from the highly
          unusual persistence from the State 
          Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
          the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

     Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
     showing distinct sweat stains...

                    AARON
          Help me.

     The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
     better of it...

                    MAKEUP WOMAN
          Someone finds me some big towels.

     ON AARON

     He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

                    FLOOR MANAGER
          Five seconds.

     ON MAKEUP WOMAN

     As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
     trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
     talking to his Camera Operators.

                    DIRECTOR
          I'd go looser but we wouldn't
          see the graphic.

                    TECHNICIAN
               (to other Technician)
          No -- this is more than Nixon ever
          sweated.

     The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

                    MAKEUP WOMAN
          Can't you just die for him?

     ON MONITOR

     Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

     EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

     Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
     They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
     and then sits next to her.

                    TOM
          You okay?

                    JANE
          Great.

     FULL SHOT

     REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
     abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
     night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
     now he notes this.

                    TOM
               (loudly to himself)
          Why can't I let go of this woman?

                    JANE
          Well...

     He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
     swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
     air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
     before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
     to look at her.

                    JANE
          At least kiss me when you do
          that.

                    TOM
               (a grin)
          You just can't stop editing me.
          Huh?

                    JANE
          This is hysterical.

     She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
     surprised and aroused and look at each other...

                    JANE
          I was half hoping I wouldn't
          have a good time tonight.  You
          know why?

                    TOM
          Because you're nuts.

                    JANE
          Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
          tease?

     He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

                    TOM
          More and more lately when I've
          watched you in action -- seen all
          your energy -- I've been
          wondering what it would be like
          to be inside all that energy.

     She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
     on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

                    JANE
          Right back at you.

     Several beats.

                    TOM
          I don't remember saying anything
          like that -- exactly...I don't
          know why I just did.

                    JANE
               (immediately at work)
          Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
          I can think of two reasons.

                    TOM
          What?

                    JANE
          Three...I just thought of a third...
          If you talk about it, you don't have
          to do it.

                    TOM
          That's not it.

                    JANE
          Good...Another is you're trying to
          make it all about sex and heat and
          nothing else.

     She looks at him -- he's thinking.

                    JANE
          Or it's that great feeling that you
          don't want to hold anything back.
          You know, intimacy.

     She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

                    JANE
               (suddenly)
          Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

     She moves off the concrete wall.

                    JANE
          I forgot all about Aaron.  I
          promised to stop by and see
          how he did.

                    TOM
          I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

                    JANE
          No.  I'll see you at your apartment
          as soon as I can.

     She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
     out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
     of his actions has been tinged with fury.

                    TOM
          JANE!

     Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

                    JANE
          What happened?

                    TOM
          Don't run off --  like everything's
          settled the minute you make up your
          mind.

                    JANE
          He might be weird -- he can talk more
          freely if I go alone -- why's that so
          hard to understand?

                    TOM
          It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
          to give me a minute to catch up.

                    JANE
          Okay.
               (she hugs him)
          Sorry.
               (another beat)
          Don't yell at me like that again,
          you scared the life out of me.

     EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

     It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
     RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
     and cords.

                    AARON
          I was in the shower.

     She enters.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                    JANE
          How'd it go?

                    AARON
          You didn't see it or speak to
          anybody?

                    JANE
          No.

                    AARON
          Then it went well.

                    JANE
          Did it really go well?

                    AARON
          Define your terms.

                    JANE
          Do you feel good about it?

                    AARON
          No.

                    JANE
          Do others feel that you did well?

                    AARON
          No.

                    JANE
          Then what was good about it?

                    AARON
          I lost six pounds...

                    JANE
          Aaron, will you tell me?

                    AARON
          It was great...writing my little
          first rate copy, sitting on my
          jacket, punching my one thought.
          But I had this historic attack of
          flop sweat so they'll never let
          me another again.  Oh, I lost one
          of your shoulder pads -- how was
          your evening anyway?

                    JANE
          What do you mean, flop sweat? --
          you're making too much out of
          it...I'll bet you were the only
          one aware of it...

                    AARON
          People phoned in.

                    JANE
          Stop kidding.  I want to know
          what happened.

                    AARON
          I'm not kidding.

                    JANE
          There were complaining phone calls
          because you were sweating?

                    AARON
          No, nice ones worried that I was
          having a heart attack.

                    JANE
          If all that happened, how come you're
          so chipper?

                    AARON
          I don't know.  At a certain point
          it was so off the chart bad --
          it got funny.  My central nervous
          system was telling me something.
          Jane -- sweat running down my face --
          makeup falling into my eyes -- people
          turning this fusillade of blow dryers
          on me -- all so I could read
          introductions to other people who
          were covering stories which is
          what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
          chipper because you finally showed
          up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
          Tequila and eggs sound good?

                    JANE
          I have to be somewhere.

     He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

                    JANE
          I told what's his name -- Tom --
          that I'd meet him.

                    AARON
          Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
          right?

                    JANE
               (now the plunge)
          I don't know.  I may be in love
          with him.

                    AARON
               (as if he just burned
                his hand)
          No!!!!!

     She starts for the door.

                    AARON
          Don't go.

                    JANE
          This is important to me.

                    AARON
          Yeah.  Well...I think it is
          important for you too.  Sit down.

     She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

                    JANE
          What?

                    AARON
               (looking at her)
          Let me think a second.  It's
          tough.

     A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
     it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
     into himself.

                    AARON
          Aaach...Jane...
               (glancing at note)
          Let's take the part that has
          nothing to do with me.  Let's let
          me be your most trusted friend,
          the one that gets to say awful
          things to you.  You know?

                    JANE
               (testy and wary
                but fair)
          Yes, I guess.  Yes.

                    AARON
          You can't end up with Tom because
          it goes totally against everything
          you're about.

                    JANE
          Yeah -- being a basket case.

                    AARON
          I know you care about him.  I've
          never seen you like this about
          anyone, so please don't take it
          wrong when I tell you that I believe
          that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
          the Devil.

                    JANE
               (quickly)
          This isn't friendship.

                    AARON
          What do you think the Devil is going
          to look like if he's around?  Nobody
          is going to be taken in if he has a
          long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
          semi-serious here.  He will look
          attractive and he will be nice and
          helpful and he will get a job where
          he influences a great God-fearing
          nation and he will never do an evil
          thing...he will just bit by little bit
          lower standards where they are important.
          Just coax along flash over substance...
          Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
          all of us really being salesmen.
               (seeing he's not
                reaching her)
          And he'll get all the great women.

     She is getting pissed.

                    JANE
          I think you're the Devil.

                    AARON
          No.  You know that I'm not.

                    JANE
          How?

                    AARON
          Because we have the kind of
          relationship where if I were the
          Devil, you'd be the only one I
          told.

     She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

                    JANE
          You were quick enough to get
          Tom's help when...

                    AARON
          Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
          if it had gone well for me tonight,
          maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
          this...I grant you everything but
          give me this...he does personify
          everything you've been fighting
          against...And I'm in love with you.
               (realizing)
          How do you like that? -- I buried
          the lead.

     He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
     nose.

                    AARON
               (an aside)
          I've got to not say that aloud;
          it takes too much out of me.

                    JANE
               (thawing)
          Sit down, stop.

     Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

                    AARON
          I've never fought for anyone before.
          Does anybody win one of these things?

     INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
     window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
     looks out.

     TOM'S P.O.V.

     A woman walking from a car.

     ON TOM

     Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

     TOM'S P.O.V.

     It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

     INTERCUT:

     BACK TO SCENE

     As he answers and we have the following conversation between
     Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
     away.  Tom in his apartment.

                    JANE
          Hi.  It's me.

                    TOM
          Where are you?

                    JANE
          I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
          at Aaron's.

                    TOM
          Well, when?

                    JANE
          I'm not sure.  It seems like he
          had sort of a mishap on the news.

                    TOM
          I know.  I taped it.

                    JANE
          It wasn't as bad as he think, was
          it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
          anything?

                    TOM
          Not if you count 'Singing in the
          Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
          treat it like a tragedy.  You want
          me to talk to him?

     Her eyes meet Aaron's.

                    JANE
          Uh-uh.
               (to Aaron)
          He says you could hardly notice it.

     Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
     so:

                    JANE
          Don't say anything about anything.

                    AARON
          Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

                    TOM
          Everybody has one like that.  I
          thought it was great when you
          started to laugh at the end.

                    AARON
          Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
          up Jane, I didn't realize you two
          would be going this late.  Sorry.

                    TOM
          No.  Don't worry about it.

                    AARON
          I'll put her on.

     She takes the phone.

                    JANE
          Hi, again.  Sorry about...

                    TOM
          No.  That sounds more important.
          Let's forget about tonight.

                    JANE
          I don't know if that's absolutely
          necessary.

                    TOM
          I've got my father coming through
          tomorrow anyway.  I should get
          some sleep.

                    JANE
               (hampered by Aaron's
                presence)
          Uh-huh.

                    TOM
          I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

     Several beats of silence.  Finally:

                    TOM
               (finally)
          Hello?

                    JANE
          Yes.

                    TOM
          Okay.  Good night.

                    JANE
               (aghast)
          Good night??!

                    TOM
          Jane, I'm not some chore you have
          to finish so you can stay on schedule.

                    JANE
          Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
          now -- huh?  Good night.

      She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
     looks at her.

                    JANE
          He just cancelled.  He had a
          chance to think and he
          cancelled.

     She bows her head.

                    JANE
          I can't breathe.
               (aghast)
          Over a guy?!?
               (then)
          But I can't -- I can't breathe.
          Damn it!

     She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
     another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

                    AARON
          Well, Jane, it was nice of you
          to drop by.

     INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

     ON PHONE...

     Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
     one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
     Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
     She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
     tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
     HEAR a busy signal.

     ON JANE

     She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
     button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
     a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

                    JANE
               (stopping herself)
          Be fair.

     She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
     Busy.

     EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

     As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
     door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

                    WIFE
          Ernie, they're calling from work.

                    ERNIE
          Tell me I'm on the way in.

                    WIFE
          It's Paul.

     Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
     four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

     INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

     A phone in the immaculate living room.

                    ERNIE
               (into phone)
          Hello.  Yes...

     He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
     himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

                    ERNIE
          Would there be any point to my going     
          to New York and talking to them?  Would
          there be any point in going over it with
          you?  No, I'm still coming in.

     He hangs up.

                    WIFE
          What?

                    ERNIE
          They fired me.

     She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

                    WIFE
               (weeping)
          How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
          be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
          go for a drive, have some drinks, make
          happy plans.

                    ERNIE
          No.  They're firing even more people
          than they said.  Some will want to
          talk.  It could help.

                    WIFE
               (timidly)
          I could use somebody to talk to on
          a day like this.
               (on his reaction)
          Sorry. Go ahead.

     He kisses her sad face.

                    ERNIE
          Bye, sweetie.

                    WIFE
          Okay, sweetie.

     He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
     tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

     HIS P.O.V.

     In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
     back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

     Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
     rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
     the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
     an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

                    BLAIR
          I've got four hours of French
          demonstrations --

     Jane waves it off.

                    BLAIR
          Some of it they use water cannons.

     Jane takes the tape.

                    JANE
          What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
          that's right -- because the Evening
          News is here this week.

                    BLAIR
          I spent a fortune on this.

     Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
     timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
     door.

     JANE'S P.O.V.

     The door now closed.

     JANE

     She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

     office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

                    JANE
               (without passion)
          I kept trying to call you -- you
          never called me.  Were you just
          diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
          great if I'm helping your career.
               (mimicking)
          But when I'm a woman for a second, I
          get immediately fucked around by
          you.

     She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's

     INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

                    TOM
          Jane, this is my Dad.

     And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
     seated across from him.

                    JANE
               (that quickly)
          Please forgive what I said.
               (to Tom)
          Sorry.

     As she retreats:

                    TOM
          You just light up a room and leave,
          huh?

     She laughs nervously as she exits.

     TOM AND HIS DAD

                    DAD
          You want my opinion?

                    TOM
          The thing that's easy to miss about
          Jane is...

                    DAD
          You want my opinion?  And it's okay
          if you don't.

     Tom thinks a beat.

                    TOM
          Yes, I would.

                    DAD
          The way she just acted is not the
          way an affectionate person acts.

     Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
     provoking.

     INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

     Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
     the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
     and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
     grace and dignity,

     He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
     muted and ominous.

                    BILL
          Just when do you start, telling people?

                    PAUL
          Almost immediately.

                    BILL
          I'd like to take everyone out after
          the show.

                    PAUL
          Bill...This is hard on all of us
          and it's no time for compliments.
          But I think it's extraordinary of
          you to come down here for this.

                    BILL
          If we're not here for each other
          during the tough time, we're not a
          news organization.

     Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
     but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
     outfit.

                    BLAIR
          Welcome back to Washington.

                    BILL
          Thanks.

     A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

                    BILL
          I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

     Paul nods "yes."

                    BILL
          This is a brutal layoff...And all
          because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

                    PAUL
               (can't resist)
          You can make it a little less brutal
          by knocking a million dollars or so off
          your salary.

     AS Bill turns:

                    PAUL
          Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
          It's a miserable day and that was
          some kind of totally sick-joke
          defense mechanism which does not
          indicate any of my feelings -- not
          one -- but just shows the kind of
          stress this represents for all of us.

     Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
     walks to Tom.

                    BILL
          Hi.  It's about time.

                    TOM
          Good to see you, Bill.

     AS they shake:

     INSERT

     A great handshake.

     ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

     touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
     greet his son.

                    TOM
          This is my father.

                    BILL
          Good to meet you, sir.

     ON TOM

     Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
     journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

                    MR. GRUNICK
          Good-bye, Tom.

     He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
     whispers in his ear.

                    MR. GRUNICK
          I'm going to go back home and tell
          all your old teachers.

     Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
     editing room.

     INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

     AS Tom enters...

                    JANE
          I feel terrible about what happened.
          What did he say?

                    TOM
          He -- uh -- said he liked you because
          you looked like you had -- fire and
          honesty.

                    JANE
               (enormously pleased)
          No.  Did he really?

                    TOM
          Yes.  Then he said a really weird
          thing...

                    JANE
               (so softly)
          What?

                    TOM
               (he means this)
          That it would be a treat to make
          someone like you feel better...
          He gets like that sometimes.

                    JANE
          That's so perfectly...It really
          makes me feel a little faint...
               (actually woozy)
          Whooo.

     Blair enters wildly into the scene.

                    BLAIR
          They canned me.  Well, my brother
          will feel great -- now he's not the
          only screw-up.

                    JANE
          It's started.

     Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

                    BOBBIE
          Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

     AS Tom focuses and moves off:

     INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

     Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
     proceeds down the hallway.

     INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

                    SECRETARY
          He'll just be a minute.

     Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
     opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

                    MARTIN KLEIN
          You know I'm just old enough to be
          flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

                    PAUL
          That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
          If there's anything I can do.

     They shake.

                    MARTIN KLEIN
               (evenly)
          I certainly hope you die soon.

     A little smile to Tom and he's off.

                    PAUL
          Tom.

     Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
     crosses to a seat.

                    PAUL
          We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
          17 people in this bureau including
          technical personnel and we're going
          to reorganize at the same time.
          We're going to take you out of Washington
          for a while and assign you to London.

     INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

     Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
     are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
     from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

                    ANONYMOUS VOICE
          No.  I won't keep my voice down.
          Those sons-of-bitches...They are
          worse than accountants -- they
          are bad accountants.

     Tom enters scene.

                    TOM
          Have you guys seen Jane?

                    ERNIE
          She's in there becoming the first
          woman bureau chief we've had here.

     Tom takes this in.

                    AARON
          What did they do with you?

                    TOM
          They booted me out of Washington.

                    AARON
          Impossible.  There's no system that
          wouldn't value one of us.

                    TOM
          Why?  What did they do to you?

                    ERNIE
               (pointing at Aaron)
          It's what he did.  I'm proud of
          him.

                    AARON
          They told me they'd keep me because
          they could plug me into any story
          and my salary was in line.

                    ERNIE
          The cost-efficient reporter.

                    AARON
          So I quit.

     A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
     Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
     the same sword.

                    TOM
          You packing up tonight?

                    AARON
          Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
          sending you down for a while, but
          you'll make it back...Where they
          sending you?

                    TOM
          London.

                    AARON
               (incensed)
          London.  That's a promotion!

                    TOM
               (defensively)
          I don't think so.

                    AARON
          It is.  Yes -- that's where they
          had Rorish, for God's sake, before
          they made him anchor.  I can't stand
          it -- they're grooming you for it
          all and you don't even know it.

                    TOM
          Hold it down, okay?

                    AARON
          Can I ask you something?  You only
          had one crew on the date rape piece,
          right?

     He extends his hand.

                    TOM
          Yes.  You're not going to stick
          around for the farewell party?

                    AARON
          No.  I don't know how much fun it
          will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
          have to drop off their credentials
          with the security guard.

     Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
     few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

                    AARON
          This story they won't cover.  And if
          the network doesn't cover it -- it
          must not be important so why worry.

                    TOM
               (eyeing him)
          I'm going to miss you -- you're a
          prick in a great way...

     Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

                    TOM
          You know what I...

                    AARON
          No, I liked the way it made me sound.
          Okay.  Be good.  So long.

     He exits.

     INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

     AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
     A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
     mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
     he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
     desk.

     INSERT - PAPER

     "Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

     INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

     AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
     moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
     of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

     TOM'S P.O.V.

     Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

     ON JANE

     AS she embraces an older secretary.

                    OLDER SECRETARY
          You know what I always wanted to
          tell you -- that...

                    JANE
          Shhh.  This isn't the last time
          we'll see each other.  It's not.

     A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

                    JANE
          We'll get them back -- it's going
          to change.

     Blair is at hand as they embrace.

                    BLAIR
          Except for socially, you're my role
          model.

     And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
     She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
     little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
     rendezvous.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

     AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
     the door.

                    JANE
          These people -- it's all so awful.
          It just hurts physically, doesn't
          it?  Like something's wrong with
          your bones, like your organs are
          shifting inside your body.

     She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

                    TOM
          Maybe I haven't been here long
          enough.
               (great)
          But, hey, congratulations on the
          promotion.

                    JANE
          How can you say that to me?

                    TOM
          Sorry.
               (a beat)
          I can't stand here feeing bad that
          I don't feel worse.  This has happened
          at every station I ever worked for.
          Look, I think it's crazy for you to
          come in here tomorrow and start a
          new job.  I have a week to get to
          my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
          island fast and find out how we are
          together away from this.

     A beat -- Jane takes it in.

                    JANE
          Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
          proposal.

                    TOM
          That's yes?

                    JANE
          That's more than 'yes' -- that's
          'you bet.'

     They kiss.

     INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The phone rings.  He answers.

                    AARON
          Hello.

     INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

                    JANE
          Bastard, sneak, quitter.

                    AARON
          Speaking.

                    JANE
          I just found out.  You didn't say
          anything to me?  You just resign?
          Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
          I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

     INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
     are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

                    JANE
          Why not try it for a few weeks?

                    AARON
          Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
          he couldn't help.  My agent has a
          hot prospect -- the number two station
          in Portland.  The general manager says
          he wants to be every bit as good as the
          networks.  Personally, I think he should
          aim higher.

                    JANE
          Tell me the God's honest truth --
          are you leaving because of me?
          Because if you are...

                    AARON
          Ernie told this story.  How he used
          to write obits and when the people
          in town called him up with death
          notices, he cried.  He was till
          that way when they promoted him
          out of obits.  He says you're lucky
          if you can get out while you could
          still cry.
               (a beat)
          I should have quit this place  three
          years ago.

                    JANE
          You're just trying to say all great
          stuff so I'll feel even worse that
          you're not around.

     He laughs.

                    AARON
          Let's go...

                    JANE
          I just want to sit here longer, I mean
          the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

                    AARON
          Maybe the best part of your life is over
          and you don't want to get up and start
          the bad part.

     Jane looks at him levelly.

                    JANE
          You are now required to sit here with
          me.
               (a beat; then)
          Come on...be smart for a second --
          what do you think will happen to us?

                    AARON
          Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
          years from now I'll be in town to
          collect an award representing the surge
          in foreign coverage by local stations.

                    JANE
               (smile, it's like 
                old times)
          Yes.

                    AARON
          I'll be walking with my wife and two
          children -- we'll bump into you on
          the street, my youngest son will say
          something and I'll tell him...
               (deliberately)
          ...it's not nice to make fun of single,
          fat ladies.

                    JANE
          You won't be able to stay mad at me,
          right?

                    AARON
          I hope so...
               (on her look he relents)
          No.  I'm not really mad.
               (nodding head as if
                reciting a catechism)
          I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
          be friends...we'll get hot for each other
          every few years at dinner and never act
          on it, okay?

     Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
     walks away, then turns.

                    AARON
          Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
          the piece the other night?  Ask
          yourself how we were able to see
          them when he only had one camera
          and that was pointing at the girl
          during the interview.
               (on her reaction)
          I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
          you.

     EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

     We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
     searching the stacks.

     INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

     As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
     EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

     INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

     As she inserts the tape into the player.

     ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

     As she watches... this is what she sees...

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          ...but the whole thing messed me
          up more than it should.

     She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

                    TOM'S VOICE
          Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

     The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
     continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
     at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
     the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
     that the tape is still rolling.

                    TOM
          That's enough.  That's enough.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          I'm sorry.

                    TOM
          Are you okay?

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          Yes, I'm sorry.

                    TOM
          Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
          about?

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          The way you were looking at me, I just went.

     Tom moves through the SHOT.

                    TOM
          I just need you for another minute now,
          so we can shoot from behind towards me,
          and, um...

                    YOUNG WOMAN
          Uh-huh.

                    TOM
          ...that way we have someplace to go when 
          we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
          head and look nerdy.

     Young Woman chuckles.

     Jane chuckles.

                    SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
          Tom

                    TOM
          Yeah.

                    SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
          It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
          It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

                    TOM
          Really?

                    YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
          Yes, it is.

                    SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
          For a second there, I thought you were 
          gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
          been something.

                    TOM
               (considering, then)
          Then give me a minute...

                    JANE
               (fully realizing)
          You fucking...

     As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
     Evening News piece -- as he does so:

                    YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
          Oh, that's amazing.

     ON Jane's shocked reaction:

     EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

     Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
     carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
     to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

                    TOM
          Look who's the organized one.
          I've got everything.

     He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
     her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

                    JANE
          I'm not going.

     He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

                    TOM
          Why?

                    JANE
          I saw the taped outtakes of the
          interview with the girl.  I know
          you 'acted' your reaction after
          the interview.

     Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
     behind, stalking him.

                    TOM
          I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
          verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
          it for real the first time -- but I get
          you.  That's not the reason you're not
          coming?

                    JANE
               (raising her voice)
          Of course it's the reason.  It's
          terrible what you did.

                    TOM
          We disagree on how God-awful it
          was.  Why don't you come with me
          and we can disagree and get a tan
          at the same time?

                    JANE
               (livid)
          Jesus, if you're glib about this
          I'm going to lose it.  I was up
          all night and...

                    TOM
               (calmly)
          Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

                    JANE
          It made me ill.  You could get
          fired for things like that.

                    TOM
          I got promoted for things like that.

                    JANE
          Working up tears for a new piece
          cutaway...You totally crossed the
          line between...

                    TOM
          It's hard not to cross it; they keep
          moving the little sucker, don't they?

                    JANE
               (distaste)
          It just proves that the difference we 
          have are...

                    TOM
          This is a one-way argument.  We've got
          six days; if you go and we fight and
          we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
          don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
          deal.  I go to London right after that.
          So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
          here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
          good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

                    JANE
               (taking ticket)
          It's amazing.  You commit this
          incredible breach of ethics and
          you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
          and get this.  When you edited that...

                    TOM
               (deliberately)
          I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

     He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
     stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
     of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

     INT. TERMINAL - DAY

     On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
     -- pissed off at her.

     INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

     Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

     INT. METAL DETECTOR

     As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
     there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
     stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
     from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
     without a buzzer and moves on.

     INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

     Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
     passengers to the plane.

     As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

                    TICKET AGENT
               (to Tom)
          This is the last one.

     Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
     He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

                    JANE
          That's not going to be the way
          we say good-bye.  Even though I
          think what you did was rotten --
          it's not all impersonal.  You mean
          something to me.

                    TOM
               (interrupting)
          You keep coming after me and
          looking down on me.  It's starting
          to make me batty.

     She looks at him.

                    TOM (cont'd)
          I can't help it that they like me.
          And I like that they like me.  And
          I think there's a lot of this job that
          I do well.  What do you think it takes
          to do this job -- the way they have
          it now?

                    JANE
          I don't wan to discuss work.

                    TOM
          Well, let's do a special report on
          that...I mean that's news.

                    JANE
          I knew what you meant.

                    TOM
          What I don't know, I can learn and
          what I know, nobody can teach.
          Excuse me for saying it about myself,
          but I think it's true.
               (old habit)
          What do you think?
               (catching himself)
          Never mind what you think.

     They look at each other.

                    JANE
          You're lucky I came after you so
          you got that off your...

                    TOM
          Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

                    JANE
          It's okay.

                    TICKET AGENT
          Sir?

     The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

                    JANE
          So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

                    TOM
               (wary but hopeful)
          You want to come?

                    JANE
               (totally open)
          It's just that one of the few things
          I'm not confused about is what I
          was saying downstairs, that...

                    TOM
               (giving up -- sadly,
                finally)
          Then you should stay here.

                    JANE
               (softly)
          It's better when you let me say it.

     He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
     for each other.  While in the embrace:

                    TOM
          Take it easy.

                    JANE
          Why did I have to do this to
          myself?  Watch you take off.
               (then)
          Call me if you need anything.

     He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

                    TOM
          Oh, honey.

     He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
     paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

     ON JANE

     Watching him go.

     JANE'S P.O.V.

     Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
     much as he is when on television.

     INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

     Jane gets quickly into cab.

                    CABBIE
          Good morning.

                    JANE
          Good morning.
               (after collecting herself)
          Dupont Circle, please.

     The cab pulls away.

                    JANE
          Don't take the beltway, because at this
          time of day there's gonna be a lot...
               (stops herself, then)
          ...Go any way you want.

     She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
     quietly adding what she knows to be true:

                    JANE
          But New York Avenue's faster.

                                   FADE OUT:

     FADE IN:

     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
     words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

     A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
     Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
     will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
     for the '90s."

     INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
     may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
     from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
     Tom is in mid-speech.

                    TOM
          ... when they told me Bill had decided
          to retire and offered me the Evening
          News, I thought it was the same kind
          of joke we used to pull back at the
          station -- turning off somebody's
          prompter in the middle of a show.

     Some good-natured laughter.

                    TOM (cont'd)
          And then when they heard my reaction --
          they thought I was kidding.  I told them
          I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
          to be the Managing Editor -- that there
          were people better qualified than I to 
          control the content and if there 
          weren't we were all in trouble.

     The audience really enjoys this:

     SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

     MOVING SHOT...

     The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
     a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
     the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
     not unlike yourself.

                    TOM
          And now to something more
          important... I'd like to introduce
          my bride.
               (gestures to a woman in
                the front row)
          Lila?

     A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

     ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

     Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

     INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

     Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

     ON TOM

     As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

                    TOM
          Holy shit, Aaron.

     He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
     uncomfortable with the attention.

                    TOM
          Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

                    LILA
               (high British accent)
          Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
          50 or so role models.

                    AARON
          Hi.

                    TOM
          Well, this kid couldn't possibly
          belong to anyone else.  What's
          your name?

                    BOY
          Clifford...

                    AARON
               (indicating Tom)
          Do you know who this is, Cliff?

                    BOY
          The big joke?

     Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

                    AARON
          I'm just bringing him over to give
          Jane a look at him --

                    TOM
          I thought she'd be here.  I'll
          go with you.

                    AARON
          Okay.

                    TOM
               (to Lila)
          I'll see you back at the hotel.

                    LILA
               (cool)
          All right.

     He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

                    LILA
          Tom, the speech was magnificent.

                    AARON
          Oh, I didn't say anything about
          your speech.

                    TOM
          I appreciate it.

     INT. WALKWAY - DAY

     Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
     as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
     blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
     has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

     She HEARS her name being called.

     ON JANE

     Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
     they reach her.

                    JANE
               (to herself)
          Well, why not?
               (as they arrive)
          Hey, what is this?  My life's
          rushing in front of my eyes.

                    TOM
          A picnic?

                    JANE
          I thought for ol' Cliff here --
          Look at you?  You're more adorable
          than your pictures.  Look what I
          got for you.

     She hands him a toy.

                    AARON
          What do you say, Cliff?

     The boy kisses Jane's hand.

                    AARON
          He excels at gratitude.

                    TOM
               (to Jane)
          Are you any closer to a decision?

                    JANE
          I think so...They've been talking
          to me about being Tom's Managing
          Editor.

                    AARON
          Really?

                    JANE
               (to Tom)
          I'm going to take it.

                    TOM
          What a great surprise.  I didn't
          think we had a chance.  I heard
          you wanted to stay in Washington.

                    JANE
          Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
          fly up a lot.

                    TOM
          Well, we should talk.  You going to
          have time for  dinner?  I'd like
          you to meet Lila.

                    JANE
          I'm sorry because I was looking
          forward to that, but I' m going
          back in a few hours.

                    TOM
          Okay...It's so good to see you.

     She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

                    TOM
               (to Aaron)
          It's nice to see you.

                    AARON
          Congratulations on history's longest
          winning streak.

                    TOM
          If you ever get restless in Portland,
          let me know.

                    AARON
          Why?

     Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

     ON JANE

     Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
     powerful.

                    TOM
               (to Jane as he leaves)
          Bye...boss.

     Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
     to see his son running after Tom.

                    AARON
               (calling)
          Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

     Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

                    TOM
               (to Clifford)
          Go back to your daddy.

     The boy starts back.

                    AARON
          Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

     As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

                    AARON
               (to Jane)
          So who's the guy?

                    JANE
          Well, we met about three months ago.
          He works at the surgeon general office.
          He loves boating.  So, he's been 
          getting me into water skiing.

     Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
     Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

                    JANE
          I like it!  So, doll, what about you
          lately?

                    AARON
          Well -- my wife got this new job...

     He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
     their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
     the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

                                   FADE OUT.
