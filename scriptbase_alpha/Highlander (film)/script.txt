          February 6, 1985






           FADE IN:

           MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

           New York Rangers v. Edmonton Oilers.

           15,000 screaming fans leap to their feet.

           Gretsky steals the puck, streaks across the ice, beats two
           defenders, shoots and scores.

           Oilers 6, Rangers 0. Oiler fans bellow approval

           One silent SPECTATOR, in overcoat, slacks and scarf, stands
           out in the crowd, unmoved by the din. He is:

           CONNER MACLEOD

           An aura of power and charisma sets him apart. His hypnotic
           eyes watch Ranger defenders slam Gretsky into the wall,
           punching and kicking him.

           SHOUTING PLAYERS storm onto the ice

           STICKS SWING IN A BRUTAL FREE-FOR-ALL.

           The crowd CHEERS. A DRUNK WHOOPS at the silent man.

                                     DRUNK
                       Helluva fight, ain'it? Helluva fight.
                       Lotta fun, ain'it?

           Oblivious, Macleod watches the battle. In his mind,
           the STICK-WIELDING PLAYERS BECOME:

           in the riot on the ice.

           Concentrating, MacLeod scans the crowd. Like a predator
           catching a scent, he leaves swiftly. The Drunk yells after
           him.

                                     DRUNK
                       Hey!  Where ya goin'?

           MACLEOD

           striding past rows of cars. FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in the Garden's

           underground garage. MacLeod senses a presence. It's very
           close.

           Suddenly, a MAN's silhouette appears in a tunnel, blocking
           his path, breath steaming in the artic air.

                                     MAN
                       MacLeod.

           A huge sword appears in the Man's hands. He swings. MacLeod
           sidesteps, drawing a weapon from inside his coat.

           A Samurai sword, carved handguard, razor-sharp, 
feather-light.

           The Man's overhead slams onto concrete, ripping up hunks of
           stone. MacLeod fans his blade.

           MACLEOD AND THE MAN"S SWORDS

           clang in the tunnel, pulverizing cars, gouging columns in
           showers of brilliant sparks.

           Running Feet, Shouting VOICES, distant SIRENS.

           His opponent is outmatched. Surging forward:

           MACLEOD

           cuts off the Man's head. A shimmering energy surges between
           the corpse and MacLeod. MacLeod starts to glow. The garage
           is crackling. Windshields EXPLODE. SIRENS closer.

                                     VOICE O.S.

                       Over here -- !

           Samurai sword in hand, MacLeod sprints off, swallowed by the
           dark. People SHOUT.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           racing through the garage. Behind him, a woman screams.
           Desperate, he hides his weapon in a roof duct hidden by
           tiles, driving it out of sight.

           In the arena above, New York scores. The CROWD CHEERS.
           The SOUND DISTORTS, becoming --

           Loch Shiel, Scottish Highlands, 1536. Glamis castle
           towers over thatched huts by the shore.

           A DRAWBRIDGE CRASHES down like thunder, skirling BAG-
           PIPES and DRUMS.

           THE CLAN MACLEOD

           Two hundred strong, rides out to battle, tartan cloaks,
           bronze shields, claymores flashing in the sun.
           Hatchet-faced FATHER RAINEY chants prayers.

                                    FATHER RAINEY
                       God bless our brave heroes. May
                       this year of Our Lord 1536 bring
                       victory to the Clan Macleod.

                       Fraziers! Long live the Clan
                       MacLeod!

           Riding in the column:

           CONNER MACLEOD

           The ice hockey spectator, 466 years earlier. The same age
           but rough-hewn, not yet possessing the quiet strength of
           later years. Eyes alight, huge claymore sword strapped to
           his side.

           Carved into the blade, the single word:

                                MACLEOD

           Riding with him, two older clansmen: DUGAL, his
           cousin, short, arms like trees, and ANGUS, bulky and
           bearded. Dugal shouts over the din.

                                     DUGAL
                       Are you scared, Conner?

                                     MACLEOD
                              (lying)
                       No, cousin Dugal. I'm not.

                                     ANGUS
                              (to MacLeod)
                       Don't talk rubbish, lad. I peed
                       my kilt the first time I rode to
                       battle.

                                     DUGAL
                              (to MacLeod)
                       Ah, Angus pees his kilt all the
                       time.

           MacLeod laughs, hiding his nervousness.

           A pretty girl, KATE, races down the column holding high
           a bouquet.

           MacLeod sweeps her up. She plants the flowers in his
           hat. She jumps down excitedly.

                                     DUGAL
                              (continuing;
                               to MacLeod)
                       A girl like that can wound a
                       soldier more than a Frazier's
                       sword, my friend.

                                     KATE
                       Angus, you and Dugal bring him
                       back in one piece. D'you hear?

                                     DUGAL
                       We know which piece you want,
                       lassie.

           Yell from Angus. DRUMS and BAGPIPES.

                                                       CUT TO:
   
           THE KURGAN

           standing on a hill, watching the Clan MacLeod advance
           into the gathering moorish fog below.

           The Kurgan is a frightening hulk astride a massive
           black stallion. Flashing eyes and a cruel mouth.

           Frazier chief MURDOCH gallops up.

                                     KURGAN
                       Is the one called Conner among
                       them?

                                     MURDOCH
                       Aye.

                                     KURGAN
                       Remember our pact. The boy is
                       mine.

           Murdoch nods. He fears this giant.

           FROM BELOW

           can be heard the BATTLE CRIES and frenzied BAGPIPES of
           the MacLeod and Frazier clans.

                                     MURDOCH.
                       It's begun. Death to the MacLeods!

           They charge.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE BATTLE OF LOCH SHIEL, 1536

           MacLeods and Frazers collide in fury. Raging carnage.
           Fog slowly moving in.

           MacLeod, Dugal and Angus in the thick of it. MacLeod
           tries to engage the enemy. Each time they avoid him.

           Dugal's helpless beneath three Frazers. Flying from
           the saddle, Angus kills two of them. The third bolts.

           Gradually, the fog makes it impossible to see more than
           a few yards. Each man's battle is his own, hopelessly
           separated from the battling clansmen around them.

           Wild-eyed, MacLeod leaps off his horse, hauling Dugal up.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (shouting)
                       Nobody will fight me! They all
                       run away!

                                     DUGAL
                              (grinning)
                       Great, laddie. Stay by me.

           Suddenly, they see:

           A HULKING GIANT ON A BLACK STALLION

           thundering down on them, sword wheeling, an unstoppable
           juggernaut, butchering everything in his path.

           It's the Kurgan

                                     MACLEOD
                              (transfixed)
                       Mother of God -- !

           He feels dizzy. The Kurgan knocks Dugal senseless,
           disintegrating MacLeod's shield.

           Snarling, he vaults from his horse, driving his blade
           deep into MacLeod's stomach.

           Mortally wounded, MacLeod drops to his knees, vainly
           swinging at the ghastly specter. The Kurgan swats away
           his sword as though it were a toothpick.

           Relishing the moment, he raises his blade high, voice
           grating in triumph

                                     KURGAN
                       There can be only one.

           MacLeod is helpless. Time hangs suspended. Lost in
           the blackness of the Kurgan's eyes, he prepares to meet
           his maker.

           At the last second, Dugal, Angus and others appear,
           pile-driving the Kurgan back over dying clansmen.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       Another time, Highlander.

           Life ebbing, MacLeod groans, staring at the sky.

                                                       CUT TO:

           POLICE CRUISERS

           SCREECHING to a halt outside the Garden, SIRENS DYING, 
blocking
           the exit tunnel. Cops pile out, guns drawn, GARFIELD and
           HAGGERTY in charge.

           Headlights appear. A BMW crests the ramp at 60, sees the 
block,
           SQUEALS to a smoking stop. Cops take aim.

                                     HAGGERTY

                       Move -- !

           MacLeod obeys. They frisk him. Garfield finds a wallet, 
checks
           a license:

           MacLeod's photo, name and address:

                            NEW YORK, NY 10013

           Garfield shines a light in the suspect's eyes. They seem 
bottom-
           less, unafraid.

                                     GARFIELD
                       Where you going in such a hurry,
                       Mr. Nash?

           Garfield grabs his arm. trying to handcuff him. Bad idea.
           MacLeod hurls him away. Garfield falls on his ass.

           A ton of cops swamp MacLeod, slamming his face into the wind-

           shield. Enraged, Garfield staggers up, jamming his .45 into
           MacLeod's neck.

                                     GARFIELD
                       Don't move, asshole. Don't even

           breathing his last on a trestle bed in a hut, torso bandaged.

           Fire crackles in a hearth. Kate kneels by the bed. Battle-

           Forensics, sexy in jeans, boots and windbreaker, shoves

                                     MORAN
                       Yeah. An antique dealer named
                       Nash on Hudson Street.

           She moves away:

           ANOTHER ANGLE

           Frowning, she examines a row of cars, confounded by the
           blitzed windshields. What the hell happened?

           BESIDE THE BODY

           Lebowsky takes final shots, winking at Bedsoe.

                                     LEBOWSKY
                              (to Moran)
                       How come you're not asking me the
                       cause of death, Frank?

           Bedsoe chuckles.

                                     MORAN
                       Cut the crap, Lebowsky. What time
                       did he buy it?

           Lebowsky kneels, examining the corpse, checking his watch.

                                     LEBOWSKY
                       Ten. Ten-thirty. And whatever
                       made this cut was razor-sharp.

                                     BEDSOE
                              (to Moran, indicating
                              corpse)
                       Frank, wasn't there something on
                       the teletype about a guy killed
                       in Jersey 2 nights ago, just like
                       this?

           Moran scratches his head.

           BEHIND THE CORVETTE

           Brenda freezes, staring down at a huge sword.

                                        BRENDA
                              (shouting)
                       Hey, Frank. Look at this.

           Moran and Lebowsky join her.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       It's a Toledo-Salamanca.

                                     MORAN
                       It's a what -- ?

           She dusts the jeweled hilt for prints.

                                     BRENDA
                       A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

                                     MORAN
                       Worth much?

                                     BRENDA
                       Only about a million bucks.
                              (standing up)
                       Any antique dealer with a shop on
                       Hudson Street could tell you that.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           sitting in a room, waiting. Peeling paint, tape
           recorder, table and chairs.

           Garfield, the cop who booked him, leans on the wall,
           itching to get even.

           MacLeod suddenly stares at him. Garfield shivers. The
           guy's eyes are like lasers. The cop looks away.

           MORAN AND BEDSOE

           enter, slamming the door. Moran's got a package and
           folder. Bedsoe joins Garfield against the wall.

           Moran sits down, package by his chair. He clicks on
           the tape and opens a folder.

           Inside: wallet, money and driver's license issued to
           Russell Nash.

           He tosses a mug-shot of a swarthy man onto the table.

                                     MORAN
                       Ever see this guy before, Nash?

           MacLeod hasn't.

                                     MORAN
                               
                       Name's Osta Vazilek. Bulgarian
                       national. Got his head chopped
                       off two nights ago in Jersey.
                              (unwrapping
                               package)
                       Ever get over to Jersey, Nash?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Not if I can help it.

                                     MORAN
                       You're an antique dealer, right?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Yes.

           Moran lays down the jewelled weapon.

                                     MORAN
                       Okay, what's this?

                                     MACLEOD
                       A sword

                                     MORAN
                       It's a --
                              (checks notes)
                       Toledo-Salamanca broad-sword.
                       Worth a million bucks.

                                     MACLEOD
                       So?

                                     MORAN
                       You wanna hear a theory?
                              (MacLeod shrugs)
                       You went down to the garage to buy
                       this sword from some guy.
                              (quickly)
                       What was his name?

                                     MACLEOD
                       I don't know. You tell me.

                                     MORAN
                       His name was Iman Fasil. You fought
                       about the price. Then you cut off
                       his head.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Wanna hear another theory?
                              (Moran nods)
                       This Fasil was so upset by the
                       Rangers' lousy performance tonight,
                       he went down to the garage and in a
                       fit of depression, cut off his own
                       head.

           Bedsoe LAUGHS.

                                     MORAN
                       That ain't funny, Walt

           Garfield can control himself no longer.

                                     GARFIELD
                       You a faggot, Nash?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Why? You cruising for ass?

                                     GARFIELD
                              (leaning in)
                       I'll tell you what happened,
                       Russell -- you went down to the
                       garage looking for a hand-job,
                       and just didn't want to pay for
                       it.

                                     MACLEOD
                       You're sick.

           Garfield swings. Kicking the table aside, MacLeod jumps
           up, SMASHING his fist into Garfield's sternum. Garfield
           goes down.

           Moran's on Garfield in a flash, knee on his chest,
           Bedsoe struggles to restrain MacLeod.

                                     MORAN
                              (shouting)
                       Calm down -- !
                              (to Garfield)
                       I mean it, damnit -- !

           Flinging Bedsoe off him, MacLeod picks up his wallet.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Am I under arrest?
                              (no answer)
                       Then we're through.

           He walks to the door.

                                     MORAN
                       Nash, we're just getting started.

           MacLeod is gone. Moran stands up. Garfield struggles
           to his feet.

                                     GARFIELD
                       Jesus. That guy hits like a
                       train.

                                     MORAN
                       Shut up, Rocky. I'll deal with
                       you in a minute.

           He turns to Bedsoe

                                     MORAN
                               
                       Tail him, Walt. And try and pay
                       attention. That sucker's cool as ice.

           Bedsoe leaves. Moran turns to Garfield

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           MacLeod steps out into the crisp night air.

           Oblivious to traffic, his eyes scan the dark. Sensing
           something, he turns south, looking toward Jersey.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A TAN CUTLASS ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE

           Knifing through the night. Inside, behind the wheel:

           THE KURGAN - A CHILLING SPECTER

           Shark's eyes, short curly hair.

           Like MacLeod, he hasn't aged -- but a hideous scar runs
           from ear-to ear across his throat. It affects his voice,
           turning it into a metallic gurgle. News on the RADIO.

                                     NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
                       Police arrested a man at the
                       decapitation scene in Madison
                       Square Garden. They have not
                       released his name.

                                     KURGAN
                              (turns it off)
                       I know his name.

           His metallic gargle is even more grating.

           He slams a cassette into the stereo, a high-decibel
           heavy-metal ROCK SONG: It's the Kurgan's anthem.

           Raving singer, pounding drums, shrieking guitars. In
           the headlights, a sign:

                       YOU ARE NOW LEAVING NEW JERSEY
                              THE GARDEN STATE
                        HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR STAY!

           The Kurgan smiles grotesquely.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       I had a better time than Osta
                       Vazilek. That is for sure.

           His voice sounds like nails on a slate.

           BRENDA

           sitting at a spectrograph, placing metal shards under
           a lens. Clamping wires to them, she starts a machine.

           HUMMING sound. Crackling arc. She checks a computer,
           takes photos. The arc dies.

           She waits. A printer starts. Data rolls. She studies
           it.

                                     BRENDA
                       It's not possible.

                       Son-of-a-bitch.

           Grabbing coat and bag, she heads for the door.

           Hungry and tired, Bedsoe trudges past bums, porno-pits
           and neon signs.

           MacLeod descends stairs to a subway. Picking up speed:

           BEDSOE

           races down after him. Reaching the tracks, he can't
           believe his eyes.

           The platform's deserted.

           MACLEOD'S FACE IN THE FLARE OF THE LIGHTER

           In the underground garage. Reaching into the roof-duct
           hidden by tiles, he pulls out his Samurai sword.

           Noting the chipped edge and missing pieces, he slides
           it into a sheath inside his coat.

           FOOTSTEPS. He snuffs the lighter

           Silence. Something's down here. She can feel it.

           starts running, faster and faster.

                                     BRENDA
                       Vodka. Lots of it.

           He leaves.

           Removing the plastic bag from her purse, she opens it,
           tipping a metal shard into her trembling hand.

           MACLEOD

           enters and looks around. Spotting her, he sits in a
           nearby booth. Phil re-appears with a bottle of vodka.

                                     PHIL
                       Say when.

           three-quarters full.

                                     BRENDA
                       When.

           She drinks. Noticing MacLeod, Phil glides over, return-
           ing to Brenda

                                     PHIL
                       The guy over there wants you to
                       join him for a drink.

                                     BRENDA
                       What guy?

           Leaning forward, she sees a dim profile.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       Thank him and tell him no.

           Phil delivers the message. Brenda gulps vodka, mind in
           turmoil.

           Suddenly, MacLeod sits by her side. She jumps like a cat.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       What do you think you're doing?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Joining you. I'd like to buy you
                       a drink.

           Brenda drains her vodka, setting down the glass.

                                     BRENDA
                       I don't drink

           About to tell him to get lost, she looks into his eyes for
           the first time. Unexpectedly, she's overcome by feelings
           of warmth and safety.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What's your name?

           His voice caresses her. She's mesmerized by his gaze.
           Adrift, she hears herself answer.

                                     BRENDA
                       Brenda.

           The silence between them is electric. Phil RINGS the
           register. The spell is broken.

           She's got to get away from this guy. Shouldering her bag,
           she rises, heading for the door. He doesn't move.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Do you get over to Madison Square
                       Garden much?

           She freezes, heart pounding.

                                     BRENDA
                              (turning)
                       What did you say?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Madison Square Garden. Get over
                       there much?

           Eyes that were comforting 10 seconds ago are now cold,
           drilling into her brain.

                                     BRENDA
                       Why?

                                     MACLEOD
                       They've got basketball.
                       The circus. Ice-hockey.
                              (a beat)
                       What's your last name, Brenda?

           She swallows hard.

                                     BRENDA
                       How come you're asking me
                       about Madison Square Garden?
                       Did you follow me in here?

           No answer. He smiles. Her blood turns to ice.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       Who the hell are you?

                                     MACLEOD
                              (rising)
                       Let me walk you home, Brenda.
                       Pretty girl, alone on the
                       streets at night. No telling
                       what could happen.

                                     BRENDA
                       Forget it. I can take care
                       of myself.

           He shrugs, sitting down. She walks out, pausing to look back 
at him
           in the gloom. He raises his glass to her.

                                                       CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE THE BAR

           Brenda waits in shadows, watching MacLeod leave. He stands
           for a moment, looking up and down 55th Street.

           Pulling up his collar, he moves off into the night, turning
           down a dark alley.

           Making a fateful decision, she follows him.

     

                                                  CUT TO:
           MACLEOD

           walking briskly near the East River. Cold wind blowing. 4:00 
A.M.
           Deserted.

           Steam rises from vents. Cars line the curb. Cats YOWL. It's 
spooky.

           Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he stops every few yards.

           At the corner of 46th, his eyes rake the street. Nothing. 
Without
           warning, he sprints off, disappearing into:

           A SHADOWY CONSTRUCTION SITE

           RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. He grasps the Samurai hilt inside his 
coat.

           A FIGURE hurtles round the corner. Springing forward, MacLeod

           grabs handfuls of hair.

           SHOUTING in panic, Brenda fights to get free.

                                     BRENDA
                       Get your hands off me!

           Pumping with adrenalin, MacLeod shakes her, pulling her into 
the
           dark, against a brick wall. She SCREAMS.

           A light goes on in a nearby apartment.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Be quiet. I --

           He breaks off, listening to the night, eyes flashing. 
Instinctively
           MacLeod ducks, yanking her with him to the dirt.

           Next second:

           A GLEAMING SWORD SHATTERS BRICK

           inches above their heads. He rolls away from her, struggling 
to
           avoid a slashing blade. Dumbstruck, Brenda stares up at:

           A HOWLING GIANT WITH A SCAR ACROSS HIS NECK

           wielding a huge sword. It's the Kurgan.

           MacLeod grabs a steel pipe, blocking the Kurgan's murderous
           blows. The Kurgan's so fast, MacLeod can't draw his sword.

           In desperation, he side-steps and charges, tackling him.
           Locked together, they topple down an embankment into:


           A SHALLOW PIT

           Untangling himself, sword in hand, the Kurgan attacks. 
MacLeod
           defends himself with the pipe.

                                     KURGAN
                              (swinging)
                       Good to see you again, MacLeod.
                       400 years is a long time.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (blocking)
                       You slimy bastard --!

           SOUNDS of DISTANT SIRENS.

           UP THE EMBANKMENT

           Brenda peers through the murk. Straining to see what's going 
on,
           she loses her footing. CRYING OUT, she falls:

           INTO THE PIT

           Cannoning into MacLeod's back.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Jesus Christ!
                              (yelling)
                       Get the hell out of here!

           Bellowing, the giant charges again. MacLeod shoves Brenda out 
of
           the path of sudden death.

                                     KURGAN
                              (rasping)
                       There can only be one, Highlander.

           The 2 men battle through the skeleton of a building. The 
Kurgan's
           murderous blade misses MacLeod by inches, slicing through 
solid
           iron.

           The sky ERUPTS. THRASHING ROTORS. ROARING down-blast.
           Blinding clouds of dirt and debris.

           IT'S A POLICE CHOPPER

           Searchlight beams probe swirling dust. From the sky, an
           AMPLIFIED VOICE:

                                     VOICE V.O.
                       You, on the ground! Stay where you
                       are!

           Brenda CHOKES, blinded. From nowhere, MacLeod grabs her.
           His arms are like steel.

                                     KURGAN'S VOICE
                              (SHOUTING out of
                              the dark)
                       Some other time, Highlander.
                       There can be only one.

           MacLeod hauls Brenda up the embankment, away from the
           light, melting into the dark. SIRENS CLOSER.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           dragging Brenda across 1st Avenue.

                                     BRENDA
                              (lungs bursting)
                       Stop. For Christ's sake.

           They halt under a street-light. She gasps for breath.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       Who in the name of God was that?
                       He called you Highlander. What
                       did he mean, "There can be only
                       one?" Only one what?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Shut up!

           He pulls her close, eyes like bullet-holes.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Listen, lady. You almost got
                       yourself killed.

                                     BRENDA
                       I want --

           He shakes her, trying to scare her away.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Don't you ever follow me again
                              (intensely)
                       Forget about what you saw tonight.
                       You only have one life. If you
                       value it --
                              (angrily)
                       Go home!

           He strides off. A garbage can CRASHES in an alley.
           Brenda jumps.

                                                       CUT TO:

           KENNY, A DESK CLERK

           signing in the Kurgan. Ansonia Hotel, 73rd and Broadway.
           A T.V. is on Derelicts litter the lobby.

           KENNY, a chain-smoking greaser, checks the name the
           Kurgan's written in the register, handing him a key.

                                     KENNY
                       Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315.
                       And I'm gonna hit you for 20 in
                       advance.

           The Kurgan pulls out a thick roll of bills, dropping a
           20. Kenny eyes the roll greedily.

                                     KENNY
                               
                       Listen, you want anything. Broads,
                       blow. Just dial 0.

           Picking up a black, oblong case, the Kurgan heads for the
           elevator.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE KURGAN

           on a sagging bed in Room 315. Roaches crawl on a hot-
           plate.

           Shirtless, heavily-scarred, he munches tacos, watching
           Yosemite Sam on T.V., digging the violence.

           He opens his black case. Laid out in velvet slots:

           THE COMPONENTS OF A LARGE SWORD

           Meaty fingers caress quillions, pommel, hilt and blade.
           Getting up, he moves to the window. Below, junkies
           shiver in Needle Park.

                                     KURGAN
                       At last... the Gathering.

           He chuckles, an unnerving sound. KNOCK on the door.

           A blonde HOOKER in hot-pants and boots, breasts burst-
           ing from a tight sweater, leans on the jamb, cracking
           gum.

                                     HOOKER
                       I'm Candy.

                                     KURGAN
                       Of course you are.

           Dragging her in, he flings her on the bed. Fearfully,
           she watches him unbuckle his belt. He slams the door.

                                                       CUT TO:

           DUGAL

           slamming down a tankard of ale in the Glamis tavern.
           Angus and Kate sit with him.

           It's 1536, the day after the fight between the Frazers
           and MacLeods.

           Angry villagers pack the place, only one thing on their
           minds -- MacLeod's strange delivery from the jaws of
           death.

           Kate's thrilled by all the excitement.

                                     DUGAL
                       You saw the wound, Angus. He should
                       have died.

                                     KATE
                       I say he's got the devil in him.

           The tavern erupts in shouting

           MacLeod enters. Sudden silence. Seeing Angus, he moves
           to join his table.

                                     DUGAL
                              (rising)
                       Drinking with us, are you?

           MacLeod freezes. Kate's eyes sparkle. Angus avoids
           his gaze.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What's the matter, Dugal?

                                     DUGAL
                       You. Talking and breathing -- and
                       this morning, all but a corpse.
                              (shouting)
                       How did you manage that, Conner
                       MacLeod?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Would you rather I was dead?

                                     KATE
                              (to crowd)
                       It's not natural. He's in league
                       with Lucifer.

           Uproar.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Don't say that, Kate.

                                     DUGAL
                       I'll say it. You've got the devil
                       in you.

                                     MACLEOD
                       We've been kinsmen 15 years, cousin.

                                     DUGAL
                       Conner MacLeod was my kinsman. I
                       don't know who you are.

           Kate's eyes dance. The tension is electric

                                     ANGUS
                       You'd best leave, Conner.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (bravely)
                       I'm not going anywhere.

            Dugal swings at MacLeod's head, knocking him down,
           kicking him in the ribs.

           A plowman destroys a chair on MacLeod's back. Angus
           shouts over the din --

                                     ANGUS
                       For God's sake, stop -- !

           A villager belts MacLeod with a jug. Struggling, he
           disappears under a shouting heap of clansmen.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD WITH AN OX-YOKE STRAPPED TO HIS BACK

           Arms bound to it with ropes, face battered, on his
           knees in the dirt.

           Beyond, Glamis Castle towers over Loch Shiel.

           Dugal, Angus, Father Rainey and Kate stand in a circle
           of yelling villagers. The excitement has unhinged
           Kate's mind.

                                     ANGUS
                              (yelling at Dugal)
                       He's your cousin, man.

                                     FATHER RAINEY
                       Burn him. It's the only way.

                                     VILLAGERS
                              (chanting)
                       Burn him! Burn him!

                                     ANGUS
                              (over crowd)
                       Quiet!

           The NOISE subsides.

                                     ANGUS
                               
                       There'll be no burning here today.
                       We'll banish him.

                                     KATE
                       Burn him! Burn him!

           Dugal's disgusted by Kate's religious frenzy.

                                     DUGAL
                       Be quiet, Kate.

           The villagers shout objections. He nods to Angus and
           they help MacLeod to his feet. He staggers under the
           yoke.

                                     ANGUS
                       Can you walk?

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'll bloody well walk out of here.

                                     ANGUS
                       Move, friend. Before they change
                       their minds.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'll not forget you, Angus.

           MacLeod is driven out. Villagers spit and curse.
           Wild-eyed, Kate dances round him.

                                     KATE
                       Devil! Devil! Devil!

                                     VILLAGERS
                              (chanting)
                       Devil! Devil! Devil!

           ANOTHER ANGLE

           Stumbling along the loch, MacLeod heads for the moun-
           tains.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           walking west on Christopher. Dim streetlights. Dogs
           BARKING.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD'S HOME - 1182 HUDSON STREET, SOHO

           Surrounded by Irish bars, art galleries, rubble-filled
           lots.

           MacLeod heads for a run-down shop next to a dilapidated
           ten-story glass-and-iron warehouse.

           On the shop door:

                              R. NASH -- ANTIQUES

           Rummaging for keys, he unlocks the door and goes in-
           side.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD IN A RISING FREIGHT ELEVATOR

           The doors open. Before him:

           A HUGE, OPEN, NEW YORK LOFT

           The change from drab outside to sumptuous inside is
           stunning. Exotic fish swim in a huge aquarium.

           MacLeod descends the stairs to:

           A SUNKEN LIVING ROOM

           filled with modern art. High veilings, comfortable
           sofas, Adam fireplace, spectacular views of the river.

           Moving past speakers and TVs, he drops his keys on a
           table beside an intercom and answering machine.

           In a silver frame on the mantle: a photo of MacLeod
           with a young girl, 1952. MacLeod moves through:

           A GEORGIAN DINING AREA

           Queen Anne table, silver candlesticks, tapestries on
           the wall. He enters:

           AN ULTRA-MODERN KITCHEN

           Loosening his tie, he fixes a drink and walks out.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           entering his silver room. Elegant and oval. Fabric
           walls. Sofas, tables, displays of ancient artifacts:

           On one wall, like spokes of a wheel: 13 broad swords.

           Beside them, a bronze shield, claymore and cloak -- the
           black-and-yellow tartan of the Clan MacLeod.

           Sipping his drink, he sinks into a sofa, eyeing a glass
           case lit by pin-spots. Inside:


           An ancient sheepskin doll.

           A 16th century catalan feathered hat.

           A rusty anvil and tongs.

           MacLeod stares at the anvil and tons, remembering:

                                                       CUT TO:

           RED-HOT IRON IN TONGS

           crashing onto an anvil in a sweltering blacksmith's
           forge. It's 1541.
           Wielding a hammer, streaked with grime and sweat,
           MacLeod pounds out a horsehoe, plunging it into water.
           HISSING STEAM.

           In the five years since his banishment, he's filled out
           -- although he's lost none of his wide-eyed, youthful
           exuberance.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           shoeing a mare outside. The forge clings to a crag.
           Miles down a precarious trail, the town of Jedburgh.

           Up the hill, a 3-story stone house. From the house:

           HEATHER MACLEOD

           appears in sheepskins, bonnet and boots, carrying a
           basket.

           Full-breasted, lusty and apple-cheeked, she feeds
           geese, watching him.

                                     HEATHER
                              (waving basket)
                       Pie and ale. D'you want it?

           Dropping his hammer, he grabs her buttocks, crushing
           her to him, grinning.

                                     MACLEOD
                       All the time.

                                     HEATHER
                              (squealing)
                       You filthy sod. You're all muck
                       and muscle.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Aye. The way you like it.

           He grins, kissing her. Stripping his apron, he dunks
           his torso in a rain barrel, shaking himself off like a
           dog.

           She smiles. He's the loveliest man in the world.

                                                       CUT TO:
           MACLEOD AND HEATHER

           making love on the cliff-top in the grass. Remains of
           a picnic.

           Thunderheads soar over the mountains. A storm is com-
           ing. MacLeod kisses her. She responds

                                     HEATHER
                       You can do that forever if you
                       like, my lord. Will you, Conner?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Aye, blossom. I will.

           Foreign CURSES. Startled, they sit up.

                                                       CUT TO:

           JUAN RAMIREZ

           climbing the trail to the forge. Olive skin, hawk
           nose, twinkling eyes, flashing teeth. Flintlock pistol
           in his belt, crossbow across his back.

           Strapped to his side, a Samurai sword, carved hand-
           guard, razor-sharp, feather-light.

           Overheated in cloak, pantaloons, feathers and gloves,
           he clambers higher, swooning with fatigue.

           ANGLE

           Dragging himself to the top, he mops his brow.

           Seeing the peasant couple before him, he bows, hat
           sweeping the ground.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Greetings! I am Juan Sanchez
                       Villa-Lobos Ramirez, Chief
                       Metallurgist to King Philip II of
                       Spain.
                              (clicks heels)
                       At your service.

                                     HEATHER
                       Who -- ?

           Ramirez sees stars, looking down the trail.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       My God, man. That's a climb!

           Breathless, he replaces his hat, adjusting frills and
           furbelows.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What do you want?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Conner MacLeod

                                     MACLEOD
                       Maybe you've found him.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       The same Conner MacLeod wounded in
                       battle and driven from his village
                       five years ago?

           The Spaniard narrows his eyes. Something seems to
           seize MacLeod. He clutches his chest, unable to
           beathe. Heather's alarmed.

                                     HEATHER
                       Conner?

                                     MACLEOD
                              (gasping)
                       Heather, go in the house.
                              (she hesitates)
                       Do as I say, woman

           She backs up the hill and goes inside.

           Ramirez flashes wall-to-wall teeth. THUNDER reverber-
           ates down the valley.

                                     RAMIREZ
                              (re Heather)
                       A beautiful young woman. Is she your
                       wife?
                              (MacLeod nods)
                       Sad.

           MacLeod's temples are in a vise. Ramirez opens his
           tunic, tracing:

           A SCAR FROM NECK TO HIP

           with elegant finger.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       When I was young, a cart ran over
                       me. I should have died. But the
                       wound healed by itself.

           Stars explode inside MacLeod's head. The forge, the
           house, everything's spinning.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       The sensations you feel. It is
                       the Quickening.

           THUNDER CRACKS overhead. The storm breaks. HOWLING
           WIND. Ramirez's eyes blaze with unearthly light.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (shouting)
                       Who are you?

                                     RAMIREZ
                              (shouting)
                       We are the same, MacLeod. We are
                       brothers.

           Lightning etches their silhouettes against the rolling
           sky.

                                                       CUT TO:

           BRENDA

           moving through a squad-room toward:

           Moran on the phone, at his desk. Walls plastered with
           mug-shots. Steam pipes HISS & BANG.

           Seeing Brenda, he waves her to a seat with the receiver.

                       a bigger one next time. One
                       that'll bite him.

           He slams down the phone, eyeing Brenda.

                       Who pays?

                       Me.

           Moran likes it. He puts on his coat. Thay head for the
           door. Brenda stops.

                                     BRENDA
                       Frank, I left my purse. Go ahead.
                       I'll catch you by the elevator.

           Moran leaves. Brenda returns to the desk, opens a drawer,
           and finds what she's looking for:

           A bound, blue folder containing photos of Fasil's body, the
           sword, a copy of an interrogation report -- and:

           NASH'S MUG-SHOT

           It's the guy from the bar who fought the scarred giant.

                       I'll be damned. Russell Nash.

           She stares at the picture. Even in the harsh photo-flash,
           his face is compelling. The eyes, haunting, evoking time-
           less mystery.

           Moran's phone RINGS. She jumps.

           Glancing around, she jots down Nash's address, shuts the
           drawer, gets her purse and heads out.

           YUNG DOL KIM

           Alone in a rising elevator. An oriental with mahogany
           skin, obsidian eyes, guard's uniform and cap, carrying
           a huge sword.

           He watches the floor numbers, stops at 40. The doors
           open. He creeps out into:

           AN EMPTY, CARPETED HALLWAY

           Silence. Gliding past silent offices, he spots:

           A FIGURE WITH A SWORD IN AN ALCOVE

           Swinging, he slices off the figure's head. It rolls into
           the light. He stares down at it. It's plastic. He has
           destroyed a mannequin.

           Behind him, CROAKING LAUGHTER. Kim turns. The Kurgan
           appears with his weapon, amused by his little joke.

                                     KURGAN
                       Such a brave warrior
                              (suddenly ice-cold)
                       Let's see how you can handle
                       the real thing.

           The Kurgan charges, battering Kim into:

           AN OFFICE

           filled with rows of computer desks. The Kurgan goads Kim,
           side-stepping blows which SMASH files and phones. He's
           like a giant cat playing with a helpless mouse.

                                     KURGAN
                       you fight like an old woman, Kim.
                       You're disgusting.

           No longer amused, the Kurgan becomes a one-man wrecking-
           crew. He chases Kim, blitzing the office. The brilliance
           of his swordsmanship is staggering. unexpectedly:

           Kim drops his sword on the carpet. Behind him, through a
           window, the lights of Manhatten.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       What are you doing? Pick up your
                       sword.

                                     KIM
                       Tradition, once more?

                                     KURGAN
                       It is all we have

                                     KIM
                       It's no longer enough. I'm tired,
                       Kurgan. Four hundred years without
                       release. Let's be done with it. I
                       want peace.

                                     KURGAN
                       I will give you peace
                              (raising sword)
                       There can be only one.

           He cuts off Kim's head. A shimmering energy flashes between
           the corpse and Kurgan.

           He starts to glow. Computer-screens EXPLODE. From nowhere,
           a terrifying wind starts blowing. Pares fly. Water-coolers
           CRASH to the floor.

           The window IMPLODES, sucking Kim's body out into space. It
           falls 40 floors.

           In a boat, heading for an island in the middle of a loch.

           Resplendent in feathered hat, jewelled tunic, cape and
           boots, the Spaniard mans the oars.

           Alarmed, MacLeod sits facing the Spaniard, white-knuckling
           his claymore.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I don't like boats. I don't like
                       water. I'm a man, not a fish.

                       You complain endlessly. I wonder
                       if I'm wasting my time with you,
                       brother.

                       Stop calling me brother. You look
                       like a woman, you stupid haggis.

           Resting the oars, he takes snuff, inhaling deeply.
           LOUD SNEEZE. The boat rocks violently.

                                     MACLEOD

                       I can't swim -- you Spanish pea-
                       cock.

           Their angry voices carry across the lake.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       I am not Spanish. I am Egyptian.

                                     MACLEOD
                       You said you were from Spain.
                       You're a liar.

                       You smell like a dung-heap. You
                       have the manners of a goat. And
                       no knowledge of your potential.

           Gleefully, Ramirez starts violently rocking the boat.

           MacLeod is terrified. See-sawing wildly, he grabs for an
           oar. Ramirez suddenly throws him overboard.

           HUGE SPLASH. YELLING, MacLeod disappears, bobbing up,
           flailing his arms.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Help me. I'm drowning.

           Ramirez rows for the island.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       You can't drown, you fool. You're
                       immortal.

           MacLeod sinks in bubbles. Ramirez keeps rowing.

           Something is out there. A glowering head appears.

           IT'S MACLEOD

           rising up out of the lake. Spotting Ramirez, he wades
           cautiously to the shore.

           Covered in duck-weed and slime, he draws his claymore,
           creeping silently to within feet of the Spaniard's back.

           Slowly he raises his sword in both hands high over Ramirez's
           head. He's going to cut the bastard in half.

           With all his might, he brings the sword down. Something
           incredible happens.

           Like lightning, without looking back, Ramirez grabs his
           Samurai, parries the blow and is up and facing him in
           one blind motion.

           MacLeod's claymore flies from his hands.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       What took you so long?

           MacLeod watches his sword land on the beach 50 feet away.

                                     MACLEOD
                       This can't be. It's the devil's
                       work.

                                     RAMIREZ
                              (laughing)
                       You numbskull! Clod! You're no
                       better than the villagers who
                       threw you out.

           Livid, MacLeod splutters water, staring back at the loch,
           trying to make sense of what's happened.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept
                       it.

           2 fish wriggle free from the Highlander's tunic, flopping
           to the sand.

           Scowling at the Spaniard, he wishes this cup would pass
           from him, suspecting in his heart it will not.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (through his teeth)
                       I...hate...you...

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Good! it's a place to start

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD AND RAMIREZ SPARRING BY A WATERFALL

           CLANGING steel-on-steel. Rainbows of spray span the gorge.
           MacLeod is strong but awkward. Ramirez's Samurai SINGS in
           a brilliant display of swordsmanship.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       No, no, pendejo. Protect your
                       stupid head.

           MacLeod thrusts. Ramirez blocks.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       Concentrate! You can survive
                       anything but steel against your
                       throat. If your head leaves
                       your neck, it's over.

           Bellowing, MacLeod strikes. Ramirez deflects the blow with
           ease.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       Move your feet!
                              (advancing)
                       We must fight until only one
                       remains. There can be only
                       one.
                              (shouting)
                       Move your feet, I said!
                              (ducking a swing)
                       You are safe only on holy ground
                       None of us will violate that law.

           Exhausted, MacLeod staggers. Ramirez taunts him, jabbing
           him in the butt.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (yelling)
                       You over-dressed haggis. I'm
                       going to split you in half.

           Swinging his claymore, MacLeod goes berserk, missing Ramirez
           altogether, smashing brush, demolishing trees.

           Finally, he collapses, gulping for air in the grass. Ramirez
           stands over him.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Get up!

                                     MACLEOD
                       Go to hell. I've had enough.

           The Spaniard's expression changes. Switching tack, he sits 
beside
           his young charge, watching the THUNDERING falls.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       You must fight. You must learn to
                       keep your head. On you may depend
                       the fate of mortal men.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I don't care. i don't want it.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       None of us chose it.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Then how did it happen,
                       for God's sake?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       How does the sun know when
                       to come up?

           Ramirez points to SQUIRRELS CHATTERING under an oak.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       Those squirrels all look alike.

           MacLeod frowns.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       But once in a while, one is born
                       different. With blue eyes. And
                       fur white as snow. Others of its
                       kind try to destroy it or drive
                       it away.

           Flicking a bee off his pantaloons, he moves into the oak's 
shade.
           The squirrels scamper away.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       You must learn to conceal your
                       special gift. To harness your
                       power.
                              (a beat)
                       Until the time of the Gathering.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What gathering?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Questions, questions. Too much
                       talk.

           Slicing the air with his Samurai, he waves MacLeod up.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'm not moving.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Then I'll cut you where you sit.

           Wearily, MacLeod rises. The Spaniard advances, pounding
           MacLeod backwards.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       It is said that when only a few
                       of us are left, eons from now, we
                       will feel an irresistible pull to
                       a faraway land -- to fight for the
                       Prize.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MORAN

           smoking a cigar at his desk in the squad-room. Before him,
           a copy of the New York Times. Headline:
   
                     HEAD-HUNTER STALKS NEW YORK

           Bedsoe slumps in a chair.

                                     MORAN
                              (to Bedsoe)
                       You're sure it was Brenda?

                                     BEDSOE
                       In Nash's shop. Talking to him.

                                     MORAN
                              (half-smiling)
                       That ballsy broad. I never know
                       what's going on with her.
                              (thinking)
                       What did she and Nash talk about?
                       Did he say anything?

                                     BEDSOE
                       Yeah. He asked me if I liked
                       fish.

                                     MORAN
                       Fish -- ?

                                                       CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - MACLEOD AND RAMIREZ FIGHTING

           Various locations and times.

           Slowly, MacLeod improves, gaining control -- his blows,
           stronger, his coordination surer.

           Ramirez is pleased.

           HEATHER

           bartering for a flapping chicken in Jedburgh Market.
           In a group of SHOUTING WOMEN.

           Bright sunshine. FLAGS and BANNERS CRACK in the wind
           off the sea.

           Farmers sell cows and sheep. Crowds mill around. Open
           fires, Musicians and Hawkers.

           MacLeod and Ramirez watch Heather. Ramirez holds onto
           his hat. He buys an apple, bitting into it.

           Far up the valley, MacLeod's forge is a dot on the
           craggy mountainside.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       You will have no family. We
                       cannot have children.

           A BAND PLAYS. Girls dance around a maypole. MacLeod
           lovingly watches Heather bag a SQUAWKING BIRD.

                                     MACLEOD
                       That won't please Heather. I'll
                       tell you that for nothing.

           Ramirez shrugs. Heather holds up the sack.

                                     HEATHER
                              (calling)
                       Here's dinner. Be off now. I
                       fancy a new dress.

           They watch a Juggler.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       You must leave her, brother.

           MacLeod scowls. The Juggler drops his balls in the
           swirling wind. The CROWD WHISTLES.

           They arrive at a grassy arena. Huge men in kilts toss
           40-foot cabers to the CHEERS of the crowd.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       I was born 2,437 years ago. In
                       that time, I have had three wives.

           MacLeod tries to figure the man's age.

           A Whore sashays past, skirts billowing, ogling Ramirez.
           Graciously, he bows to her.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       The last was Shakiko, a Japanese
                       princess.
                              (indicating Samurai)
                       Her father, Kamakura, a genius,
                       made this for me in 593 B.C. It
                       is the only one of its kind.
                              (remembering)
                       Like his daughter.

           Drawing the Samurai, he tosses it to MacLeod, who
           catches it, testing its weight.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       When Shakiko died, I was
                       shattered. I would save you that
                       pain. Please -- let Heather go.

                                     MACLEOD
                       She's my wife, man. I love her.

           He sees her, gaily pushing through the crowd, ablaze
           with colored silks.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Then you will cause yourself great
                       anguish. I buried Shakiko with my
                       own hands.
                              (emotionally)
                       I had to go on, never again to hear
                       the sound of her voice, her laughter.
                       She left behind such a silence.

           Heather flies into MacLeod's arms, kissing him, showing
           him the cloth.

                                     HEATHER
                       D'you like it? Tell me true.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (eyeing Ramirez)
                       Aye, blossom. It's fine.

           Delighted, she dances around him, entwining him in the
           colored cloth.

                                                       CUT TO:

           WIND-WHIPPED WAVES ON THE STORMY NORTH SEA

           off the Scottish coast. Cold sun. Seagulls on the
           wind. Mountains against cumulus.

           Suddenly, on the shore:

           A GIANT STAG WITH SHINING ANTLERS

           rears up in the gorse. Head high, still, it watches:

           RAMIREZ AND MACLEOD WALKING ON THE BEACH

           MacLeod's freezing to death.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Now for the last of our training.

           The Spaniard points to the stag, shouting above the
           surf.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       Trust me. Let your mind feel the
                       stag. His blood. Coursing. His
                       heart. Beating.

           The SOUNDS OF THE TWO HEARTS POUND in his brain.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (enthralled)
                       I feel him.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       It is the Quickening. We are at
                       one with all living things.

           The stag bolts.

           MacLeod's perception is forever changed. The high-
           lands, the sea, the trees -- they're like old friends
           he'll never see the same way again.

                                      RAMIREZ
                               
                       When we first met, you felt ill.
                       Remember?

           Shivering, MacLeod nods.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       Did you ever feel that way
                       before?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Yes. When the MacLeods fought
                       the Frazers, and a black knight
                       ran me through. Only it was
                       different, more painful.

           Herons swoop low over the waves.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       That black knight was the Kurgan.
                       It is because of him that I sought
                       you out.
                              (MacLeod blinks)
                       There is great power in the Quickening.
                       But Nature has not given us equal shares.
                       Some, like you and the Kurgan, have more.

           MacLeod's ears are freezing.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       And when one of us takes another's
                       head, the victor becomes stronger.

           They clamber through rocks, away from the angry sea.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A DEEP-WATER POND SURROUNDED BY FERNS

           silent and old, under a dome of fir trees.

           MacLeod and Ramirez sit on the bank.

           Shedding his boots, yanking up his pantaloons, Ramirez steps
           gingerly into the pool, reacting to the cold.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Who is the Kurgan? Where does
                       he come from?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       The Kurgans were an ancient people
                       from the steppes of Russia. For
                       amusement, they tossed children
                       into pits with hungry dogs to
                       fight for meat.

           In the trees above, a blue jay arrives home with food for 
hungry
           mouths.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       I have fought the Kurgan 3 times.
                       In Babylon, Greece and China.

           He skips out of the water, drying his feet.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       The last time, I was lucky to
                       get away with my head.
                              (replacing boots)
                       The Kurgan is the strongest
                       of all immortals. He is
                       the perfect warrior.

           MacLeod shudders.

                                     RAMIREZ
                               
                       He cares about nothing or no-one.
                       He is completely evil.
                              (intensely)
                       If he wins the Prize, mortal men
                       will suffer an eternity of darkness
                       and slavery beneath his boot.

                                      MACLEOD
                       How do you fight such a savage?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       With heart, faith and steel.

                                                       CUT TO:

           RAMIREZ AND MACLEOD ON A WOODLAND PATH

           Above them, sunset changes green to gold. Ramirez
           draws his Samurai.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Now. Let us see what kind of
                       swordsman you have become.
                       On guard, pendejo.

           MacLeod's already moving, claymore spinning. He
           feints. Ramirez ducks.

           Off-balance, the Spaniard retreats, warding off deadly
           thrusts.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       In the end, there can be only
                       one.
                              (swinging)
                       It is the Prize for which we
                       all struggle. The Kurgan must
                       never win it. Alone, I cannot
                       stop him.
                              (retreating)
                       You may have a chance.

           Sure-footed, MacLeod tracks him through fallen timber.

                                     MACLEOD
                       If it came down to just us two,
                       would you take my head?

           Ramirez doesn't answer. MacLeod leaps forward, clay-
           more a WHISTLING RAZOR.

           Ramirez parries, but it's no good. The student has
           become the master.

           Losing his balance, Ramirez topples into a gully.
           MacLeod's on him in a second, blade against his throat.

           Breath rasping, they hold each other's gaze in green
           twilight. An eternity passes, then:

           MacLeod throws his sword away.

           Reaching out.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Give me your hand, brother.

           Ramirez smiles. His work done. MacLeod hauls him
           up.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD STRIDING THROUGH CENTRAL PARK

           Skaters on the ice. Kids fight with wooden swords in Sheep 
Meadow.

           Behind him, trying to look inconspicuous, the faithful Bedsoe 
dogs
           his tracks.

           Ahead in the trees. MacLeod sees:

           SUNDA KASTAGIR

           An elegant black African in blue-gold robes, head crowned 
with an
           ermine-trimmed cap.

           Standing on a stone bridge over the lake, he feeds bread to 
the
           ducks.

           MacLeod joins him, locking eyes with the African. They're 
both
           tense, ready for anything.

           Unexpectedly, Kastagir grins wall-to-wall teeth, grabbing 
MacLeod in
           a huge bear-hug.

                                     KASTAGIR
                       MacLeod. It's good to see you.
                       Seems like a hundred years.

                                        MACLEOD
                              (chuckling)
                       It has been a hundred years.

           Kastagir LAUGHS, removing a flask from his robe, offering it 
to
           MacLeod

                                     KASTAGIR
                       A little something to put
                       hair on your chest?

                                     MACLEOD
                              (suspiciously)
                       What is it?

                                     KASTAGIR
                       Boom-Boom

           MacLeod sniffs the open flask. It's a head-winder. The 
African
           appraises him critically.

                                     KASTAGIR
                               
                       You've become so strong, MacLeod.
                       Surely, you're not afraid of a
                       little Boom-Boom.
                              (twirling eyebrows)
                       Do you think I'm trying to
                       poison you?

           They LAUGH. MacLeod drinks. Retrieving the flask, the African

           takes a long swig.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       You're crazy, Kastagir.
                       You always were.

                                     KASTAGIR
                              (offering flask)
                       Have some more.

           MacLeod drinks. Kastagir feeds the ducks.

                                     KASTAGIR
                       The Gathering is here.
                       Time has almost caught us,
                       my friend.
                                     MACLEOD
                              (grinning)
                       has it? Do you think we should
                       go on?

                                     KASTAGIR
                       I think we should have a party.

           They take off across the park. Bedsoe emerges from
           bushes, following them.

                                                       CUT TO:


           MACLEOD AND KASTAGIR IN THE DUG_OUT BAR

           A steel-&-neon Village hang-out. Sawdust on the floor. It's 
late.
           They're drinking and talking, glancing over at:

           Bedsoe, alone in a nearby booth, spying on them from behind a 
New
           York Post.
                ----

           Unexpectedly, MacLeod and Kastagir appear at his table, 
sitting
           down.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Mind if we join you?

           Bedsoe folds his paper, gathering his wits.

           His cover's blown, but this might just be the opportunity 
he's been
           waiting for. He decides to play along.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Sundra Kastagir, meet --
                              (to Bedsoe)
                       What's your name?

                                     BEDSOE
                       Bedsoe.

                                     MACLEOD
                       He's a cop. He questioned me after
                       Fasil lost his head. He's trying to
                       pin a murder on me.
                              (winking)
                       If I'm guilty, they'll give me the
                       death penalty.

           They ROAR with laughter. Bedsoe's eyes narrow. He makes 
mental
           notes. A WAITRESS in pirate costume appears.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (to Bedsoe)
                       Want anything?

                                     BEDSOE
                       I'll have what they're having.

                                     KASTAGIR
                              (booming)
                       Bring more.

           She leaves.

           MONTAGE -- THE PARTY

           The waitress brings endless rounds of drinks. Amidst 
LAUGHTER,
           the trio gets drunk.

           Bedsoe starts having fun, finally going to work on Kastagir's 
flask
           of Boom-Boom.

           MACLEOD, KASTAGIR & BEDSOE

           completely potted. Their table is a forest of bottles.

                                     KASTAGIR
                              (to MacLeod)
                       D'you remember the night Washington
                       lost his teeth at Valley Forge?

                                     BEDSOE
                              (to Kastagir)
                       I was in Washington once.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (answering
                              Kastagir)
                       Freezing our asses off, crawling
                       around in the snow looking for a
                       set of wooden dentures.

                                     BEDSOE
                              (to MacLeod)
                       Which Washington are we
                       talking about?
                                     KASTAGIR
                       Ever fight a duel, Bedstead?

                                     BEDSOE
                       Bedsoe.

                                     KASTAGIR
                       Me, neither.
                              (indicating
                              MacLeod)
                       He has.

           Bedsoe tries to focus on MacLeod.

                                     MACLEOD
                       It was in 1797. I was using the name
                       Adrian Montagu. I insulted the wife
                       of a pompous Boston lawyer named Bassett.
                       Hotchkiss, his second, dragged me to
                       Beacon Common. I was very drunk.

                                     BEDSOE
                              (dazed)
                       1797 --?

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           red-eyed, dishevelled and weaving.

                                     MACLEOD O.S.
                       Bassett chose rapiers at dawn.

           BASSETT, a corpulent, ferret-faced lawyer, tests blades
           under a tree. Horses graze nearby.

           HOTCHKISS, a tall, lantern-jawed toadt, brushes his
           master's coat.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                       The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett, I
                       implore you.

                                     BASSETT
                       You are my second, Hotchkiss. I
                       am fighting this duel. Not you.

               He watches MacLeod trying to kill a bush.

                                     BASSETT
                               
                       See if the imbecile is ready.

           Rocketing over the grass, Hotchkiss keeps clear of
           MacLeod's unpredictable thrusts.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                       Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

           MacLeod whips around, almost dislocating his neck.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'm Bontagu. Not Massett.

           His wig slides over his eyes.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Christ, I've gone blind.

                                     BASSETT
                              (advancing)
                       On guard, sir.

           Hotchkiss waits for the kill. MacLeod can't see.

           Bassett runs him through.

           Bassett sees it's finished. Hotchkiss kisses his master,
           escorting him to his horse.

           Wound healing, head aching, MacLeod staggers up.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (slurring)
                       Bassett. Is that you?

           Dumbstruck, they wheel. He's waving at them.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                       You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

                                     BASSETT
                       I did not miss him, you idiot. I
                       ran him through.

           MacLeod blinks at his sword, wondering what it is.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                       He is still standing, sir.

           Shoving Hotchkiss aside, Bassett lunges, running
           MacLeod through again. MacLeod falls down.

                                     MACLEOD (O.S.)
                       Bassett kept running me through.
                       I'd fall down.

           More frenzied attempts by Bassett, each time receiving
           kisses from Hotchkiss.

                                     MACLEOD (O.S.)
                               
                       Hotchkiss would embrace Bassett.
                       They'd head for their horses. I'd
                       stagger up.

           Eyes zooming, MacLeod rocks on his heels.

           Bassett thinks it's a nightmare. Hotchkiss shoves a
           pistol into his hand.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                              (screeching)
                       Shoot him! Shoot him in the head!

           Finally, grasping what's happening, MacLeod raises his
           hand.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Stop, sir. I beseech you.

           Bassett tries to cock the gun, Hotchkiss urging him on.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       I apologize, Mr. Bassett, for
                       calling your wife a bloated wart-
                       hog.
                              (unsteady)
                       I trust honor has been satisfied,
                       and bid you good day.

           He staggers off into the mist. Hotchkiss tries to
           wrench the gun from Bassett.

                                     HOTCHKISS
                       Let me do it. You botched the
                       whole thing.

           Wrestling it from him, Bassett wheels in circles, look-
           ing for someone to kill.

           Suspecting it will be he, Hotchkiss flees. Bassett
           raises the pistol and FIRES.

                                                       CUT TO:

           KASTAGIR

           howling with LAUGHTER in the Dug-Out Bar. Zooming, Bedsoe
           staggers up, knocking over bottles.

                                     BEDSOE
                              (slurring)
                       I wanna thank --

           He blinks at them. He can't remember anybody's name.
           HICCUPING, he weaves off, MUMBLING.

                                     BEDSOE
                               
                       Wonderful evening...

           No one notices he's gone. The pirate-waitress looms over
           the table, Kastagir and MacLeod squint up at her.

           Imagining they're in another century, they adopt Long John
           Silver voices.

                                     KASTAGIR
                       Avast, ye bonny wench.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Bring us two barrels of scurvy and
                       a bucket of cleats.

                                     WAITRESS
                       Okay, that's it, guys. You're
                       history.

           She's right. The party's over.

                                                       CUT TO:

           KASTAGIR AND MACLEOD

           on swings in a children's playground at dawn, rocking back 
and
           forth. Both men are sober.

           A bitter wind tosses newspaper, swirls leaves. Skyscrapers 
blaze in
           the rising sun.

                                     MACLEOD
                       There are 3 of us left. You,
                       me and the Kurgan.

                                     KASTAGIR
                       Are you suggesting we join
                       forces against him?

           MacLeod watches a JOGGER flounder by.

                                     KASTAGIR
                               
                       Ramirez filled your head with
                       nonsense. Sooner or later. you
                       and I would have to fight.
                              (beat)
                       Nothing personal. I've always
                       liked you, actually.

           He points a finger at MacLeod, pulling an imaginary trigger.

                                     KASTAGIR
                               
                       Boom-Boom.

           MacLeod gets up and walks away. Kastagir swings in the wind.

                                                       CUT TO:

           RAMIREZ AND HEATHER

           having lunch in the MacLeod home. A WOODEN STAIRCASE runs
           from ground to 3rd floor.

           Unexpectedly, Ramirez's body jolts violently. His face
           contorts, voice strangled.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       Run, Heather --!

           Suddenly, the front door EXPLODES, splintering in fragments.
           Sword in hand, eyes burning, the Kurgan surges in.

           Heather races back. Ramirez dives for his sword on the
           table. The Kurgan swings, barely missing Ramirez, chopping
           the table in two.

           Ramirez counters, his Samurai slicing the Kurgan's throat,
           severing his vocal chords.

           GARGLING in fury, the Kurgan clutches his neck. Warding off
           the Spaniard's attack, he reels backward up the stairs.

                                                       CUT TO:

           RAMIREZ AND THE KURGAN

           fighting on the staircase. Savage forces are unleashed.
           Sparks fly from CLANGING blades. Outside, THUNDER CRACKS
           overhead.

           Despite his wound, the Kurgan fights like a mad dog. Ramirez
           loses ground.

           The stone house is reduced to rubble. All that remains is
           one wall and the staircase rising to nowhere.

           Outmatched, Ramirez retreats up the stairs. Unstoppable,
           the Kurgan follows.

           HEATHER

           paralyzed with fear, crouches by a wall, watching the 
desperat
           battle -- Ramirez and the wounded giant silhouetted against 
an
           electric sky.

           RAMIREZ AND THE KURGAN

           hanging in space at the top of the stairs. Ramirez can retrea

           no further. The Kurgan runs him through. LIGHTNING sears the
           sky.

           Gasping, the Spaniard sags to his knees, sword falling 3 
stori
           to the ground. Below, Heather SCREAMS.

           Ramirez tries to rise. The Kurgan grabs his hair, pulling him

           close.

                                     KURGAN
                       The Highlander. Where is he?

           Ramirez's blade has turned the Kurgan's voice to a
           METALLIC GARGLE.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       You're too late. I have prepared
                       him for you.

                                     KURGAN
                       You waste your time. He is nothing.
                              (indicates Heather)
                       Who is the woman?

                                     RAMIREZ
                       She's mine.

                                     KURGAN
                       Not for much longer.

                                     RAMIREZ
                       I can't hear you, Kurgan. What's
                       wrong with your voice?

           Ramirez SPITS in his face. The Kurgan goes mad, raising
           his weapon.

                                     KURGAN
                       There can be only one.

           He cuts off Ramirez's head. A SHIMMERING CLOUD engulfs
           him.

           He kicks the corpse off the stairs. Turning, he stares
           down at Heather shivering by the wall. His pitiless eyes
           burn into her.

           The next second, the remaining wall gives way, taking the
           staircase with it. Surprised, the Kurgan disappears under
           a mass of timber and stone.

           Deathly stillness. Clouds cast a pall over the ruins.

           Cautiously, Heather inches forward, staring down at the
           debris, trying to comprehend what's happened. Suddenly:

           THE KURGAN'S HEAD ROCKETS OUT OF THE RUBBLE

           grabbing her by the throat. She SCREAMS. He RISES.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD

           in his silver room, studying Ramirez's hat in the glass
           case. Rachel enters, standing behind him. MacLeod
           doesn't move.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What are you looking at?

                                     RACHEL
                       The eyes in the back of your head.

           Rising, he heads for the door. Rachel follows him.

                                     RACHEL
                               
                       People are asking about you. What
                       am I supposed to say?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Tell them I'm immortal.

           MACLEOD

           In an overcoat, carrying a wrapped gift, walking through
           his closed antique shop, followed by Rachel.

                                     RACHEL
                       Would you listen to me for one
                       moment, please?
                              (he nods)
                       You can't hide your feelings from
                       me. I've known you too long.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What feelings?

                                     RACHEL
                       How about loneliness?

           He conceals his true reaction.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'm not lonely. I've got everything
                       I need, right here.

                                     RACHEL
                       No, you don't. You refuse to let
                       anyone love you.

                                    MACLEOD
                       Love is for poets. I have other
                       things to do.
                              (kissing her forehead)
                       You're such a romantic, Rachel.
                       You always were.

           BEDSOE ON STAKE-OUT

           parked outside a building in Murray Hill, still suffering
           from his evening in the Dug-Out Bar. His head's killing
           him, he's got the shakes and he needs a shave.

           Balancing a cup of coffee, he tries to work an Alka-Seltzer
           into a container of water, inadvertently hitting the horn
           with his elbow. It BLARES.

           Grabbing his temples, he drops the water, spilling scalding
           coffee into his groin.

                                     BEDSOE
                       Oh, shit...

           Unnoticed, MacLeod enters the building.

                                                       CUT TO:

           BRENDA

           in bra and panties in her bedroom.

           Finishing make-up, brushing her hair. Nervous, she
           slips into a sexy dress and boots, studying the effect
           from different angles.

           Adjusting her hair, she adds a lizard belt, clinching it
           tight around her narrow waist.

           Satisfied, she walks out into:

           A glass and chrome living room.

           Dinner set for two. Agitated, she opens the table-
           drawer. Inside: A pistol.

           She cracks it open. It's loaded.

           Replacing it, she opens a cabinet. A hidden tape-
           recorder is set to go.

           BUZZER. It's the front door.

           Starting the recorder, she shuts the cabinet, takes a
           breath, and opens the door.

           It's Russell Nash.

           In suit, tie and overcoat, with gift-wrapped package and
           bottle.

           Flushed, she can't think what to say. Impulsively, she
           heads for the bedroom.

           coat, glancing around.

           IN THE BEDROOM

           She stares at her rigid image in the mirror.

           Opening the bottle, he sits on the sofa.

                       Aye, love. I will

                                     HEATHER
                       I wanted to have your children.

           She collapses, clinging to him.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (huskily)
                       They would have been strong and
                       fine.
                                                           
                                   HEATHER
                              (struggling)
                       Don't see me, Conner. Let me die
                       in peace.

           Heart breaking, he rocks her. Breathing faster, she
           closes her eyes.

                                     HEATHER
                               
                       Where are we?

                                     MACLEOD
                       We're in the Highlands. Where
                       else? Running down a mountain-
                       side.

           She smiles, young again.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       The sun's shining. It's not cold.
                       We'll swim in the loch, maybe.

           She fades.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       You've got your sheepskins on.
                       And the boots I made for you.

           She dies. He squeezes her tighter, blinking back
           tears.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       When I met you at the fair, you
                       said: "You're all muck and
                       muscle." Then you smiled. What a
                       beauty.

           Grief overwhelms him. Lowering her gently, he closes
           her eyes, taking the doll from her hand. He kisses her
           cheek.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Good night, my bonnie Heather.
                       You were always beautiful to me.

           He sobs.

           laying Heather to rest at sunset on a hill above the
           farm. His horse stands under a tree.

           Drawing his claymore, he sinks it deep into the earth,
           marking Heather's grave.

           He buckles on Ramirez's Samurai, eyes raking the
           heavens.

                       will never be another.

           Grimly, he leads his horse down the mountain.

           Left behind, his claymore. Carved into the blade,
           glowing in the dying sun, the name:

           remind him of distant places and times, intensifying
           his painful isolation.

           VOICES and SOUNDS scramble his brain, gathering in
           volume:

           The pressure's too much. BELLOWING, MacLeod erupts.

           Picking up a vase, he spins round in fury, flinging it
           against a wall. It SHATTERS in a million pieces.

           MONTAGE: The same frustration vented bacward through
           the centuries. The vast today, marble statue in 1880,
           a wine bottle at a French castle wall, the beer glass
           at his attackers in the Scottish tavern.

           GLASS FRAGMENTS RING IN THE STILLNESS

           falling to the floor. MacLeod struggles to control his
           feelings. Sitting down on a couch, he stares out of the
           window. His hands are shaking.

                       Adrian Montagu left his property
                       to Hamilton Kopp.

                       Even in the old days, if somebody
                       left you something, you had to
                       sign a receipt.

           scatters in terror.

           Hearing distant SIRENS, the Kurgan looks for a ride,
           spotting the Chevy on the curb.

           Bellowing, he charges, sword swinging, opening the

           Prying it open with his bare hands, he sees the old

                       that alley.

                                     MATUNAS
                              (screeching)
                       The freak was stabbing me to
                       death. I'll never forget his
                       face. He had a scar right across
                       his throat.
                              (re: photo)
                       And that ain't him.

           Moran sags onto the bed.

                                     MATUNAS
                               
                       Depressed?

           Moran shrugs.

                                     MATUNAS
                               
                       You don't know grunt about
                       depressed
                              (sits up painfully)
                       I got me a .357, a trunkful of
                       shotguns, three big-bore battle
                       rifles and ammo out the ass. I
                       can't protect myself.
                              (shouting)
                       I ain't safe -- !
                              (wincing)
                       That weirdo with the sword, man.
                       He got up and stabbed me after I
                       put enough lead in him to drop a
                       rhino.
                              (collapsing)
                       Don't talk to me about depressed.

           Moran rises wearily.

                                     MORAN
                       Could you work with an artist and
                       come up with a picture of the guy?

                                    MATUNAS
                       Sure.

           Moran and Bedsoe head for the door.

                                     MATUNAS
                               
                       Hey, cop.

           Moran turns.

                                     MATUNAS
                               
                       I know you think I'm nuts. But
                       there's something else I gotta
                       tell you.

           lighting candles in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

           Beside the altar. Soaring columns, stained-glass win-
           dows. People pray. Priests glide about.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (1st candle)
                       For you, my bonnie Heather. Happy
                       birthday.
                              (lights 2nd)

                       Take care of her, you overdressed
                       haggis.

           Moving to an empty pew, he sits silently, lost in the
           past.

           In front of him, the candles blur. The ceiling starts
           to spin. Turning, MacLeod see the Kurgan beside him
           in the pew.

           He's become a punk-rocker, straightened his hair, dyed
           it orange, and put on make-up.

           A line of safety-pins dangle from the scar across his
           throat. His mocking eyes roam the church.

                                     KURGAN
                       Kastagir is gone. Only you and I
                       remain. Chatting together here on
                       holy ground.

           He leers.

                                     MACLEOD
                       You're revolting. What d'you think

                       I am disguised. This way people
                       will not recognize me.

           MacLeod is a coiled spring. 2 MATRONS cross themselves,
           heading down the aisle.

                                     KURGAN

                       Happy Hallowe'en ladies!

           Scared witless, they leave.

                                     KURGAN
                       It was destined that the board
                       would be cleared for the real
                       players.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I feel something coming from
                       you. You're trying to conceal
                       it from me. What is it?

                                     KURGAN
                       I conceal nothing.

           MacLeod's glittering eyes fix on the Kurgan's safety-
           pinned throat-scar.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Ramirez's blade did not cut
                       deeply enough. He was right
                       about you. You're slime.

                                     KURGAN
                              (harshly)
                       Ramirez was an effete snob.
                       He died on his knees.

           Gloating, he remembers:

           THE KURGAN

           clutching Heather's neck, rising up from the ruins of
           MacLeod's 16th century stone house. SCREAMING, she tries
           to break free of his grip. It's hopeless.

                                     KURGAN V.O.
                       I took his head and raped his woman
                       before his body was even cold.

           Throwing Heather down, he rips off her clothes. She
           CRIES OUT brokenly. There's no one to hear.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE KURGAN

           eyeballing MacLeod's stricken face in St. Patrick's.
           Understanding dawns in his lurid eyes.

                                     KURGAN
                       I see. Ramirez lied. The woman
                       was not his. She was yours.
                              (leering)
                       And she never told you. I wonder
                       why. Perhaps I gave her something
                       you never could, and secretly she
                       yearned for my return.

           On his feet, MacLeod shakes with fury.

                                     MACLEOD
                       You sick bastard -- !

           He lunges for the sword inside his coat. The Kurgan's
           hands fly up in mock-horror.

                                     KURGAN
                       Holy ground, Highlander. Remember
                       what Ramirez taught you.

                                     MACLEOD
                       You can't stay in here forever.

                                     KURGAN
                              (smiling)
                       You're weak, Highlander. You will
                       always be weaker than I.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I'll be out front. Waiting.

           MacLeod leaves by the front doors. Metallic laughter
           rings through the church. Worshippers are outraged.
           A bald PRIEST confronts the Kurgan.

                                     PRIEST
                       This is the house of God. People
                       are trying to pray. You're dis-
                       turbing them.

           The Kurgan kisses the Priest's hand noisily, dropping
           to his knees.

                                     KURGAN
                       Forgive me, father. I am a worm.

           Patting the Priest's head for luck, the Kurgan boogies
           down the aisle in hobnail boots.

           Safety-pins jangling at his throat, he heads for the
           back exit.

           He leaps out into the night. The DOOR BANGS. The
           Priest crosses himself.

           MacLeod looks at Brenda. She's done her homework, and
           she's not going to leave. He makes a decision.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Come on.

                       some or not?

           She nods. He pours drinks, handing her one. Taking
           her arm, he leads her down a hall.

           MACLEOD AND BRENDA ENTER HIS SILVER ROOM

           Her expression changes to awe.

           The room is filled with suits of armor, Italian statuettes,
           Persian fetishes, and a thousand other oddities from a
           hundred eras.

           The sight is overwhelming.

                                     BRENDA
                       My God.

           Astonished, she strolls around, touching artifacts. He
           watches her.

                             (continuing; pointing)
                       Is that claymore real?

           He lets go. Years of isolation melt in the sound of
           her voice.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Yes.

           Brenda runs her hand along the delicate weaving of a
           Carolingian tapestry.

           She turns and faces him.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I have been alive for four and a
                       half centuries. And I cannot die.

                              (nervously)
                       Right. And I'm an Amazon princess
                       sent by Martians to save the world.

           He's caressing her with his eyes, confushing her again.

           Crossing to a glass table, he picks up an ornate stiletto.

                                     BRENDA
                              (continuing; alarmed)
                       What are you going to do with that?

           He offers her the hilt.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Take it.

           Reluctantly, her fingers close over the handle.

           Suddenly, MacLeod kneels before her, tearing open his
           shirt, exposing his chest.

           In one blurred move, he grabs her fist. She tries to drop
           the dagger, but his grip is like steel.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       I am Conner MacLeod of the Clan
                       MacLeod. I was born in 1518, in
                       the village of Glamis, on the
                       shores of Loch Shiel.
                              (tightening his grip)
                       And I am immortal.

           In a flash, he pulls her fist forward:

           Plunging the stiletto into his heart.

           Letting go, she screams. He collapses, moaning.
           Freaking out, Brenda watches:

           MacLeod pulls the dagger out of his heart.

           The wound heals. He stands up. Brenda is lost.

                                                       CUT TO:

           BRENDA AND MACLEOD AT THE DINNER TABLE

           She's flushed, excited in the presence of living history.
           MacLeod pours brandy, getting comfortable. Brenda watches
           him draw on his cigar.

                       Short. French. Wore his hat

           She spots the silver-frame photo of MacLeod with a

           Brenda frowns. Slowly realizing, she points O.S.

                       Yes. She was an orphan. I can't
                       have children. I adopted her.

                       Yes.

           Reality hits her like a bolt. She's alone with an immortal, 
holding a

                       I love you.
                              (a beat)
                       But you're locked away in your
                       own private world of memories.
                       No future. Unable to care.
                       Afraid.

           THE KURGAN IN THE CHILDREN'S ENCLOSURE

           Surrounded by kids petting sweet, furry things. He
           peers through the trees.

           AT THE PENGUIN-POOL

           Excited kids jostle and SHOUT. MacLeod is in turmoil.

                                     BRENDA
                       You know what's kind of weird? Most people
                       are afraid to die. That's not your
                       problem. You're afraid to live.
                              (rises)
                       Take care of yourself
                              (kisses him)
                       Don't lose your head.

           She turns and walks for the exit.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE KURGAN

           watches Brenda leave. A KID hands him a rabbit. He
           strokes it. It struggles, biting him hard. Flinging
           it from him, he takes off.

           BRENDA GETS OUT OF HER APARTMENT ELEVATOR

           It's dark and late. The building's empty.

           Jostling an armful of books, she starts down the corridor.

           Turning a corner she suddenly FREEZES.

           The books tumble out of her arms onto the floor.

           Standing at the end of the corridor, smiling, is the Kurgan,
           in black leather, buckles and stomping-boots. His hair is
           shaved into an orange mohawk.

                                     KURGAN
                       Hello, pretty.

           The Kurgan starts for her, carrying a huge, broadsword.

           Brenda screams and runs for her apartment.

           The Kurgan is in no hurry.

           Brenda looks back at the Kurgan. Crying in fear, she
           frantically tries to get her keys into the lock of her
           apartment.

           The Kurgan is nearly upon her.

           Brenda throws open the door, runs inside, and locks it.

           Beat.

           CRASH!!

           THE KURGAN hammers his sword deep into the wood of the
           door.

                                     BRENDA
                              (crying)
                       Oh, God...

           He strikes again. And again. Splinters smack
           everywhere.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       Go away! Oh, God, go away!

           Hysterical, Brenda sinks to the floor against her
           desk.

           THE KURGAN stands back and gives the door a last two-
           fisted swing.

           Brenda screams.

           The door collapses.

           The hellish figure stands over her in the doorway.

                                     BRENDA
                               
                       For God's sake...

                                     KURGAN
                       There is no God. Only me.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A SPEEDING CAR RACES THROUGH THE CITY

           The Kurgan takes a cassette from his pocket, slotting
           it in. DEAFENING MUSIC fills the car:

           It's the KURGAN'S ANTHEM.

           Brenda is trying to get her bearings.

           MUSIC SHRIEKS, her ears burst. Cars rocket past like
           bullets. Speedometer 90 and climbing.

           Brenda stares at the Mohawk abortion with his foot to
           the floor.

                                     BRENDA
                              (shouting)
                       Stop. Please, stop.

           The Kurgan erupts in maniacal laughter.

           Brenda hangs on for dear life. Everything's a blur.
           Any second, she's going to die.

           Engine WHINING, MUSIC POUNDING, eyeballing his captive:

           The Kurgan runs chicken down the avenue, not stopping
           for red lights.

           Flat-out, stopping for nothing, getting his rocks off,
           shrieking like a banshee.

           In his wake, a maelstrom of wreckage and terror.

           ANTHEM BLARING, he flings the Cutlass into the dark
           mouth of the Mid-Town Tunnel.

           Brenda screams.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD SLUMPED ON A COUCH IN HIS LIVING ROOM

           replaying a RECORDED message:

                                     KURGAN'S VOICE
                       She gave me your number. She
                       didn't want to at first. Listen.

           Brenda sobs.

                                     KURGAN
                       She's hot, Highlander. I think
                       she wants me. What part of her
                       shall I cut off first?

           More CRYING. MacLeod shuts it off. Rachel at the
           door.

                                     RACHEL
                       The endless killing has driven
                       him mad.

           Rising, he puts on his coat and checks his Samurai,
           holding her face in his hands.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Rachel, there are some instructions
                       in the desk drawer. I want you to
                       follow them. There's a power-of-
                       attorney for you. You'll have
                       everything you need.

                                     RACHEL
                              (realizing)
                       You're not coming back.

           Silence.

                                     RACHEL
                       Even if you kill him, you're not
                       coming back. Are you?

           He sits her down, holding her hands.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (gently)
                       Sweet Rachel, you always knew
                       this would happen.
                              (a beat)
                       Russell Nash dies tonight. One
                       way or the other. It's time.

                                     RACHEL
                              (crying)
                       There's no one in my life but
                       you.

           MacLeod gives her a handkerchief.

                                   MACLEOD
                       You still have a lot of life to
                       live.

                                     RACHEL
                       I'm afraid.

                                     MACLEOD
                       A beautiful woman like you
                       need never be alone or afraid.

           He stands up, smiling down at her.

                                     RACHEL
                       What about Brenda?

                                     MACLEOD
                       He's given me an hour.

                                     RACHEL
                       I understand.

           He kisses her, hugging her tight.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Goodbye, dearest Rachel. My
                       daughter. My good friend.

           He leaves. Long silence. Tears roll down her cheeks.

                                     RACHEL
                              (whispering)
                       Goodbye, Russell Nash.

                                                       CUT TO:

           CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK AT NIGHT

           Bitter cold. A sign reads:

                               CLOSED
                            NO ADMITTANCE

           Breakers pound the beach. WIND HOWLS through the park.

           The roller-coaster's a prehistoric monster. Light
           flickers from a merry-go-round pavilion.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE KURGAN ASSEMBLING HIS SWORD

           Inside the pavilion, slotting the blade into place.

           Sprawled in sawdust, Brenda stares at carved wooden
           horses. Shivering, she sits up, trying to figure out
           where she is.

           The Kurgan looms over her, blade gleaming.

                                     KURGAN
                       A nice sleep, yes?

           She tries to rise. He sets his sword-point at her
           throat.

                                     KURGAN
                       One move, whore, and I'll slice
                       you to bits.

           He forces her back. She's freezing and terrified.

                                     BRENDA
                       You're an animal.

                                     KURGAN
                       I am Kurgan. Warrior eternal.
                       I have carved my name in the
                       flesh of Venetian princes, raped
                       the daughters of Attila the Hun,
                       and set ablaze the seven hills
                       of Rome.
                              (grating)
                       You are nothing. Born and dead
                       in the blink of my eye.
                              (a beat)
                       You are my slave, and will give
                       me whatever pleasure I demand.

                                     BRENDA
                       You puffed-up turd. You don't have
                       the equipment.

           She spits at him. He glares in fury.

                                     BRENDA
                       Come on. Kill me. You're going
                       to do it anyway.
                              (a beat)
                       What's the matter? No balls?

        The Kurgan smiles. She's clever, this bitch.

                                     KURGAN
                       I see. You try to anger me, so
                       I kill you before you lover
                       arrives. Then I have no advantage.

                                     BRENDA
                              (staggers up)
                       I'm nothing to him. Just a roll
                       in the hay.

           Breath billowing, mohawk trembling, he wonders if
           that's true. Suddenly he freezes, staring out into
           the dark.

                                     KURGAN
                       He cares for you. More than you
                       think. I can feel his approach.
                              (a beat)
                       My advantage is real.

           Grabbing a hammer, she hurls it at him. He bats it away
           with his sword, slapping her across the face.

           MacLeod appears, samurai in hand.

           The Kurgan drags Brenda up by the hair, hand over her
           mouth, blade resting across her neck. MacLeon starts
           forward.

                                     KURGAN
                        Stop, or I'll cut her.

           Tense as a cobra, MacLeod stops.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Let her go.

                                     KURGAN
                       I don't think so.

           He yanks her head farther back, eyes on the Highlander.

                                     KURGAN
                       If you care what happens to her.
                       put down your sword and walk away.
                              (pointing)
                       Over there.

            Brenda fights to break his grip. The Kurgan chokes
           her. MacLeod puts down his sword.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       Very good. Now move.

           MacLeod moves.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       Kneel down, neck exposed.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Let her go first.

                                     KURGAN
                       Do you think thousands of years
                       have made me an idiot?
                              (barking)
                       Kneel -- !

           Boiling, he obeys.

           Hurling Brenda away from him, the Kurgan swings mur-
           derously at MacLeod's exposed neck.

           Like a panther, MacLeod rolls, grabs his samurai, and
           meets the ROARING BLADE with a THUNDEROUS CLANG and a
           shower of sparks.

           MacLeod leaps to his feet.

                                     KURGAN
                               
                       So now it ends. Generation upon
                       generation. Millions of miles.

           Wielding his sword like a scythe, MacLeod attacks,
           driving the kurgan back in showers of sparks. BLADES
           CLANG in the gloom.

           The Kurgan blocks his parries brilliantly. They lock
           sword-hilts, face to face.

                                     BRENDA
                       Kill him! Kill him!

           The Kurgan hurls him across the pavilion. He lands
           on his back, winded.

           Yelling, the Kurgan charges, driving MacLeod out into
           the night. Brenda follows fearfully.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A SAVAGE BATTLE RAGING THROUGH THE PARK

           Between the reptilian day-glo nightmare and the 466-
           year-old Highlander.

           Roller-coaster pilings are severed and collapse.
           Arcades demolished, ferris-wheel chairs hacked to
           bits. Energy crackles all around them.

           They battle beneath a huge red wooden fruit. Painted
           on it in lurid colors:

                           FUN IN THE BIG APPLE

           Circling, MacLeod's eyes burn into his ancient enemy.

                                     MACLEOD
                       I can sense it again. What I felt
                       in the church. What are you hiding?

                                     KURGAN
                       Nothing.

           They grapple like primordial beasts, sweat pouring off
           their bodies.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (realizing)
                       It's fear. That's what I feel.
                       You're afraid of me. Kurgan, you're
                       afraid of me.
                              (hurling him back)
                       That's why you needed the woman.
                       You didn't think you could take me.

                                   KURGAN
                              (hoarsely)
                       Lies -- !

           His rabid eyes can't hide the truth. MacLeod charges
           again, wielding Ramirez's sword full-strength.

           The Kurgan's arms feel like lead. Gasping, he re-
           treats to:

           The icy beach.

           MacLeod beating him back.

                                     MACLEOD
                       All these years, I thought I was
                       running from you. But it was
                       myself.
                              (contempuously)
                       You're not the perfect warrior.
                       You're a coward.

           MacLeod batters him relentlessly. Each blocked blow
           saps Kurgan further.

           Beaten, he stands, gulping for air. MacLeod faces him,
           samurai poised for another blow.

           The Kurgan can't get it up. Brenda's rooted to the
           spot.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (continuing, to the Kurgan)
                       For Heather, Ramirez, Kastagir and
                       all the others I never knew. And
                       last, for the Highlander MacLeod of
                       the Clan MacLeod --

           He raises his Samurai.

                                     MACLEOD
                       There can be only one.

           Blade a WHISTLING blur:

           He cuts off the Kurgan's head.

           Transfixed, Brenda watches a sparkling energy leave the
           corpse and engulf MacLeod. Standing up:

           MacLeod glows all hues of the rainbow.

           His hair stands on end. Color erupts from his eyes.
           He's like a roman candle against the waves. The WIND
           HOWLS.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (continuing;
                               screaming)
                       Mother of God -- !

           Terrified, she tries to touch him. It's like his skin's
           on fire.

                                     BRENDA
                              (shouting)
                       What is it -- ?

           Glowing, he falls to his knees in the sand.

                                     MACLEOD
                       The Prize. It is the Prize.

           Suddenly, everything's still. His eyes probe the darkness.
           There's a TERRIFYING EXPLOSION.

           Brenda watches MacLeod's body transform into many different
           people. His voice ECHOES over the surf.

                                     MACLEOD
                        Everything's alive. The
                       Quickening overpowers me.
                              (becoming
                              Ramirez)
                       All resistance is gone.
                       I am generations being born
                       and dying.
                              (becoming
                              Fasil)
                       I am night air, breathing.
                              (becoming
                              unknown people)
                       The life-force smothers me.
                              (becoming
                              the Kurgan)
                       I am all of them.
                              (becoming
                              himself)
                       I can feel everything

           She's terrified. His form shifts and changes before her.
           Waves CRASH on the beach.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       I can feel your love. The blood
                       in your veins.

           He reaches out to her.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Your fear of me.

                                                       CUT TO:

           FIRE TRUCK

           converging on MacLeod's antique shop.

           SIRENS SCREAMING. It's a blazing inferno. Cops hold
           back crowds. Firemen direct hoses. Tears in her eyes:

           Rachel moves through the crowd.

           She's carrying the silver-framed 1952 photo of herself
           with Nash. Beams split in cascades of sparks.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MORAN

           stands on the sidewalk. T.V. crews film the blaze.
           Cops hold back gawkers behind barriers. Seeing Rachel,
           Moran takes her arm.

                                     MORAN
                       I'm sorry. We couldn't get him out.

                                     RACHEL
                       I know.

                                     MORAN
                              (eyeing her)
                       The Head-Hunter got another one tonight.

                                    RACHEL
                              (anxiously)
                       What was his name?

                                     MORAN
                       Some guy named Kruger.

           Relieved, she closes her eyes for a moment. MacLeod has won.

                                     MORAN
                       Why d'you ask, Miss Ellenstein?

                                     RACHEL
                       You can call me Rachel if
                       you want.

                                     MORAN
                       Rachel's a nice name
                              (seeing photo)
                       What's that?

           She shows it him.

                                     MORAN
                               
                       Nash.
                              (she nods)
                       Who's the pretty young girl?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiling)
                       Would you like to get some coffee?

           Puzzled, he looks at the photo, then at her. Taking his arm, 
she
           walks him off down the street.

           Behind them, the inferno RAGES

                                                       CUT TO:

          THREE U.P.S. GUYS

           unloading MacLeod's aquarium off a truck.

           Reeling under its weight, they stagger up the steps
           of a brownstone, ringing the bell repeatedly.

           After an eternity, Bedsoe appears in striped pajamas,
           rubbing his eyes.

                                     UPS GUY
                       You Bedsoe?

                                     BEDSOE
                       Yeah.

                                     UPS GUY
                       Delivery. Fish. Heavy. Get
                       out of the way.

           Pushing past him with the tank, they disappear inside.

                                     UPS GUY'S VOICE
                       Where d'you want it?

                                     BEDSOE
                       Wait a minute. There must be some
                       mistake. I didn't order any fish.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MACLEOD ON THE FAN-TAIL OF A LINER, ALONE

           Bright sun, gulls astern. Passengers bask by a pool. Waiters 
serve
           drinks.

           He stares at the rolling ocean. Everything is different. 
There's a
           power and growing confidence in his eyes.

           Brenda appears in a summer dress, carrying glasses and an 
open
           bottle. She joins him, setting them on the rail, watching him 
in
           silence.

                                     MACLEOD
                       A man named Armando Rafael Garcia,
                       right now, is planning a military
                       coup in Honduras. Many people may
                       die.

                                   BRENDA
                       How do you know?

                                     MACLEOD
                              (searching
                              for words)
                       I can't explain it. I just do.

                                     BRENDA
                       You mean like when the phone
                       rings sometimes, and before you
                       answer, you know who's calling?

                                     MACLEOD
                       Something like that. I'm just
                       learning about it --
                              (pause)
                       In Paris, Jean-Robert Tousche
                       and Sylvie Arnaud live in adjoining
                       houses.
                              (turning to her)
                       They're deeply in love, but they
                       never speak to each other.

           The breeze stirs her hair. The implications of what he's 
saying
           astound her.

                                     BRENDA
                       What are you going to do
                       with all this power?

                                     MACLEOD
                       I don't know. I think I can help
                       the people in Honduras, the lovers
                       in paris.
                              (shakes his head)
                       I'm not sure how yet. I don't
                       fully grasp it.

           Gulls hang on the wind. Changing mood, Brenda grins, digging 
him
           in the ribs.

                                     BRENDA
                       Before you start saving lives
                       in Honduras and lovers in Paris,
                       will you do something for me?
        
           He blinks, focusing on her. His eyes are still magic. She 
loves him
           to death.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Yes. What would you like?

                                     BRENDA
                       Will you take me to Scotland?
                       I want to see where you were born.

           MacLeod is pleased. After all the years he's lived, the miles 
he's
           travelled, the thought of returning to the place where it all 
started
           moves him.

                                     MACLEOD
                              (embracing her)
                       Are you sure this is what you want?

                                     BRENDA
                       I'm sure.

           He strokes her face.

                                     MACLEOD
                       Will you call me Conner MacLeod?
                       It's my real name. I long to
                       hear it again.

           She tries not to cry. He holds her tight, looking into
           her eyes. He knows what she's thinking.

                                     MACLEOD
                               
                       Ramirez was wrong. Just one year
                       of love is better than an eternity
                       alone.

           Composure regained, she grins.

                                     BRENDA
                       Right. Now it's time for the
                       ceremony.

                                     MACLEOD
                       What ceremony?

           She fills the glasses, handing him one.

                                     MACLEOD

                       It was all I could find. Listen,
                       1976 was a very good year.
                              (reciting)
                       America celebrated its 200th year
                       of independence from England. One
                       Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest won
                       five Academy Awards. And
                       Pittsburgh beat Dallas in the
                       Super Bowl.

           He cracks up, kissing her eyes, mouth, hair. She
           pushes him away.

                       to make a toast.

           He smiles, remembering the night at her apartment.

            They raise their glasses. She forgets her lines.

                       Hold it a second. I'm trying
                       to remember.

           Next second, she's ready. He wonders what's coming.
           She looks at him lovingly.

           He blinks.

           They clink glasses.

           Moved, he drinks. Putting down her glass, she flings
           her arms around his neck, kissing him. He responds
           passionately.

           The liner moves away.
