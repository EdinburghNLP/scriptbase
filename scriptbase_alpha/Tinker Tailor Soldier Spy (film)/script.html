<b>                      TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY
</b>


                            Written by

                Bridget O'Connor &amp; Peter Straughan




<b>1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1
</b>
    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.
    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we
    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in
    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,
    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG
    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.


<b>2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2
</b>
    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets
    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man
    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.

    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who
    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The
    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?

    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.
    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into
    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't
    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks
    over, shakes hands.

    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked
    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.

    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the
    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the
    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and
    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness
    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of
    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the
    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...


<b>3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3
</b>
    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA
    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk
    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and
    head towards...


<b>4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4
</b>
    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,
    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE
    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A
    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused
    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the
    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking
    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The
    ordinary world.
<b>                                                               2.
</b>


We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the
tables.

<b>                    MAGYAR
</b>              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          And porkolts. You know porkolts?

<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX
</b>              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          Yes, I've had it.

<b>                    MAGYAR
</b>          It's very good. Better than
          goulash. But you won't get it in
          Budapest now.

<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX
</b>          Why's that?

<b>                    MAGYAR
</b>          All the pigs have gone to Moscow.

He gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his
cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables
around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his
grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two
wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the
Waiter's face, drips onto the table top.

The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a
wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has
begun to ring inside him.

<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX
</b>          When do I get to meet your
          friend?

The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is
ignoring his.

<b>                    MAGYAR
</b>          I'll take you to him. Not eating?

Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner
still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands
at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another
man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -
checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his
gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which
look down into the arcade.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a
window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she
shrinks back into the darkness and disappears.
<b>                                                                3.
</b>


Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee
cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in
surprise.

<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX
</b>          Would you excuse me a moment?

He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind
him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back
and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to
the domed ceiling.

The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic
flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of
his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing
in the cavernous space.

The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and
Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,
as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal
NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,
like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some
drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in
Russian.

<b>                       KGB MAN
</b>          No firing!

Ahead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.
He looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -
this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending
him flying out of   frame.

From around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -
strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.

<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Who told you to fire? Who told
          you to fucking fire?

THE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the
ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.

In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.

HER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.
As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of
blood. Then he's still.

BELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to
beat him.

<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We
          wanted him alive!
<b>                                                                       4.
</b>


     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's
     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the
     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.

     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured
     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He
     lights a cigarette.

     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an
     inscription: "To George, from Ann. All my love."

     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the
     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.

<b>                                               FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>                                                       FADE IN:
</b>

<b>4A   EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - "THE CIRCUS" - DAY         4A
</b>
     A bird's eye view of the Circus.


<b>4B   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - "MOTHERS" OFFICE - DAY       4B
</b>
     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans
     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the
     secretaries or "MOTHERS" walks past, pushing a trolley of
     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks
     stricken. The Mother walks on into...


<b>5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5
</b>
     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN
     at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate
     carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill.
     He is signing documents, his signature a simple "C,"
     scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A
     cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.

     This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.

     Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the
     intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY
     BLAND and BILL HAYDON.

     Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.

     From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we
     are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All
     we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of
     the pen.

     Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him.
     Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.
<b>                                                                      5.
</b>


    CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the
    SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.

    - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension,
    pulls on his cigarette.

     - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty
    look up at Smiley and away.

     - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on
    Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.

    No-one will look at him.

    ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.

    Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands
    the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of
    the room.

<b>                        PERCY ALLELINE
</b>                  (Scottish accent)
              I wish I could have done more,
              Control.

<b>                        CONTROL
</b>                  (Coolly)
              You did all you could, Percy.
              (Beat) Well, a man should know
              when to leave the party.

    Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it
    sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's
    face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little
    note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.

    Toby can't wait any longer.

<b>                        TOBY ESTERHASE
</b>              What about Smiley?

    Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...

    ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to
    prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.

<b>                        CONTROL
</b>              Smiley is leaving with me.


<b>6   OMITTED                                                       6
</b>

<b>7   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                               7
</b>
    PUSHING Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor.
<b>                                                                       6.
</b>


     Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A
     horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift
     doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks
     at him with contempt.

<b>                         BILL HAYDON
</b>               You little prick Esterhase.

     Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk
     every step of the way. Smiley follows.

     Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid
     hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that
     each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the
     fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence,
     staffed by RESEARCHERS.

     Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the
     third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of
     offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.

     Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the
     Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa
     and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in
     respectful silence.

     On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty
     young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as
     their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally
     down to...

     An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be
     marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the
     main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with
     a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...

     CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each
     other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands.
     Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a
     lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see
     that he is pained by this.

     Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands
     forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.

     THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.

     A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through
     his retirement.

     He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a
     straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through
     the water.

     Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the
     cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little
     less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY
     SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than
     trembling bones.

     Is this his world now?

     A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and
     places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS
     TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her
     through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind
     her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in
     Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and
     whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.

     She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files
     into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.

     Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of

     to focus on it.

      Lights glowing in the early morning gloom, an ultra-modern

      As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the
      living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As
      we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN
      steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through
      the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks
      up, surprised.

      As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand
      behind his back.

      And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.

      Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON,
      tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the

     PULLING OLIVER LACON as he leads Smiley and Guillam down
     the hall, gesturing for his WIFE to take Jackie away. He
     attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained.

<b>                         LACON
</b>               And how are you George? Missing
               one's work, one's buddies?

<b>                          SMILEY
</b>               Oh, I think I manage pretty well,
               thank you.

     They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano
     framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man -
     FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens
     the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the
     terrace beyond.

     Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the
     room and slips behind the sofa.

<b>                         LACON
</b>               Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in
               the pink, and so on.

<b>                         SMILEY
</b>               Very well. (Beat) Very bonny...

     Fawn closes the french doors behind him and Lacon is suddenly
     all business.

<b>                         LACON
</b>               Do you know this man Tarr?

<b>                         SMILEY
</b>                   (Mildly)
               I recruited him actually. In
               Penang. Good with women. Likes to
               talk. What did he say to you?

<b>                         LACON
</b>               He said he had some intelligence
               for Control. Had no idea he was
               dead. The news obviously hadn't
               reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he
               said he would only tell it to
               someone outside the Circus. If he
               couldn't have a Minister, he would
               settle for the Under-secretary.
               Lucky me.

     Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to
     something. Smiley waits him out. The room has become very
     still.

<b>                         LACON (CONT'D)
</b>               He said there's a mole. Right at
               the top of the Circus. And that
               he's been there for years.

     Smiley absorbs this. The moment is suddenly broken by a few
     stray notes from the piano. The two jump slightly and turn to
     where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.

     Smiley and Lacon stand on the terrace alone. Lacon glances
     anxiously at Smiley, trying to read him.

<b>                         LACON
</b>               I was sad to see you go, George. I
               thought it was shabby, very shabby.

</b>
<b>                    LACON (CONT'D)
</b>          But the Minister agreed with Sir
          Percy. New broom, clean sweep,
          wheat from the chaff and all that.
          And to be fair, Percy has had some
          marvellous results since you and
          Control left...

Realizing how this sounds, he glances at Smiley to see how
much damage he's caused.

<b>                    LACON (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, it does mean you're rather
          ideally placed to look into this
          matter for us now, doesn't it?
          Outside the family?

Smiley looks blandly back at him.

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          I am retired, Oliver.

Silence. Lacon looks uncomfortable, something he hasn't yet
said.

<b>                    LACON
</b>          Thing is, some time back, when
          Control was still alive, he came to
          me with a similar suggestion.

Smiley looks at him, surprised.

<b>                    LACON (CONT'D)
</b>          He never mentioned his suspicions
          to you?

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          No.

<b>                    LACON
</b>          I just thought... with you being
          "his man", so to speak.

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          What did you say to him?

<b>                     LACON
</b>              (Beat)
          I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
          had got the better of him and he
          was pulling his own house down.
          That does happen in your business.
          And that bloody mess in Budapest...

Smiley stares out over the rolling countryside, inscrutable.

<b>                    LACON (CONT'D)

     He controls himself.

               I'll keep Peter Guillam. And
               there's a retired special branch
               man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.

     Lacon exhales, his relief palpable.

<b>                         LACON
</b>               Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping.
               Good man.

     He glances back at Guillam and Lacon's daughter, picking out
     a melody on the grand piano.

<b>                         LACON (CONT'D)

     GLOVED HANDS loading a COLONY OF BEES into a new HIVE.

     An APIARIST, in protective hat and gloves, turns to examine
     the MAN who has appeared in his back yard - GEORGE SMILEY.
     Smiley raises a hand.

     The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat
     to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes - INSPECTOR MENDEL.

     Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered
     briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to
     Smiley and Guillam in the front. He begins to roll a
     cigarette as Guillam drives away.
<b>                                                                       18.

     A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz
     around the car. Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily.
     Smiley stares ahead in silence. He winds down the window
     and the bee flies to safety.

     A large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single
     beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS.

     Smiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a
     gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the
     room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it
     from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes
     the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex.

<b>                         MRS POPE GRAHAM

               It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend
               it to you but since Mister Mendel
               recommends you...

     She gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a
     little to drown out the excesses from the room next door.

<b>                         MRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D)

     into the London street.

<b>LATER:
</b>
Smiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the
stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off
the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his
bag.

<b>                     SMILEY
</b>          Control lived with his sister
          didn't he?

He straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet.

Mendel flips his notebook back. He's already there.

     The rest of the room is mounded with PILES AND PILES OF
     PAPERS - files, document boxes, maps and charts, something
     insane in the sprawl of it all.

     Guillam stands with his back to us staring at a CHESS SET
     laid out before the chair, as if in mid-game. Four of the
     chess pieces have had PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES added to them -
<b>     ROY BLAND. TOBY ESTERHASE. PERCY ALLELINE. BILL HAYDON -
</b>     all wearing paper PARTY HATS. The effect is ridiculous and
     a little disturbing, like some Surrealist objet d'art.

     Guillam hears Smiley and turns, almost guiltily, and as he
     moves we see there is a FIFTH PHOTOGRAPH on a piece - and
     it is of Smiley himself.

     Smiley stares at his image.

     Toby Esterhase is on the telephone, speaking softly in

     Haydon in the doorway, cup of tea in hand. Esterhase asks the

     Alleline stands on the rooftop, staring out over the London
     skyline, his expression ambiguous - perhaps obscurely
     troubled to have found himself at the top. He becomes aware
     of Roy Bland standing behind him.

     Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows
     himself a small smile of triumph - and relief.

<b>                         ALLELINE
</b>               Of course they do. We have

     The far wall is now stacked to the ceiling with the
     contents of Control's room - thousands of files and

     The "Scalphunters" floor. Guillam is in his office, painted
     out panels below the waist, glass above. He sits, hands on
     the desk, steeling himself for what he has to do.

     Abruptly he stands and walks out.

     We TRACK with him as he walks through the Scalphunters
     "quad" area - a worn out sofa, the old pool table.

     One of the Scalphunters - KASPAR - stands flirting with a
     pretty SECRETARY - BELINDA - the "Deb" we saw earlier.
     Guillam acknowledges them casually as he passes. The girl

     Kaspar stares after Guillam. He doesn't.

     We continue tracking with Guillam as he leaves the
     Scalphunters area, walks down the corridor, turns left
     into...

     He stands at the basins, checking the room is clear.
     Examines his watch, then crosses to the door and opens it a
     crack, peering out.

<b>     GUILLAM'S P.O.V.
</b>
     We're looking though a glass panelled door at the PERSONNEL
     OFFICE. A dapper little man in a club tie - FAWLEY - sits
     behind his desk, idly tapping a desk toy - a Newton's
     Cradle. He too checks his watch. Lunch time. Gets up and
     walks out of his office.

     Guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly,
     walks out of the men's room, across the corridor and
     into...

     The Cradle is still swinging - steel balls clacking softly.
     Guillam is opening a safe, pulling out documents,
     photographing them with a SUBMINIATURE CAMERA.

     Close on the documents as Guillam silently photographs
     them.

     Guillam hears a voice outside. He draws a SMALL KNIFE from
     his pocket.

     Kaspar opens the door and walks in, finding... the office
     empty.

     Then a faint noise. He works his way around the desk, finds
     Guillam crouched down, his back to him.

     a cut.

     Guillam has just stepped into the lift. Roy Bland appears
     suddenly and steps in beside him.

     Silence for a moment as they descend...

</b>          If it was up to me, I'd replace
          them all with those `naice' girls

He reaches suddenly for Guillam's coat, lying on the seat -
his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE

He pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can
fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment.

          "Who's that old fucker?"

He stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are
cold and watchful.

      Guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After
      a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so
      older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and
      joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the
      window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone
      see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back
      at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The
      two sit in domestic contentment, reading.

      A ministerial car pulls up and Lacon climbs out.

</b>
      The music - a CHARLIE RICH track - plays on a TRANSISTOR
      RADIO. Smiley sits at the window listening to the MUSIC.

      Guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took
      at the circus.

      Smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him. He
      turns away, tunes the radio into a DIFFERENT STATION,
      cutting the Charlie Rich tune.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM
</b>                Jerry Westerby, dismissed
                December 4th. And... Connie
                Sachs, retired November 28th.
                That's just two weeks after you
                and Control were forced out.

      Smiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET. He
      writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a
      chess piece.

      There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the
      room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM. Lacon's
      wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost
      offended at the role he finds himself playing.

          anything to report?

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          Not much, I'm afraid. We were
          just discussing the departure of
          Connie Sachs. I wonder how
          Research manages without her.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          Probably relieved. She always
          struck me as unhinged.

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          That was one of her talents.

LACON looks around him, dripping disdain.

</b>                 (Distracted)
          Hmm?

He turns to him.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps
          that's what we have to become? A
          little paranoid?

He turns back to the chess board.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>              (To Lacon)
          Your "clean sweep."

          behind that sweep? What if each
          of us, whether we knew it or not,
          represented a threat to the Mole?

Lacon looks at a pile of files, distractedly picks one up.
He starts to leaf through one...

<b>                    LACON
</b>              (Unconvinced)

      He looks to Guillam for the name.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM
</b>                Jim Prideaux.

      Smiley nods thoughtfully.

<b>                          SMILEY
</b>                Yes. Yes, he did.

      He writes PRIDEAUX on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess
      piece. Lacon picks up another file, Something catches his
      eye: a letter head of FLAMES. He looks up shocked.

<b>                          LACON
</b>                How did you get this? This is
                Witchcraft material.

      He grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket.

      Smiley looks at him. Lacon reads something implacable in
      Smiley's gaze...

      Smiley turns back to the chess set.

<b>                          SMILEY
</b>                Control was out. And Alleline was

      He climbs into the waiting car. We catch a glimpse of the
      MINISTER in the back.

<b>                          SMILEY (V.O.)

      A third-rate English preparatory school. The string
      orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing
      away at their instruments. A teacher winces as he hacks at
      the air above their heads with a ruler.

     Near the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump,
     asthmatic, the last to be chosen for everything. He looks
     out of the window.

     Roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the
     window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a
     battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the
     window - driving past.

     Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness
     of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.


<b>66   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             66
</b>
     We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue
     Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and
     rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring
     his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and
     menace. There's something odd about the way he moves,
     something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of
     true...

     The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading
     bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.

     He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him.
     Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded
     figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.

     In his palm, a MARBLE.

<b>     LATER:
</b>
     Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it
     rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an
     improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the
     centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.

     Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the
     Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...

     The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard,
     perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some
     pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one
     side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch
     a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to
     spread. It's BLOOD.

     A large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint
     sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden.

     Smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over-
     grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked
<b>     "SACHS."

     Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a
     young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware
     of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking
     round the house.

     A group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version
     of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming
     to the song `Don't' by Doris.

     An older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a
     prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at
     the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks
     into a charming smile.

     Connie is working late. She sits in front of a Steenbeck
     flatbed editing table, she's chain-smoking, unkempt, but
     completely focused on the moving images on the screen.

<b>                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.)
</b>          ... the busiest culture vulture
          that Embassy ever had.

On the walls around her are framed STILLS from the footage
she is watching: Russian Officials at ceremonies - each
picture gridded, each official labelled as Connie manages to
identify them.

<b>                    CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
</b>          For years we'd been hearing rumours
          that Karla was building a private
          army of his own, outside Moscow
          Centre. We knew he had agents
          scattered round the globe. I
          started spending time with the
          Moscow gazers combing Soviet
          bulletins and any material I could
          get.

ON SCREEN - Ancient SOVIET VETERANS stand in rows displaying
the medals on their chests.

<b>                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Late one night in Research, I was
          trawling through some footage of
          May Day in Berlin, 1969. I saw
          something, George.

Connie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS in
suits are walking into their designated places. We see
POLYAKOV amongst them.

One of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest
full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Just
before he is obscured by another official we see what the old
veteran does.

He salutes Polyakov.

Connie's smile of triumph is reflected on the screen. She
lights a cigarette.

<b>                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I saw it, George.

Connie rewinds the tape and we see the salute - backwards.
And again - forwards.

<b>                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Why would a distinguished soldier,
          four medals for gallantry, salute
          our cultural attache Polly? Unless
          Polly was a war veteran himself?
          And if he was, why hide the fact?

at the centre of her obsession.

</b>                I went straight to Esterhase and
                Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a
                Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw
                one. And if he's here it's because
                he's running a mole."

head and saunters out.

     Mendel holds two mugs of tea in one hand, gives the agreed
     knock at Smiley's door again. After a moment a bleary
     Smiley opens the door and lets him in.

</b>
     Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his
     odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One -
     SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others.


<b>85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85
</b>
     A fire burns in the little grate.

     ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps
     the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but
     doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again.

     Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy -
<b>     SPIKELY.
</b>
<b>                         PRIDEAUX
</b>               Hand those out.

     He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE
<b>     M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL...
</b>
     Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk
     like a HUNCHBACK.

     The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn,
     continues writing.

     Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound.
     A little soot falls...

     The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the
     fire... what is that noise?

     Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the
     grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the
     class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed
     straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird
     swoops towards his face.

     Then...

     ... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird
     from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself,
     NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it.

     The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE.

     Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where
     Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised
     shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.

               Come down here.

     Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him.
     Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a
     little.

     He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further.
     Prideaux pretends not to notice.

<b>                         PRIDEAUX
</b>               Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone
               ever call you that?

     The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down,
     busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.

</b>               Free period, isn't it? Don't
               waste it down here.

     Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux
     has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to
     him, rubbing his aching shoulder.

</b>
     Smiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining
     the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something
     more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something
     up. A WEDGE.

     Smiley walks into the hallway senses alert. He pads towards
     the drawing room, wipes sweat from his hands on his
     trousers, steels himself. Is it finally Them, come for him?
     He walks in and finds...

rubs his beard.

          You going to find him then? The

Smiley crosses to another chair. As he does so he's
scanning the room - automatically noting the changes - the
remains of a meal on a table...

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          I'm going to try. How long have

they've been disturbed.

      Ricki Tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine.
      Groomed, smart, that same restless energy. A car pulls up
      across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British
      spy, not over-bright, signals to him. Tarr pulls his shades
      down and saunters over to his ride.

                spending high and wide in the
                nightclubs and some idiot thought
                we could turn him.

      Tarr opens the back seat and gets in. Tufty's slightly
      foolish smile slips a little.

      Nineteenth century European grandeur. But the apartment
      we're in is deserted and in a state of disrepair. Tarr
      stands at tripod mounted BINOCULARS set back from the
      window, idly playing with a knife with a distinctive white
      BONE handle.

     TARR'S P.O.V. - the HOTEL opposite - a Brutalist concrete
     slab, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. In the
     bedroom a heavy set man - BORIS - is having sex with a

</b>
<b>                         RICKI TARR (V.O.)
</b>               I took one look and saw that he
               was a hood, Moscow trained.

     We TRACK to one side, and see the "drawing room" of the
     hotel suite, where Boris' two MINDERS, SERGEI and IVAN,
     wait, smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom.

<b>                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               Probably coat trailing, trying to
               draw one of our men out into the
               open.

     We TRACK further along again and see the CORRIDOR outside
     the hotel room, where a YOUNG WOMAN has just arrived. This
     is IRINA.

<b>                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               He had a wife with him. Common-
               law.

     Irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room, where
     the Minders stare fixedly at the floor, trying not to
     laugh. She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid
     jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris
     lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.

     Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a
     BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and
     we lose her as she bends over a basin.

     Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he
     leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.

     Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted
     glass and stares straight at us...

     RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he
     should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look.

     A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the
     road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head
     - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible
     BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else,
     anger at her humiliation being observed.

      As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase
      and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his
      cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he
      draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring
      our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is
      thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along
      the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the
      billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the
      curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.

      Alleline sits in his baronial chair, alone in the room. He
      looks what he is. A man who knows he's OUT OF HIS DEPTH.

      Across from him the SAFE stands, an almost malignant
      presence.

      Alleline stares at it, a light film of sweat on his
      forehead.

      somewhere under-ground.

      Alleline walks along the courts, new racquet in hand,
      uncomfortable in his too- tight white shorts. He reaches a
      court. Inside LACON and the MINISTER are playing a furious
      game of squash.


<b>127   INT. SQUASH CLUB - EVENING                                  127

      The three men stand talking within the transparent cube of
      the court. Lacon and the Minister are still sweating from
      their game. The Minister is smoking.

<b>                          OLIVER LACON
</b>                Percy has always resisted
                suggestions of wider exploitation
                of Witchcraft's intelligence.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>                Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

<b>                          PERCY ALLELINE
</b>                I've refused to share Witchcraft
                with our allies, so far,
                Minister.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>                Greedy boy.

<b>                          PERCY ALLELINE
</b>                My goal has been to establish his
                track record beyond all doubt. I
                think the time has come to
                approach our American brothers-in-
                arms.

      The Minister considers this with some excitement, takes a
      drag on his cigarette.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>                You think they'll take us back
                into bed?

<b>                          PERCY ALLELINE
</b>                I'm not interested in a one-off
                trade. I want on-going access to
                American intelligence.

      This stops the Minister. He turns to face Alleline.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>                Do you think we can get it?

      Alleline senses he has just risen several rungs. He slashes
      inexpertly with his racquet.
<b>                                                                       57.

      Smiley swims in the placid water. We hear music. The tinkle
      of glasses from a happy Christmas party...

</b>                Percy. Did you do this?

      A Christmas Party of the past. Control, at the height of
      his powers, a punch glass in hand. Noise and music: the
      normally earnest atmosphere of the Circus released in an
      unexpectedly boisterous gathering.

<b>                          CONTROL (CONT'D)
</b>                You penny pinching Scot. Can you
                not take a bloody order. No one
                is to tamper with the recipe.
                It's going to take us five hours
                to get drunk on this piss water.

      Alleline tries to smile.

<b>                          PERCY ALLELINE
</b>                I followed the recipe.

      He glances nervously at his wife, a vivacious alcoholic,
      just beginning to make a show of herself. She puts a CROWN-
      SHAPED party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head. He
      brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool.

      BILL HAYDON, wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish
      angle, appears in the nick of time, leads Alleline's wife out
      for a dance, teasing the sullenness from her. They're good
      dancers. Alleline relieved, crisis averted.

       We find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly
       drunk deb. Control raises his arm above the melee. He's
       still at the punch bowl.

<b>                           CONTROL
</b>                 Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a

                      from the deb)
                 I'll go find her.

       Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst
       his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and
       Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The
       Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them
       for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues
       into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily,
       many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing
       with vigour.

       Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by
       the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier.

       His P.O.V. -

       - One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter,
       pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly
       outweighed, but competitive to the finish.

        - ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty
       debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand
       and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn
       with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling...

       He stops seeing something in the shadows of an office. For
       a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen.

       Two shapes locked in an embrace.

      Guillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a
      moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over.
      It's Mendel.

      arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs
      up the four steps.

      Guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. The
      security guard, Bryant, steps from his box. Beyond him is
      the row of lifts.

<b>                          BRYANT

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry

<b>                    BRYANT
</b>          Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag
          sir.

Bryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling
open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag.

Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly
slowly. As Bryant's head disappears...

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          Time you oiled this thing, isn't
          it?

<b>                    BRYANT (O.S.)
</b>          We keep asking...

Guillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the
first time we realize how NERVOUS he is.

Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the
uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.

Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and
yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he
stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          You're kidding?

<b>                       JANITOR PETE
</b>          New rules.

Guillam is briskly frisked.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          Mind the jewels.

<b>                    JANITOR PETE
</b>          Pen and watch sir.

He holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen
and watch.

The search over Guillam sets off down the corridor,
unnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind.

<b>                    BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
</b>          What the hell are you doing up
          here?

Guillam freezes. Then he turns. It's Bill Haydon standing
in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. A
moment.

</b>                Why would I be? You bloody

      Then Bill grins, the grin transforming his face. Guillam
      smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM
</b>                As the grave. When're you going
                to give us something to do?

<b>                          BILL HAYDON
</b>                Haven't you heard? Technology's
                the future. No need for you apes
                anymore. I can get you a posting
                to Northern Ireland if that helps
                get the blood racing.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM
</b>                Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting
                on my arse.

      They've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels away,
      a hand raised in farewell.

      Guillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to
      the vast archive of files beyond. A Janitor appears in the

      filling out requisition slips. Behind the desk, a woman -

      The LIFT CAGE we saw earlier is being raised from the floor

      Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files

      We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the
      fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his
      green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam
      looks across at his real objective...

      A row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the
      archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year
      and month they cover.

      And in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending
      a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at
      Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment
      Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his
      shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another
      WORKMAN behind him.

      Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it,
      keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his
      desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead.

      He sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting...
      From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a PHONE RINGING,
      then being answered. Moments later...

      Mendel is using the office phone, an ELDERLY GERMAN
      MECHANIC, stands outside guarding the office door. In the
      background a POP TUNE is playing on the radio.

      One of the Mothers is listening routinely in on the call,
      TAPE SPOOLS revolving, recording the conversation. The POP
      TUNE plays, insidiously working its way into her head. She
      idly taps her pen along to the tune.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)

      Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him.

</b>                Thanks.

      Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the
      phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it
      with the one against his chest. He takes an address book
      from the bag and finds a number.

      into...

      Guillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the
      pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its
      original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the
      bracket. It's done.

      Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs
      it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns.

      Alleline sits in the baronial chair, Bland at his left.
      Haydon on his right. Esterhase trots over to his seat.
      Guillam takes in the REPORT they all seem to have spread
      out in front of them.

      Guillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall.

</b>                Couple of Arab ploys look quite

</b>                I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

A moment, while the room digests this. A relaxation of the
tension, as if he's passed some kind of test.

<b>                    PERCY ALLELINE
</b>          So if I told you that Tarr had

          account last month, would that

This DOES shock Guillam, but he manages to hold on to his
sullen expression.

      Guillam is walking to the lifts, we note he is now carrying
      his BAG. Behind him ROY BLAND is walking down the corridor.
      He peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself - the
      same POP SONG that was playing at the garage in the
      background of Guillam's call. Guillam reacts as he keeps on
      walking, trying to work out if this MEANS SOMETHING. We
      track with him as his anger and PARANOIA grow.

      halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past
      them and on into the car body repair shop. He gets and
      strides past the elderly GERMAN MECHANIC we saw earlier.

      Guillam strides on, nerves at snapping point, to the other
      end of the workshop where a Vauxhall waits.

      Behind him the Mechanic and his SON are already beginning
      to strip the plates off Guillam's car.

Guillam hurries into the room, stops, seeing Tarr. Tarr
gives his sunny grin but he's sweating, his eyes full of
tension.

<b>                    TARR
</b>          Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I
          took so long to come back.

Guillam punches him in the face, drags him from the chair,
the two struggling.

Behind them Smiley and Fawn appear. Smiley watches coolly
for a moment then signals Fawn, who drags Guillam off Tarr,
expertly pinning his arm.

<b>                    FAWN
</b>          Excuse me, sir.

Guillam pulls free angrily.

<b>                    SMILEY

          of lies thought up by Moscow.
          Karla's bought him for thirty

He pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file.

pages.

Tarr hesitates, considering.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM

          November 20th. Evening.

Smiley has found the right month. He flicks through the
dated pages - 18th November, 19th November...

He holds up the book - the next page has been cut out.

<b>                    SMILEY

          Someone is covering their tracks

          just a coincidence?

Guillam looks thrown.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>          What about the money?

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          Thirty thousand isn't so much for

          Circus knows all about Mister
          Tarr and is doing everything they
          can to discredit him.

Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down
the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some
writing on the next page.

<b>                    PETER GUILLAM
</b>              (Reading)

      The two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch.
      Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and
      the lack of sleep.

      Guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the
      PHOTOGRAPHS of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his
      chessmen.

      Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is
      affecting him.

          in pieces. Purge after purge.
          Half their Agents were jumping
          ship and I travelled around
          signing them up. Hundreds of
          them.

Guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          One of them was calling himself
          Gerstmann. He was on his way back
          to Russia, and we were pretty
          sure he was going to be executed.
          Plane had a twenty-four lay over
          at Delhi, and that's how long I
          had to convince him to come over
          to us instead of going home to
          die.

Smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of
the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Little room...I'm sitting

He points to an EMPTY CHAIR in front of him.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          The Americans have had him
          tortured.

He holds up his right hand.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          No fingernails. It's incredibly
          hot. I'm very tired and all I
          want to do is get this over with

          going well with Ann.

Guillam flinches a little, but Smiley doesn't notice, lost
now in the past.

<b>                     SMILEY (CONT'D)

          your plane and fly home and be
          shot, like Bykov, Shur,

He stares at the CHAIR as if expecting an answer, and
slightly drunkenly Guillam finds himself turning to the
CHAIR for a response.

Smiley doesn't answer - STARES AT THE CHAIR - the silence
stretching - it's all becoming a little surreal.

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>              (To the chair)
          Think of your wife. You have a

          some cigarettes, by the way.

He mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between
him and the chair.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Use my lighter.

He mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes.

He makes a vague "Etcetera" gesture, stares at...

acquiring the GHOSTLY PRESENCE OF KARLA.

                Next morning he got back on his
                plane, gave the pack of
                cigarettes back to me, untouched -
                this was a chain-smoker, mind -
                and flew off to what he presumed
                would be his death. He kept my
                lighter. It was a gift - "To
                George, from Ann. All my love."

      Guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe-struck.

<b>                          PETER GUILLAM

                fanatic. And the fanatic is
                always concealing a secret doubt.

      He stands up, crosses to the window, embarrassed by what he
      has to say next.

      KASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching
      him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something
      of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters
      gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly
      enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull
      Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight
      escalating as others join in the struggle.

<b>                          KASPAR

      taking charge. Kicks the door shut.

      Westerby watches Haydon on the phone from the door. Haydon
      listens to a voice for a moment, then hangs up. He stands,
      his back to Westerby.

<b>                          JERRY WESTERBY

      For a moment it looks like Haydon won't answer but then he
      seems to master his emotions.

      Haydon walks around the neat rooms. A bike up on the wall,
      a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to
      be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and
      books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap
      from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF.

       reaches into frame and picks it up.

       A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls
       alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other,
       chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to
       move.

       An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger
       in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of
       passenger outrage.

       We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.

       We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street,
       driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.

       Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very
       still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the
       surface, dips in, breaks the surface...

       Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off
       from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD
       appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An
       old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings
       to the edge of the platform for a moment.

      He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the
      trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley,
      watched and alone.

      Smiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on
      the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at
      the mail.

      The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch
      a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a
      passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they
      disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love-
      making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH
      track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel.

      Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to
      look up.

      He pushes open the door and moves into...

      ... which is EMPTY. He sits in an armchair, starts opening
      some letters.

      A FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look
      up.

<b>                          BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
</b>                Good flight?

      Smiley looks up.

      BILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and
      trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense
      of having been caught in an act of adultery.

                  insisted on getting up. She said
                  she'll be down in a minute.

       Smiley glances at a half-wrapped oil painting lying against
       a chair.

       Smiley stands in front of the muddy-looking abstract

       We hold on Smiley but hear Haydon leave the room, a
       WHISPERED CONFERENCE in the hall between Haydon and Ann.

       P.O.V. - FROM THE DOOR - George with his back to us, staring
       fixedly at the picture, listening to the whispers behind his

      Roach wipes his eyes and leaves. As soon as the door is
      closed Prideaux crawls under the little chest of drawers,
      grimacing with pain, working an arm further in...

      There is a FAINT SOUND - SOMEONE ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE.

      With a final effort Prideaux rips his RIFLE free from its
      hiding place, still trailing tape, and rolls to face the

      A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Prideaux aims the gun...

      obsession. The FIVE PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES fixed to the CHESS

<b>                          SMILEY

                I thought it was madness. To
                think any one of you could have
                been a traitor... madness.

      Smiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding
      something.

<b>                          SMILEY
</b>                But still you went? Risking your
                life for a mission you thought
                was absurd? Why?

      Prideaux doesn't answer.

<b>                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>                Perhaps some part of you wanted to
                know if Control was right? Wanted
                to know if there was a Mole, who it
                might be?

      Prideaux shoots him a dangerous look.

                   go. It's called doing one's duty.

      Prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform
      towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian
      newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the
      other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all
      apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing -
      BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the
      man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES.

      Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg.

</b>
      The scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts
      down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead
      hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile
      for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor
      around him...

      HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the
      BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's
      wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the
      surveillance agents don't have time to change.

      Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees
      the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO:

      The SHOT -

      ... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as
      we CUT TO:


<b>      PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V.
</b>
      Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the
      floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as
      the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background
      comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is
      crying, an ambulance siren is wailing.

      Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted
      up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of
      the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by
      the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting
      ambulance.

      We are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp
      with sweat, shoulders trembling.

      We PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering
      the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy,
      heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker
      in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze
      down...

      Prideaux, in too much pain to walk, is being dragged down a
      brightly lit corridor towards an INTERROGATION ROOM at the

      He is taken inside, the door closed behind him.

      Smiley stands staring at the OWL Prideaux killed, which is
      now stuffed, keeping guard from the top of a bookshelf.
      Prideaux sits at a desk drinking the vodka.

Prideaux nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to
rise, but doesn't move. His expression hasn't changed, but
inside him something has just been decided.

<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
</b>          What was your last line of

<b>                    PRIDEAUX
</b>          The Mole. Control's crazy theory.
          I was going to bury that so deep,

          Which was a joke.

<b>                       SMILEY

<b>                    PRIDEAUX
</b>          Because they already knew. They
          wanted to know how far Control
          had got in his investigation.

<b>                       SMILEY
</b>          What else?

<b>                    PRIDEAUX

          of thing.

</b>          Did they ask about me at all?

<b>                    PRIDEAUX

Smiley becomes very still.

<b>                    SMILEY
</b>          What did he say about me?

<b>                    PRIDEAUX
</b>          He had a cigarette lighter. Kept

          Showed me the inscription.
          "To George, from Ann. All my
          love." He reckoned after Bill's
          fling with her, she might want to
          change the inscription.

      A concrete bunker of a room. Prideaux is standing in a slab
      of watery sunshine that falls from a sky-light above. He's
      smoking, trying to control the tremble in his hand.

      PRIDEAUX P.O.V. - The patch of sunshine only extends a few
      yards in front of him. The rest of the room is in granite
      shadow. The sense of other people watching from the
      shadows. The sound of a door opening and someone being led
      in.

      A woman walks across the dark room and into the slab of
      light, blinking as she does so.

      It's IRINA.

      Her hair is loose and dishevelled about her face. A man's
      voice comes from further back in the darkness...

      Prideaux looks at her. Frowns. Another voice murmurs in
      Russian. Irina pins her hair up in the way we saw before.

<b>                          PRIDEAUX
</b>                I don't know her.

      She looks at Prideaux and gives a small polite smile, as
      though good manners are going to save her.

<b>                          IRINA

      A GUARD steps out of the shadows and SHOOTS her in the
      head, the shot THUNDEROUS in the room. It's horribly
      unexpected, and Prideaux jerks backward, bewildered and
      appalled.

      spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD,
      watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we

          steals our secrets he does it
          under the very nose of the
          Circus, in the house which you
          persuaded the treasury to pay
          for. I'm sure you'll be able to
          take full credit for that.

          chicken-feed. Control didn't
          believe in miracles and he didn't
          believe in Witchcraft. But you
          were lazy and you were greedy and
          so you hounded him out of the
          Circus and you let Karla in.

His voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different
now. There's a quiet fury in him. The Minister is ashen.

                him sideways, some department
                where he can't do any harm? Is

                It was to lure the Americans.
                Now, do you want to take credit

      Lacon and the Minister stare at Smiley.

<b>                    BILL HAYDON
</b>          Oh, that was nothing personal,
          George, I hope you understand that?
          Karla said you were good, the one
          we had to worry about. But you do
          have a blind spot.

<b>                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
</b>                He reckoned if I was known to be
                Ann's lover you wouldn't be able
                to see me straight. And he was
                right, up to a point.

</b>                Up to a point.


<b>246   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   246
</b>
      The flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions.
      Smiley looks around, places a CHESS PIECE on the piano. We
      see the piece bears the name HAYDON.

<b>                          SMILEY
</b>                    (Quietly)
                "Tailor."

      He walks away.


<b>247   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   247
</b>
      George comes up his path, looking old and tired.


<b>248   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   248
</b>
      He stops still inside his doorway. The little figure on the
      console table is in the wrong position. Smiley puts his
      hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something
      from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.

      Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a
      WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.

      Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat,
      staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a
      Vermeer in the image.

      He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding
      whether to go in. Or not.

      Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco
      version of LA MER - very seventies.

<b>249   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT - PAST              249
</b>
      The same lively Christmas PARTY at the Circus we saw
      earlier. BILL HAYDON, a little drunk and happy, works his
      way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias'
      track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek,
      singing along.

<b>      HAYDON'S P.O.V.
</b>
      ... other members of the Circus glimpsed as we pass them -
      CONNIE SACHS, WESTERBY, BLAND, drunk, grinning at us. TOBY
      ESTERHASE talking to one of the SECRETARIES...

      The MUSIC continues as we find...

      CONTROL and SMILEY

      ...sitting a little apart, talking. Haydon is still working
      his way through the party...

      We PASS PERCY ALLELINE and his DRUNK WIFE. Alleline looking
      fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is
      making...

      Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone,
      but heads on to his destination...

      PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him,
      shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot
      Haydon is prepared to make of himself...

<b>254   EXT. SARRATT - EVENING - PRESENT                         254
</b>
      The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the
      circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the
      dark.

      Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by.
      He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something,
      turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind
      him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each
      other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.

      We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only
      sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.

      Finally...

<b>                             BILL HAYDON
</b>                       (Of the runners)

</b>


        A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same
        execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force
        blowing him sideways out of the frame.

        As the music continues we...

        Frost on the grass. We find a CADET staring down at the
        corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench,
        outlined in silver frost.

        The music ends.


<b>256     INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               256
</b>
        Prideaux sits on his bed. From outside - the sound of a
        football game. Someone taps on the door. Low. Taps again.
        Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.


<b>257     EXT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               257
</b>
        Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot-
        scrape made in woodwork.

<b>                            ROACH
</b>                  I made you something.

        Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.

<b>                            PRIDEAUX
</b>                  I don't want you hanging around
                  here. Keep away from me from now
                  on. Go and join the others.

        Roach stands frozen.

<b>                            PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
</b>                  Just bloody join in. Go and play
                  damn you.

        He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand
        mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to
        kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.


257aA   EXT. PARIS DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING                     257aA

        Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a
        cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in
        the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a
        moment it looks like Irina.
<b>                                                                         115.
</b>


       Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares
       after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again.


<b>257A   EXT./INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                257A

       Smiley walks back into the lobby, hesitates for a moment,
       then pushes on through the turnstile.


<b>258    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         258
</b>
       George takes his place at the baronial chair. He examines
       the CHESS PIECE in his hand. We see it is labelled KARLA.
       He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table
       in front of him, clears his throat.

<b>                           SMILEY
</b>                 Shall we begin?

       Through the open door Smiley's new inner circle begin to
       enter and take their place at the table around him.
