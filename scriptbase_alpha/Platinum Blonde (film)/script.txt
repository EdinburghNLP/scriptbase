                         General atmosphere, typical of a busy 
                         newspaper office. Copy boys running 
                         about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite 
                         men pounding away on typewriters. Little 
                         wire baskets containing cylinders of 
                         copy whizzing back and forth, such as 
                         are used in some department stores, 
                         etc.

                         (Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone 
                         bells and all other sounds relative 
                         to a newspaper office)
                                      
                         When shot has been fully established:

                         It takes in the battery of Morkrum machines 
                         clattering away; the crescent-shaped 
                         copy desk; the desk of the sporting 
                         editor, with a big cauliflower-eared 
                         pugilist and his manager standing by 
                         the side of the sporting editor, a hefty 
                         guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big 
                         cigar and wearing a green eye-shade; 
                         the desk of the society editor, a prissy 
                         old lady, who takes down a worn copy 
                         of the Blue Book as the camera passes 
                         her and starts looking up some data; 
                         and any other interesting or typical 
                         bits that can be thought out. At the 
                         far end of the room is the desk of Conroy, 
                         the City Editor.
                                      
                         Everything shows evidence of feverish 
                         activity and great haste.

                         guys - a lot of hard luck stories. You

                         a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding

                         On the other side of the screen. Stew 
                         Smith is holding something in his hand. 
                         His hat tilted back on his head, and 
                         he is regarding this plaything intently. 
                         Gallagher is sitting close to him, also 
                         gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher 
                         is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] 
                         on the newspaper, dressed in a trim 
                         but inexpensive little tailored suit.

                         On the object in his hand, one of those 
                         hand-puzzles where you have to land 
                         jumping beans in the holes.

                         Stew, your hands are shaking. You've 
                         been drinking again.

                         Conroy's shouts are heard in the background.

                         the last one, there's a certain sob 
                         sister I know that's going to get a 
                         kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops,

                         The Copy Boy races over to whisper something 
                         to Conroy.

                         corner.

                         A wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering 
                         suspiciously on something. With his 
                         eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out 
                         and grasps a heavy telephone book on 
                         the corner of his desk. Still looking 
                         off, he heaves it forcefully.

                         Showing the screen. The telephone book 
                         crashes into it, overturning it and 
                         revealing Stew and Gallagher on the 
                         other side. They both look up, startled. 
                         The newsroom erupts in laughter.

                         You're always picking on me. It took 
                         me three hours to get those little gadgets 
                         in those holes, and you screw it up 
                         in a minute. Hey, look!
                                      
                         He gives the hand-puzzle to Conroy, 
                         who is immediately captivated by the 
                         fascinating object in his hand.

                         Conroy puts it down with a disgusted 
                         look.

                         it be imposing too much upon you if 
                         I asked you to do a little work today? 
                         Just to sort of break the monotony?

                         It isn't a question of knowing what 
                         to do, it's knowing how to get in one 
                         that counts.

                         with that chorus dame.

                         the usual dissipated, spoiled look. 
                         His fingers are nipping out little chunks 
                         of a folded piece of paper, dropping 
                         the bits on the floor. This is indicative 
                         of a habit of the individual in question 
                         when undergoing nervous stress. He is 
                         very fidgety and apprehensive, as he 
                         glances around.

                         dame, stern and glowering. Her attitude 
                         indicates suppressed nervousness and 
                         anger. She glares over in the direction 
                         of Michael. Then she turns and looks 
                         in another direction.

                         back!

                         completing the pacing of a few short 
                         steps in his best courtroom manner, 
                         his head bowed in an attitude of deepest 
                         thought. He is dressed in striped afternoon 
                         trousers and black coat. He turns to 
                         regard Mrs. Schuyler.

                         But I keep telling you how difficult 
                         it is, Mrs. Schuyler. The last time 
                         I asked her for those letters, she made 
                         very uncouth noises with her mouth.

                         keep from laughing.

                         To reveal a full shot of the room and 
                         group. They are in the magnificent drawing 
                         room of the Schuyler home, resembling 
                         the Union Depot and furnished with almost 
                         imperial splendor and magnificence. 
                         They very much resemble a jury in session. 
                         As they continue:

                         I don't know why you're making all this 
                         fuss. I only sent her six of them.

                         If you had to make a fool of yourself, 
                         why didn't you tell it to her instead 
                         of writing?
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Because I couldn't get her on the phone.

                         You should have known better than to 
                         write, Romeo. I found that out a long 
                         time ago.

                         I should say you had. At the rate you 
                         two are going, we'll have to leave the 
                         country to save our faces.

                         Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to 
                         Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save 
                         a face.

                         Oh, shut up!
                                     
                         A butler appears in the doorway. He 
                         is about to say something, but he stammers 
                         and turns.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         (stopping him)
                                     
                         What is it, Smythe?
                                     
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Pardon me, madam - but what am I to 
                         say to the newspapermen?
                                      
                         Mrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at 
                         Grayson.

                         Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises 
                         and speaks imperiously:
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians 
                         I have nothing to say.
                                      
                         Grayson faces her placatingly.
                                     
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         You can't do that. Leave it to me. I 
                         know how to handle reporters.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         (with a shudder)
                                     
                         All right, then - get it over with.

                         Grayson turns officiously toward the 
                         waiting butler.
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         We've decided to see the reporters. 
                         Send in the man from the Tribune first.

                         Very good, sir.
                                     
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, 
                         quick - double strength. I know those 
                         news mongrels[3] will upset me.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate 
                         is ready.
                                      
                         The butler exits.

                         This room resembles the Grand Central 
                         Station. It is lined with bookcases 
                         filled with gorgeous first editions 
                         and special bindings, and is furnished 
                         in the extreme of magnificence and luxury.
 
                                                              
                         Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter 
                         from the Tribune. Stew is seated, idly 
                         leafing through a first edition.
                                      
                         Bingy, still with his hat on, spots 
                         an expensive music box on a nearby table, 
                         opens it and does a little jig to the 
                         tune that is emitted.

                         Bingy, as he lingers at the table. He 
                         is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face 
                         needs a shave and his pants need pressing. 
                         There is a spot of dried ketchup on 
                         his tie. On the table is a humidor. 
                         Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful 
                         of cigars.

                         As he looks up from the book, he suggests:

                         Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware 
                         in the dining room.
                                      
                         CONTINUATION, SCENE 20
                                     
                         Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his 
                         pocket.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Much obliged.

                         Smythe enters.
                                     
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         (frigidly)
                                     
                         Mr. Grayson has decided to see you.

                         Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly. 
                         Smythe continues:

                         Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed.

                         There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.

                         I understand, sir.
                                     
                         Smythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes 
                         by, Stew trips him.

                         my boy. No use you hanging around here. 
                         Just buy the Tribune tonight and read 
                         all about it. You can rewrite it for 
                         your last edition.

                         Couldn't make the last edition. It'd 
                         take me four hours to translate your

                         Oh, is that so?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         I'm afraid.
                                     
                         Bingy turns to leave.
                                     
                         Take off your hat. You might make an 
                         impression.
                                      
                         Bingy dutifully doffs his hat.
                                     
                         Impossible. Put it on again.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Hey, make up your mind, will you?
                                     
                         Bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on 
                         as he disappears.

                         - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
                                      
                         By the door which leads out into the 
                         hall. The butler enters and stops, standing 
                         stiffly. Bingy enters behind him, shambling 
                         awkwardly. He stops in some consternation 
                         as he sees:
                                      
                         25. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM HIS ANGLE)
                                     
                         The Schuyler jury. Grayson, Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         Anne and Michael, all surveying him 
                         in varying degrees of unfriendliness.

                         Bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards 
                         this impressive assemblage. Quickly, 
                         he takes his hat back off. Then he smiles 
                         nervously and starts forward.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Hi, folks!

                         CONTINUATION, SCENE 25
                                     
                         Grayson comes forward to meet him, attempting 
                         to be very cordial. Bingy is seized 
                         by a sudden impulse to sneeze. He does 
                         so, violently. There is awkward silence. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler throws off a visible shudder.
 
                                                              
                         BINGY
                                     
                         What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless 
                         you' in the crowd?
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         You're the Tribune man?
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Yeah, hello. How are you?
                                     
                         Bingy extends his hand. Grayson pointedly 
                         ignores it.
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         (cordially)
                                     
                         Fine. Have a seat.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Thanks, I will.
                                     
                         Bingy crosses the room, taking note 
                         of the beauteous Anne.

                         This way.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, man!
                                     
                         Bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a 
                         handsome chair.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, boy!

                         Bingy and Grayson. Grayson picks up 
                         a very flossy and expensive cigarette 
                         box from the small end table beside 
                         the chair. It is made of gold and semi-precious 
                         stones are inset in the cover. Grayson 
                         opens the lid and takes out a cigarette, 
                         but pointedly does not offer one to 
                         Bingy.
                                      
                         Grayson remains standing before the 
                         reporter, who is very uncomfortable 
                         and ill at ease.

                         Well, I should say!

                         I knew your managing editor very well.

                         Is that so?

                         She clears her throat menacingly, as 
                         she looks sternly at Grayson.

                         What's the matter? She got a cold?

                         Bingy and Grayson. Both look over. Grayson 
                         gives her a quick reassuring glance, 
                         as though to say "leave it to me now." 
                         He continues his conversation with the 
                         reporter.

                         He laughs.

                         of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.

                         hold it against you. But you see, I'm 
                         here to find out about—

                         in the story whatsoever.

                         Grayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy by 
                         the arm and leads him over to a corner 
                         of the room, assuming a confidential 
                         pose.

                         Grayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an 
                         envelope out of his pocket and hands 
                         it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and 
                         sees the contents.

                         Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up. 
                         Grayson is watching him closely.

                         So, you see how silly that rumor is?

                         think of it.
                                      
                         Grayson starts leading him toward the

                         leads him toward the door, talking as

                         They stop at the door. Bingy extends 
                         a handshake, which is again refused. 
                         He stops and looks back at the jury.

                         The Schuylers all sitting silently and 
                         contemplating him.

                         He flutters his eyes at Anne.

                         He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler 
                         and is again gripped by a violent sneeze.

                         The butler appears in the doorway behind 
                         him. Bingy exits past him, beaming.

                         The group awaiting the advent of the 
                         Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the 
                         butler, still carrying the Conrad book 
                         in his hand. They give him the once-over. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with 
                         a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them 
                         with animation, not in the slightest 
                         discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. 
                         He starts toward them.

                         As Stew approaches them.

                         Schuyler's the name, I presume? Yes,

                         - Stewart Smith. No relation to John, 
                         Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't 
                         have everything.
                                      
                         He smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses 
                         Mrs. Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding 
                         her expression of obvious distaste.

                         put out by all the rumors going around.

                         Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only 
                         ten thousand—and you didn't even get 
                         those letters from that Jezebel!

                         Oh, so you did give her ten thousand 
                         dollars, eh? and there are letters .

                         Behind Stew's back, Grayson makes violent 
                         gestures for her to shut up.

                         He takes Stew's arm and walks him off

                         as he handled Bingy, and lowers his

                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         I have it here.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Good.
                                     
                         Grayson takes an envelope out of his 
                         pocket and hands it to Stew. Stew puts 
                         the book under his arm, takes the envelope 
                         and extracts the contents. It is another 
                         greenback.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (with interest)
                                     
                         Fifty bucks, eh?
                                     
                         He regards it a moment, then replaces 
                         the bill in the envelope. His voice 
                         is matter-of-fact, and almost casual.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Don't you know you should never offer 
                         a newspaper man more than two dollars? 
                         If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit. 
                         I don't need fifty dollars. As a matter 
                         of fact, I've got fifty dollars.
                                      
                         Grayson is considerably disconcerted. 
                         He tries again.
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly 
                         satisfied.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never 
                         saw fifty dollars before. You could 
                         have bought him for six bits. Funny 
                         thing about Bingy. The more he gets 
                         - the more he prints. He looks stupid, 
                         doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets 
                         when he bends over a typewriter.
                                      
                         He hands the envelope back to Grayson 
                         and turns away.

                         Schuyler group - taking his action with 
                         dismay. Stew starts walking back toward 
                         them, talking as he walks, Grayson beside 
                         him, considerably distracted.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         So ten grand was the amount you gave 
                         the girl? Any other statement you folks 
                         would like to make?
                                      
                         There is an explosive chorus from the 
                         group.

                         That's not so!
                                     
                         We have nothing more to say!
                                     
                         We'll make no statements.
                                     
                         He turns to them, holding up his hand 
                         and speaking plaintively.

                         Wait a minute. Don't get excited. I 
                         wouldn't worry about it. A little publicity 
                         never hurt anybody.

                         She is on the point of an apopletic 
                         stroke. She advances menacingly toward 
                         Stew. She calls to Grayson.

                         Stew is not at all perturbed. Dexter 
                         takes him by the arm and starts to lead 
                         him out.

                         story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly 
                         ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—

                         Anne continues in her most devastating 
                         manner.

                         She puts her hand lightly on his arm.

                         42. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson. 
                         All watching the couple intently, hanging 
                         on the next words—wondering if Anne 
                         is going to succeed. They are tense 
                         and expectant.

                         He is looking down into her soft, melting 
                         eyes. Then he smiles.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         You know something, lady, if you sold 
                         life insurance, I'd go for a policy 
                         in sixty seconds.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.

                         The three. They relax and exchange relieved 
                         and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne 
                         has won.

                         Stew turns aside.

                         ANNE

                         Certainly. Right over there.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         You're all right.
                                     
                         She indicates. Stew starts for the telephone. 
                         Anne walks to her mother's side. Stew 
                         gets to the telephone and picks up the 
                         receiver.
                                      
                         STEW

                         (he turns to wink at the group)
                                     
                         That's an unlucky number. You know that, 
                         don't you?
                                      
                         45. CLOSE SHOT - STEW
                                     
                         At the telephone. He turns back to the 
                         instrument as he gets his connection.

                         Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give 
                         me Conroy.
                                      
                         (pause)
                                     
                         He isn't? Try the washroom, will you?
 
                                                              
                         While he waits for the connection, he 
                         turns and addresses the group expansively.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other 
                         day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little 
                         eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any 
                         garters. Neither do I as a matter of 
                         fact. What good are garters anyway—?
 
                                                              
                         (he turns back to the phone)
                                     
                         Hello, Conroy? This is Smith talking. 
                         I'm up at the Schuylers. No, I'm not 
                         having tea - that is, not yet.
                                      
                         (again, he winks expansively at the 
                         group—then returns to Conroy)
                                      
                         Is she beautiful? Oh boss, her pictures 
                         don't do her justice. If I was that 
                         guy Ziegfield - what?
                                      
                         ? 19 ?

                         Anne smiles in spite of herself at this 
                         flattery. Stew's voice goes on.
                                      
                         STEW'S VOICE
                                     
                         Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty 
                         comes from. From her mother.
                                      
                         For the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends 
                         to the extent of giving forth a smile. 
                         She cannot help but be pleased at this 
                         compliment. The atmosphere is now very 
                         friendly. Everybody feels that everything 
                         is all right.

                         Stew at the phone
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep 
                         your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The 
                         Schuylers admit the story is true. Right. 
                         They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. 
                         But she's got some letters - and she's 
                         holding out for more dough - and it 
                         looks to me like she's going to get 
                         it.

                         Horrified and shocked at this betrayal 
                         and double-crossing.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (on the phone—breezily)
                                     
                         Right boss. I'll be right over. Right 
                         - no, I don't think I can get any pictures 
                         now. Right.
                                      
                         He casually hangs up and turns from 
                         the phone.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER

                         Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile 
                         of the lowest order.
                                      
                         ANNE

                         I've met some rotters in my time, but 
                         without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse 
                         for a man I've ever had the misfortune 
                         to meet—
                                      
                         Stew starts walking toward the door, 
                         still holding his book. The family is 
                         tremendously indignant and agitated.
 
                                                              
                         Stew stops, turns, looks at them. He 
                         is met by icy glares. He indignantly 
                         takes a nickel out of his pocket and 
                         hands it to Grayson.
                                      
                         STEW

                         Well, if you feel that way about it, 
                         here's a nickel for the phone call.
 
                                                              
                         He glares at them—turns and walks out.
 
                                                              
                         They watch him walk out, stunned and 
                         open-mouthed.

                         A reasonably respectable speakeasy, 
                         smoke-filled. Quite a number of men 
                         and a few women are leaning on the bar 
                         and seated around at the tables. Stew 
                         and Gallagher are seated at one of the 
                         rude round tables, smoking, drinks before 
                         them. Gallagher is reading the newspaper 
                         story.

                         She is grinning at the story.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         —and she walked up to me and put her 
                         hand on my shoulder and said,

                         Over Stew's shoulder. She laughs at 
                         his attempted imitation.

                         Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!

                         I hope not . . . I've got to call on 
                         her this morning!
                                      
                         Gallagher looks up in astonishment.

                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. 
                         Her wounds need soothing.
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely 
                         bats? What for? I thought the story 
                         was cold. You can't go back there.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. 
                         I'm sizzling - look! Psst!

                         He moistens a finger, touches it to 
                         his wrist, and makes a sizzle noise.
 
                                                              
                         Gallagher looks over quizzically—a little 
                         suspicious—a little jealous.

                         STEW
                                     
                         And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, 
                         you've got to meet her. She's it—

                         —and that—
                                     
                         STEW

                         Gallagher takes a sip of her drink before 
                         answering.
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         Well, I've seen her pictures, and I 
                         don't think she's so hot.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (disparaging gesture)
                                     
                         Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures 
                         don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, 
                         she's queenly - she is queenly - and 
                         I know queens!
                                      
                         (continues in exaltation)
                                     
                         And oh, has she got herself a nose - 
                         and I know noses too. That little snozzle 
                         of hers is the berries, I tell you. 
                         And is she cute when she throws that 
                         little snozzle to the high heavens!

                         Of course I haven't got a nose.
                                     
                         Stew gives her a hurt look.

                         Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. 
                         You've got a nose. But there's different 
                         women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery 
                         horses and thoroughbreds.

                         On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. 
                         I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.

                         Well!

                         During these last few speeches, Gallagher 
                         has been regarding him with a curious 
                         expression. She loves being his pal, 
                         but wishes he would realize she is also 
                         a woman.

                         Stew seems a little resentful of her 
                         attitude. He rises.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Pay that check, will you Gallagher? 
                         I'll give it back to you some time. 
                         Maybe.
                                      
                         He flourishes the book of Conrad, which 
                         has been lying on the table in front 
                         of him, and makes a grand gesture.

                         I go now - I go with Conrad in quest 
                         of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will 
                         you, Gallagher?
                                      
                         He strikes a pose—and exits.
                                     
                         Gallagher, sits, looking after him, 
                         considerably disturbed.

                         Sitting, looking dismally after Stew.
 
                                                              
                         She opens her bag and takes out a mirror, 
                         surveying herself with frank disapproval. 
                         She pulls out a curl of hair before 
                         each ear, tries to soften the severe 
                         brim of the hat. She puts a finger to 
                         the tip of her nose and tilts it up, 
                         studying the effect. Then, with a sigh 
                         of disgust, she throws mirror and bag 
                         onto the table.

                         Smythe, the butler, previously introduced, 
                         comes from the direction of the rear 
                         of the house, and proceeds down the 
                         long, vast hallway towards the front 
                         door. The bell keeps ringing steadily.
 
                                                              
                         The butler reaches the wide front door.

                         As the butler opens the door and reveals 
                         Stew standing outside, hatless, a book 
                         in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly 
                         askew, the pockets bulging with contents. 
                         The butler quickly tries to slam the 
                         door in Stew's face, but Stew's right 
                         foot comes forward with a practiced 
                         newspaperman's gesture and he forces 
                         his way into the room.

                         it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't

                         The name is Smythe.

                         Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.

                         I know, I know. I waited outside till 
                         she went out. She's a very nice lady, 
                         but we don't vibrate well together.

                         Anne, dressed in smart sports clothes, 
                         starts to cross thru the hall. She stops 
                         as she sees the butler engaged in conversation 
                         with Stew.

                         No one's at home, sir.
                                     
                         Anne starts walking toward them. Stew 
                         spots her.

                         Now Jeeves, what would you call this 
                         - 'no one'?
                                      
                         Anne comes up to them.
                                     
                         59. CLOSER THREE SHOT
                                     
                         Anne looks up and sees that the butler 
                         is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses 
                         him.

                         Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that 
                         if this person came here again, I was 
                         to call the police.

                         That's a good idea - telephone the police. 
                         The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple 
                         of cops over and we can have a rubber 
                         of bridge.

                         The butler bows stiffly and exits.

                         (to Stew—directly)
                                     
                         What do you want?

                         Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was 
                         here, I had one of your books in my 
                         hand, and when I got outside, I realized 
                         I still had your book in my hand. So 
                         as long as I had your book in my hand, 
                         I thought I might as well take it home 
                         and read it. This morning, I got up 
                         and put your book in my hand, and here's 
                         your book in your hand.
                                      
                         He extends the Conrad book, and Anne, 
                         making no effort to take it, he throws 
                         it on the table.

                         That's considerate of you.

                         Yeah, that was considerate of me. I 
                         recommend you read it.

                         Perhaps if you'd like something lighter

                         a rubber band. He extracts one of them

                         (brightly)
                                     
                         But Bobo is your brother, Michael. And 
                         of course nobody would ever guess who 
                         Babykins is.
                                      
                         Anne turns and stares at him, incredulously, 
                         for a moment.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Where did you get those letters?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         I stole them when I was interviewing 
                         Babykins about Bobo.
                                      
                         Anne looks up coldly.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I suppose you're going to print them?

                         No - give you another guess.

                         The two.
                                     
                         Anne surveys him with frank scorn and 
                         dislike.

                         Oh, I don't need another guess. It's 
                         quite obvious.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         So, it's obvious, huh?
                                     
                         She turns toward the library.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Will you step into the library?
                                     
                         STEW

                         Anne walks majestically with head held 
                         high—thru the hall—thru the living room 
                         and to the library. CAMERA TRUCKING 
                         AHEAD OF THEM. This is a very long walk 
                         with Anne walking ahead, Stew trailing.

                         You know, the Indians used to walk like 
                         this.

                         You know why that was? That was in case 
                         of attack from the front.

                         Of course, if the attack was from the 
                         rear, she had to depend upon her papoose.

                         Oh yes, the papooses always had bows 
                         and arrows.

                         Of course, if she wasn't married—then 
                         she'd have to protect her own - er,

                         Miss Schuyler, how about carfare back 
                         to the front door, huh?

                         Anne sweeps in, followed by Stew. She 
                         walks directly to a desk, opens a drawer 
                         and takes out a large check book. She 
                         draws up a chair and seats herself.

                         As Stew walks closer and addreses her.

                         Anne has been listening to him with

                         obvious sincerity.

                         to kiss you.

                         I know but that was news. This is blackmail 
                         and I don't like blackmail.
                                      
                         Anne is regarding him with searching 
                         scrutiny. She smiles. Her icy, belligerent

                         great favor. I wish there was something 
                         I could do for you—
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Well, you could make this table a little 
                         - uh - a little less wide.
                                      
                         (he leans over closer to her)
                                     
                         There is something you can do for me, 
                         Miss Schuyler.
                                      
                         The smile goes out of Anne's eyes—the 
                         suspicion returns—she is saying to herself—"I 
                         was right the first time!"

                         I haven't had any lunch yet. Have you 
                         got anything in the icebox?
                                      
                         The hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's 
                         face as she stares at this incredible 
                         guy with his incredible request. With 
                         a twinkle in her eyes, she responds:

                         A lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes 
                         and colorful painted furniture. Stew 
                         and Anne are sitting at the table. Anne 
                         looks amused and

                         definitely speculative. Stew has the 
                         manner of having lived in this house 
                         all his life. He draws the cup of tea 
                         to him and puts in a lump or two of 
                         sugar.
                                      
                         Between him and Anne on the corner of 
                         the table is a modernistic, squatty 
                         little tea-pot.

                         After years of research, I finally discovered 
                         that I was the only guy in the world 
                         who hadn't written a play, so believe 
                         it or not, in my spare time I'm now 
                         writing a play.

                         Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot 
                         yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.

                         Stew helps himself to another lump of 
                         sugar.

                         Naw, that's just a symbol of my independence.
 
                                                              
                         He leans closer, looking directly into 
                         her face.

                         I'm color blind. That's what's wrong 
                         - I'm color blind. I've been sitting 
                         here for a half hour looking at you 
                         and I don't know yet whether your eyes 
                         are blue or violet.
                                      
                         Anne smiles at this unexpected statement, 
                         and stares at him very critically.

                         I'm just beginning to believe that something 
                         could be done with you.

                         me.

                         Now getting back to those eyes of yours 
                         - would you mind if I kind of got closer 
                         so I could see them?

                         enters and stops in the doorway, surveying

                         I can't tell whether they're blue, or 
                         whether they're violet. What would you

                         I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but 
                         I get it. It's all right.

                         Mrs. Schuyler freezes in inarticulate 
                         anger, as Stew gives a courtly bow and

                         There is the sound of a piano chord 
                         being struck.
                                      
                         81. MED. FULL SHOT
                                     
                         Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing 
                         importantly by the grand piano at which 
                         is seated an anaemic-looking young man. 
                         Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian 
                         with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter 
                         bows toward the swarthy one, who bends 
                         almost double in acknowledgement. There 
                         is a polite scattering of applause, 
                         and some of the guests seat themselves.
 
                                                              
                         Martini starts to sing.
                                     
                         Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne 
                         slip out of the door into the roof garden.

                         A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose 
                         trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, 
                         a splashing fountain, a few choice marble 
                         statues, low, deep chairs placed to 
                         make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne 
                         enter from the direction of the house. 
                         The garden is dark except for the lights 
                         from the interior of the house. From 
                         within, comes the voice of the singer 
                         rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental 
                         Italian love song. This will continue 
                         to the FADE OUT of the scene.
                                      
                         Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, 
                         toward the edge of the pergola where 
                         the shadows are deeper and where a couple 
                         of glorified steamer chairs are placed. 
                         There is a full moon overhead.
                                      
                         She leads him toward a waterfall effect, 
                         a glass partition down which water trickles. 
                         They go behind the dimly lit fountain 
                         and sit
                                      
                         ? 33 ?
                                     
                         in a low, deep divan. We see them in 
                         silhouette as they go into a passionate 
                         embrace. All we hear is the faint voice 
                         of Martini—and the uninterrupted splashing 
                         of the fountain.

                         On divan, arms around each other.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out 
                         of here. Give me the air. Throw me out 
                         of this joint, will you?
                                      
                         Anne smiles happily and pinches his 
                         nose.

                         Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, 
                         darling?

                         Throw me out - because I'm beginning 
                         to get goofy ideas, and they concern 
                         you, Anne.
                                      
                         ANNE

                         None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, 
                         if they concern me.

                         My name is Smith - well, that you seem 
                         to have been able to stand for the last 
                         month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. 
                         I've never been in jail - that is, not 
                         often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. 
                         I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like 
                         black coffee and I hate garters. I make 
                         seventy-five bucks a week and I've got 
                         eight hundred and forty-seven bucks 
                         in the bank - and - I don't know yet 
                         whether your eyes are blue or violet.

                         (although he is very close to her)
 
                                                              
                         That's because you're too far away, 
                         Stew.
                                      
                         Throughout his speech, Anne never takes 
                         her eyes off him. As he fumbles now, 
                         he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming 
                         desire for Anne overcomes him.
                                      
                         He dismisses as futile his effort to 
                         be practical, sweeps her into his arms 
                         and kisses her passionately.

                         Featuring Stew at his desk, which is 
                         directly in front of the battery of 
                         Morkrums whose clatter comes into the

                         Stew finishes up a phone call. He sits 
                         at his desk, staring pensively at his 
                         typewriter. He is smoking a pipe and 
                         is in his shirt-sleeves. His hair is 
                         rumpled, and strewn over the desk is 
                         a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper, 
                         indicating that he has made numerous 
                         unsuccessful starts at writing something. 
                         A fresh blank sheet of paper is now 
                         in the typewriter.
                                      
                         Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a 
                         swivel chair, with his feet elevated 
                         to the desk, the low snoring of another 
                         reporter blends with the sounds of the 
                         Morkrums and other noises of the City 
                         Room. At the reporter's elbow is a telephone.

                         Desk of Conroy, the City Editor. A small 
                         upright plate on his desk indicates 
                         his position. This is near the copy 
                         desk. Characteristic activities are 
                         background for any action that may take 
                         place. Reporters come up to throw their 
                         stories on Conroy's desk; the phone 
                         rings, etc.
                                      
                         A boy comes in with a large number of 
                         newspapers under his arm which he throws 
                         on Conroy's desk. There are several 
                         copies of each of the rival newspapers 
                         in town. Conroy spreads them out and 
                         begins to examine them.

                         It is evident that he is nervous and 
                         jumpy about something. Finally he starts 
                         to pound the typewriter.

                         of the papers. The phone rings. Without 
                         looking at it, Conroy answers:

                         He is looking down at the papers and 
                         suddenly his eyes focus on something 
                         which causes the cigar to drop from 
                         his mouth and an expression of mingled 
                         amazement and rage comes into his face. 
                         We do not see at this point what it 
                         is he has read, but we know it must 
                         be something sensational. Abruptly he 
                         hangs up the phone.

                         Stew, as he studies his typewriter. 
                         Over his CLOSEUP comes the excited outraged 
                         voice of Conroy.
                                      
                         CONROY'S VOICE

                         A look of infinite weariness and disgust 
                         comes over Stew's face and he grits 
                         his teeth.

                         His general expression registers "Good 
                         god, there he goes again." With one 
                         finger he pounds out four letters:

                         He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter.

                         Stew gets up from his machine, crumples 
                         the sheet of paper into a wad and flings 
                         it at the sleeping reporter. The wad 
                         strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly 
                         and automatically reaches for the phone. 
                         He picks up the receiver and in a voice 
                         fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew 
                         exits.

                         At Conroy's desk. Conroy's expression 
                         is one of bitter reproach as he leans 
                         back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches 
                         and stands by the desk.

                         the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister 
                         or two nearby, who look up with expectant 
                         interest, expecting to hear Stew get 
                         a bawling out.

                         Stew turns away from Conroy's desk, 
                         and a group of his confreres come up, 
                         surrounding him in a series of ad-lib 
                         congratulations. (Some slightly profane, 
                         pounding him on the back, whooping, 
                         and in general manifesting great surprise 
                         and glee.) This group is increased by 
                         copy readers, office boys and everybody 
                         jabbering and shouting at him.
                                      
                         GROUP

                         Stew manages to break thru them and 
                         exits from scene.

                         Gallagher—to intercut with above scene. 
                         She gets up and goes over, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER and picks up another copy of 
                         the paper and reads the headlines.

                         about Stew's marriage. Abruptly she 
                         turns away, out of scene.

                         At Gallagher's empty desk. Stew comes 
                         in trying to stave off the mob. He turns 
                         on the congratulators, pushing them 
                         off.

                         What's the matter with you mugs? Can't

                         walks back toward the door, the last 
                         of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers 
                         being flung after him.

                         Gallagher is seated alone at a table, 
                         looking very forlorn. Her life is suddenly 
                         empty. A drink is in front of her, untouched. 
                         She is fighting hard to keep her emotions 
                         under control.
                                      
                         Stew enters the speakeasy and mingles 
                         with patrons, who offer congratulations. 
                         He comes to a stop by the table. She 
                         looks up, forcing a smile.

                         There you are. What did you run away 
                         for?

                         Stew draws out the other chair at the 
                         table and sits down.

                         He looks across at her, grinning boyishly, 
                         utterly unaware that what he has done 
                         has hurt her deeply.

                         She puts her hand tenderly on his.

                         Stew expands under the comradeship of 
                         Gallagher. He wants to talk.

                         come down alone.

                         Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're 
                         a married man now. Mother always warned 
                         me never to run around with married 
                         men.

                         Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're 
                         not going to leave me flat?
                                      
                         Gallagher tries to be elaborately casual.

                         Oh, I'll call you up some time. And 
                         if your social duties permit - why -

                         Cut that out. Just because I'm married 
                         - there's no reason for that.
                                      
                         Gallagher looks up and off, seeing something 
                         that startles her.

                         Stew buries his head in the newspaper, 
                         in pretense of looking for something. 
                         Conroy appears at the table and stops. 
                         He indicates Stew.

                         the newspaper - his lost freedom?
 
                                                              
                         Stew slowly sticks his head up over 
                         the top of the table, looking up.

                         Well, if it isn't old Fagin[9] himself.
 
                                                              
                         Conroy sits down at the table.

                         smiling.

                         Gallagher, self-conscious, realizes 
                         this tough old buzzard is on to her. 
                         She looks back at him for a moment - 
                         then drops her head. Stew is oblivious 
                         to this by-play. Conroy turns to Stew.

                         aside.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         You stay right here, Michael. Some day 
                         you'll be head of this family, but thank 
                         heaven I shan't be here when it happens. 
                         And I hope you never have a daughter 
                         who gives you gastritis as Anne has 
                         me!
                                      
                         She pulls the bell rope for the butler.

                         Now Mother, calm yourself. There's no 
                         use in getting so excited.

                         Mrs. Schuyler is vastly agitated.
                                     
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Oh, isn't there?

                         (as Anne starts to get up)
                                     
                         Sit down!

                         The butler appears in the doorway.

                         Some bicarbonate - quick!

                         The butler bows and exits. She passes 
                         a nervous hand over her eyes. Anne comes 
                         up to her.

                         Mother, if you keep this up, you'll 
                         have a nervous breakdown before you 
                         go to Europe.

                         It's a good thing your father passed 
                         away before he saw insanity ravage the 
                         family. I can't imagine what made you 
                         do such a thing. A reporter! Of all 
                         things, a reporter! A barbarian who 
                         lets his socks come down!

                         Mother, I promise you that he won't 
                         be a reporter much longer. Once I get 
                         him away from that atmosphere and get 
                         him away from a man named Gallagher—

                         Sit down!

                         The butler enters with a tray on which 
                         is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and 
                         brings it to Mrs. Schuyler. Walking 
                         immediately behind the butler is Stew, 
                         airily debonair. The butler glances 
                         somewhat uneasily at Mrs. Schuyler as 
                         he presents the tray. She glares blackly 
                         at Stew without a word of greeting, 
                         and taking the foaming glass from the 
                         tray, starts to lift it to her lips.

                         Drink hearty, Mother.
                                     
                         Once more, Anne starts to rise out of 
                         her seat.

                         Anne!
                                     
                         Mrs. Schuyler pauses - glowering at 
                         Stew. Stew nods perfunctorily to each 
                         member of the jury, the total innocent.

                         Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson.

                         And you.
                                     
                         (to Mrs. Schuyler)
                                     
                         Mrs. Schuyler!
                                     
                         Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler, having drained the glass, 
                         dismisses the butler with a wave of 
                         the hand, and directs her attention 
                         again to the matter at hand.

                         Well, what's to be done? He's here now.
 
                                                              
                         They are all silent - reluctant to speak 
                         in front of Stew. Stew looks at them 
                         all - a little puzzled - then he walks 
                         over toward Mrs. Schuyler.

                         Nobody seems to want to do anything—

                         Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer 
                         a suggestion. Do what about what?

                         (with a tone of dismissal)
                                     
                         Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         we don't want you to go to any trouble 
                         about that. We just want the usual blessings, 
                         that's all.

                         Mrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws 
                         herself up with haughty dignity.

                         Young man, I want you to know that I 
                         object violently to this whole affair!
 
                                                              
                         This finally brings Anne out of her 
                         seat. She rises and crosses to Stew, 
                         making a show of embracing him.

                         Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly 
                         ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and 
                         I are married.

                         I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. 
                         I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         that you feel this way. I was in hopes 
                         that you would like me. I'm not the 
                         burglar that you think I am. After all, 
                         we're married. I think the thing to 
                         do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

                         This man's impossible! I can't talk 
                         to him. Grayson, let's go where we can 
                         talk - hic!
                                      
                         (she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial 
                         look at Anne)
                                      
                         See what you've done to me!?
                                     
                         Without another word, she turns and 
                         flounces angrily out of the room. Grayson 
                         follows her. At the doorway he pauses, 
                         starts to say something. They all look 
                         at him expectantly - but no words come 
                         out.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Got it too, huh?
                                     
                         Grayson gives a harrumph and exits.

                         Anne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins 
                         at Stew.
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Who won that round?
                                     
                         Michael starts moving toward the door.

                         (ruefully)
                                     
                         I'm afraid your mother won that round 
                         - that is, she got in the last blow.
 
                                                              
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         I don't feel the way they do. You're 
                         really not as bad as everybody thinks.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         (effusively - shaking his hand)
                                     
                         You're beginning to appreciate me, eh? 
                         Thanks!
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Don't worry too much about Mother - 
                         she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs, 
                         I'll give you a little -
                                      
                         He indicates a snifter, grins and exits. 
                         Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm 
                         around his shoulder.
                                      
                         STEW

                         A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.
 
                                                              
                         (to Anne)
                                     
                         He's all right. I like him.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I'm glad.
                                     
                         He sees two figures pass above in a 
                         proscenium alcove, first Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         then Grayson. He makes an elaborate 
                         bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's 
                         return bow.

                         Anne takes a step backwards and sits 
                         down with him on one of the divans. 
                         CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts 
                         an arm about her.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Come here baby!
                                     
                         Anne starts fussing abstractedly at 
                         Stew's tie. They kiss.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I haven't seen you for three hours. 
                         You're neglecting me already—
                                      
                         During her speech she has been picking 
                         away at a stain on his tie. Stew looks 
                         down and notices it.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         What's the matter? Something I et, no 
                         doubt. Egg marks the spot—
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         I don't need any new ties. I've got 
                         another tie - I've got another one besides 
                         this one. And it's a pip, too. There's 
                         only one thing wrong with it. You know 
                         what that is? It has a little weakness 
                         for gravy, and once in a while it leans 
                         a little toward ketchup. Of course that's 
                         only in its weaker moments. When you 
                         move down to my place, I'll show it 
                         to you.
                                      
                         Anne is somewhat taken aback at the 
                         suggestion that she's to move into his 
                         place.

                         Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't 
                         compare with this coliseum of yours 
                         here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill

                         The architecture has a little feeling 
                         of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture 
                         sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance 
                         - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.

                         Oh darling, of course it would. If it 
                         isn't - there are six rooms and two

                         He gets up and paces the floor. He looks 
                         at Anne and sees that she is taking 
                         him seriously. He drops down beside 
                         her.

                         this, are you?

                         on his arm. CAMERA TRUCKS BACK showing 
                         the magnificent bedroom, with carved 
                         wooden panellings, a raised, canopied 
                         bed. The clothes that Stew has taken 
                         off the night before are draped haphazardly 
                         about the room. When the Camera gets 
                         to a point that takes in a LONG SHOT 
                         of the room, the door to the hall opens 
                         and a correctly attired valet appears. 
                         He closes the door noiselessly, goes 
                         over to the windows, and draws the brocaded 
                         drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered 
                         object and with a small flourish removes 
                         the cover - revealing a birdcage. He 
                         approaches the bed.

                         Stew kicks back the covers and sits

                         of slippers. The valet bends on one 
                         knee to help him.

                         dressing gown, but again the valet beats 
                         him to it - holding it for him and helping 
                         him slip into it.

                         The valet picks up his pants.

                         Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - 
                         she engaged me this morning, sir.
 
                                                              
                         Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, 
                         without missing a beat, leans over and 
                         offers a light. A wary Stew accepts.

                         Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, 
                         huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith 
                         - to engage me a valley.

                         Stew walks over and gets a cigarette 
                         out of a box on a small table, waving 
                         his hand in a gesture of dismissal. 
                         The valet is right behind him, holding 
                         up his bathrobe for Stew to step into.

                         Say, you are nice. You're all right. 
                         You'd make a good wife.

                         But not for me! Though I like you well 
                         enough. You're a nice fellow. You're 
                         all right. But I'm sorry I don't need 
                         any valleys today.
                                      
                         The valet pays no attention to him, 
                         but walks around the room, picking up 
                         the clothes that Stew has flung about.

                         mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, 
                         as it were. Someone to draw your bath, 
                         lay out your clothes, help to dress 
                         you - it's really most essential, sir.
 
                                                              
                         Stew, with his cigarette between his 
                         lips, stands watching the valet as he 
                         retrieves the various articles of cast-off 
                         clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat 
                         patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe 
                         and starts opening the drawers, preparatory 
                         to laying out fresh things for Stew. 
                         Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes 
                         him by the shoulder, and yanks him around 
                         to face him.

                         The valet is astonished and somewhat

                         on Stew's face.

                         my pants for thirty years all right,

                         Stew is rapidly losing his temper.

                         The valet puts a bewildered hand to 
                         his face.

                         alarmed.

                         and Anne comes in, wearing a ravishing 
                         and revealing negligee. She carries 
                         a small jeweler's box in her hand. She 
                         crosses the room toward Stew.

                         She looks over and sees Dawson at the 
                         hall door.

                         Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's 
                         clothes go to the cleaners this morning, 
                         please, will you?
                                      
                         The valet bows. Stew looks at her blankly.

                         out.

                         Stew flares in anger. Several of them

                         With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his 
                         foot forward and sends a couple of them 
                         sprawling. Stew gets to his feet.

                         I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social 
                         secretary.

                         I was sent from the Post in place of 
                         our social editor.

                         Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned 
                         me. Well, what would you like to have?

                         Why, a list of the guests. That's the 
                         usual thing, isn't it?
                                      
                         MISS WILSON
                                     
                         Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—

                         In the meantime, would you like to take 
                         a look around?

                         husband?

                         He's probably very tired. You see, he's 
                         had to meet all these people personally 
                         tonight.

                         with him, don't you? What is it you 
                         call him - the Cinderella Man?

                         Moss and Fontana are just finishing 
                         their dance. Gallagher stands in doorway 
                         with Miss Wilson, watching them. Excited 
                         voices comment on the dance. Miss Wilson 
                         beckons to Gallagher to follow her.

                         in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points 
                         out celebrated guests to her.

                         Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated 
                         gentleman.

                         Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this 
                         point they are interrupted by a butler.

                         Will you excuse me? Make yourself at

                         Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. 
                         Gallagher is left alone. She wanders 
                         about the huge ballroom, peering here 
                         and there, searching for Stew. Finally 
                         she comes to a large open French door 
                         and steps out.

                         Several groups of men and women are 
                         seated at tables. Gallagher enters from 
                         ballroom, glances quickly at all the 
                         men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, 
                         she crosses terrace and descends broad 
                         stone steps and advances into garden.

                         Stew, his head cupped in his hands, 
                         is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher 
                         wanders into scene. She sees Stew and 
                         stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, 
                         with a happy smile on her lips, moves 
                         closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes 
                         conscious of someone near him and looks 
                         suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his 
                         face breaks into a happy grin.

                         raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't 
                         got no raw life up here.

                         No, no! Maybe we could interest you 
                         in some well done butterflies, or perhaps 
                         some slightly fried pansies, or better 
                         still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed 
                         every one of them will give you a good 
                         stiff pain in the neck.

                         Say, who's been tying your ties lately? 
                         It looks rotten.

                         different about Gallagher. He takes 
                         a step back so as to look her over carefully 
                         - blinks his eyes.

                         Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What 
                         are you doing to yourself?

                         Nothing.

                         What did you do to that hair? And where 
                         did you get that dress?

                         I dyed one and washed the other.

                         Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. 
                         Well! You certainly look good.

                         Anne is walking in direction of Stew 
                         and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when 
                         she sees them. Her body stiffens.

                         ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER
                                     
                         From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing 
                         in the direction of Anne.

                         Don't turn around now - but there's 
                         a very beautiful girl up there who seems 
                         to be staring at us.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Staring at us?

                         My mistake - she's glaring.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Must be my wife.
                                     
                         He turns - sees Anne.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. 
                         Stay right there, because I'm going 
                         to bring a friend up I want you to meet.
 
                                                              
                         They exit.

                         Standing as before. She is looking off 
                         with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and 
                         Gallagher come up to her.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Anne, prepare yourself for the treat 
                         of your life. This is Gallagher.

                         Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing 
                         for the society editor tonight.
                                      
                         Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable 
                         Gallagher.

                         Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?

                         Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
                                     
                         Anne winces slightly at this name.

                         How do you do?
                                     
                         There is a short, awkward pause.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (bitter-sweet)
                                     
                         You know, Stewart, you failed to mention 
                         that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful 
                         young girl.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Gallagher?
                                     
                         Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing 
                         that he fails to get the dynamite behind 
                         Anne's casually pleasant phrases. Anne 
                         plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable 
                         now.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed 
                         to mention that Gallagher was a girl.

                         Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?

                         Stew is beginning to realize that all 
                         is not well as it could be.

                         You see, we never look at Gallagher 
                         as a girl—
                                      
                         He breaks off.

                         No? What do you look upon her as?

                         Why, down at the office, we always look 
                         at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, 
                         that's all.

                         Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.

                         Goodbye, Stew—
                                     
                         She leaves scene.

                         Stew turns and faces her.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         That was kind of a rotten thing to do, 
                         Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. 
                         The least you can do is be courteous 
                         to her.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll 
                         go and apologize.
                                      
                         He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's 
                         direction.

                         Stewart, please!
                                     
                         She glares angrily at the departing 
                         Stew.

                         Gallagher has just reached the ballroom 
                         when Stew catches up to her.

                         I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am 
                         sorry.

                         (reassuringly)
                                     
                         Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. 
                         As far as she's concerned, I'm just 
                         part of the hired help.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne 
                         act that way before. (pause) It's funny 
                         I never thought to tell her you were 
                         a girl, isn't it?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         Yes.

                         The butler is just opening the door. 
                         Bingy, looking more disreputable than 
                         usual, steps inside.

                         Hello, there, Meadows![13]

                         Who is it you wish to see, sir?
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse 
                         me - I mean Mr. Smith.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We 
                         are having a reception here this evening—
 
                                                              
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times 
                         and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy 
                         who loves parties. You know—
                                      
                         He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed 
                         ladies strolling by.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         —a beautiful pair of shoulders! But 
                         listen now, as a favor, will you please 
                         make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] 
                         and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him 
                         because if you don't my whole family's 
                         going to die.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have 
                         a seat.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Well, I got a seat, but I have no place 
                         to put it.
                                      
                         The butler turns to leave, then turns 
                         back, his face expressing distinct disapproval.

                         Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that 
                         one before.

                         Stew and Gallagher standing together. 
                         The butler is seen leaving the scene, 
                         having just informed Stew of Bingy's 
                         presence at the reception.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (to Gallagher)
                                     
                         Excuse me. I just want to make sure 
                         and see he doesn't take away any of 
                         the vases.
                                      
                         (starts to leave, then turns back)
 
                                                              
                         Well, well, well! My little pal, Gallagher, 
                         a girl, huh?
                                      
                         (unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her 
                         hand)
                                      
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         That's just to give you an idea that 
                         I know how to treat a gal. Get fresh 
                         with me and I'll sock you in that little 
                         nose of yours. Excuse me. I'll be right 
                         back.
                                      
                         He exits. Gallagher is left staring 
                         at her hand wonderingly.

                         Bingy gets up from his throne chair, 
                         and crosses into the doorway of the 
                         library opposite him. He stops by a 
                         carved low-boy, and curiously examines 
                         a large antique vase. Stew comes in 
                         and stops with a smile as he sees him.
 
                                                              
                         Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up. 
                         Stew walks over to him.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (referring to vase)
                                     
                         What's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy 
                         to get in your pocket?
                                      
                         Bingy sets down the vase and surveys 
                         him.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         No. I was just looking at it. Pretty, 
                         ain't it? I was just looking for the 
                         price tag.

                         Bingy looks him up and down in silent, 
                         insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn.

                         What do you want?
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted

                         Mrs. Schuyler gets up. Paces wildly 
                         about room. In a frenzy.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         I knew it! I knew it! I felt it in my

                         She is interrupted by the entrance of 
                         Grayson, who dashes into the room, his 
                         eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy 
                         of the morning paper.

                         Stew, now dressed in a business suit, 
                         comes from the direction of the stairs 
                         and stops just before he gets to the 
                         door of the drawing room. From within 
                         there is an ominous silence. Stew looks 
                         longingly in the direction of the front 
                         door - then back at the drawing room, 
                         squares his shoulders and goes in.

                         As Stew stops just inside the doorway. 
                         He had been prepared for this, but it 
                         strikes terror into his soul, just the 
                         same.

                         From his angle in the doorway. The jury 
                         - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back 
                         - is standing, gazing at Stew with a 
                         fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. 
                         Anne is crying softly.

                         Stew - looking around at the gallery

                         to his face as he starts to enter, whistling 
                         as he goes.

                         That's the fourteenth crack you've made 
                         to me. I'm keeping count. When you get 
                         to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right 
                         on the nose. As a matter of fact, I 
                         ought to sock you right now.

                         Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit 
                         there and watch this man insult us? 
                         Haven't you any decency left?

                         Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? 
                         And you might show some too, Mother. 
                         What do you expect a man to do when 
                         he's called such names?

                         I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. 
                         He deserved it.

                         Grayson turns to go, then braves the 
                         last word.

                         He leaves in a huff. Stew puts his arms 
                         around the crying Anne.

                         Six or eight people of distinction scattered 
                         around the room. All dressed in full 
                         evening clothes. Among them is Grayson, 
                         Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's 
                         uniform. The men have their coats and 
                         hats in their hands, the women have 
                         their evening wraps on. Apparently they 
                         are ready to leave for someplace and 
                         are being detained. An indistinct murmur 
                         of ad-lib conversation is heard.

                         with his dress tie. He pauses, his hands 
                         still on his tie.

                         As he struggles with his collar, it 
                         springs off.

                         Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason 
                         I've never wanted to go out with those 
                         social parasites, those sweet-smelling 
                         fashion plates. I don't like them. They 
                         bore me. They give me the jitters.

                         Do you know you're talking about my 
                         friends?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yes, I'm talking about your friends, 
                         and they still give me the jitters.

                         Well, are you going - or aren't you?
 
                                                              
                         Stew makes a move to embrace her.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Anne, come here. Listen—
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (sternly - slipping away from him)
 
                                                              
                         Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         I'll tell you what. Let's you and me 
                         sneak out all by ourselves—
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (interrupting)
                                     
                         Are you crazy?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Think of the fun we can have - we'll 
                         sneak down the back stairs and get in 
                         the valet's Ford. How's that?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         (trying hard)
                                     
                         I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take 
                         you and introduce you to all my gang. 
                         Would you like that?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (hard)
                                     
                         But I don't want to meet your gang.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         I don't mean the newspaper fellows that 
                         you don't like. Another gang I know 
                         - you'd love them. They're writers and 
                         musicians and artists - a great crowd 
                         of people - people who do great things. 
                         People who are worthwhile.

                         ANNE
                                     
                         Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, 
                         I suppose?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
 
                                                              
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (interrupting belligerently)
                                     
                         That's exactly what you mean. Heaven 
                         knows you've made that clear to me often 
                         enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of 
                         it. I've given you party after party 
                         - I've taken you to some of the best 
                         houses in this town - and introduced 
                         you to people of importance - and are 
                         you grateful? No! You insult them and 
                         act like a bore. I'm sick and tired 
                         of having to make excuses for you and 
                         the things that you've done. Perhaps 
                         it's just as well you're not coming 
                         tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for 
                         once without having to worry about you, 
                         and what you're going to do.
                                      
                         With which violent declaration, she 
                         flounces out of the room, leaving Stew 
                         staring after her, angry and hurt. Impulsively, 
                         he follows her to the door - a retort 
                         on his lips. When he gets there, however, 
                         she has vanished. He returns to the 
                         room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts 
                         cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks 
                         to window - stares out - turns back 
                         to room - heaves a lonely sigh.
                                      
                         He notices his reflection in the mirror, 
                         and gestures toward it.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         And that, my friends, is what is known 
                         as the society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter

                         As Stew sits in a typewriter chair. 
                         He rolls up the sheet in the machine 
                         so that he can read what is already 
                         written.

                         AN HACIENDA IN MEXICO
                                     
                         Strumming of guitars are dimly heard.
 
                                                              
                         BACK TO SCENE:
                                     
                         He studies it for a moment, frowning 
                         in dissatisfaction. He's stuck. He leans 
                         back in the chair and looks up for inspiration.

                         INT. SCHUYLER GRAND FOYER
                                     
                         185. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer. 
                         Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by 
                         the surroundings. He tries hopscotching 
                         on the pattern of the floor. That wears 
                         thin quickly. Supremely bored, Stew 
                         gives a shout and is rewarded with a 
                         cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then 
                         appears, nervously crouched behind some 
                         grillwork.

                         Did you call, sir?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Smythe, come here. I want to talk to 
                         you.
                                      
                         (Smythe looks unenthusiastic.)
                                     
                         Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, 
                         I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this 
                         house! This big . . . come on, I'm not 
                         going to hurt you. Come on, what's the 
                         matter with you?
                                      
                         Stew gives another shout and is rewarded 
                         with another loud echo. This coaxes 
                         Smythe out from behind the grillwork.

                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Yes, sir.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         You try it.

                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yeah.
                                     
                         Smythe gives it a timid try.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, no. Give it more volume.
                                     
                         Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell. 
                         Stew nods approval. Smythe begins yelling 
                         and shouting in earnest.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, that's enough. I just wanted you 
                         to get the idea. Now you know. This 
                         house is haunted.

                         No, sir!
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yes. Have you looked in the closets 
                         all over . . .?

                         It's haunted just the same.

                         Smythe has heard enough. He turns to 
                         leave, but Stew grabs him.

                         Smythe, what do you do with yourself 
                         - I mean, when you're not carrying those 
                         double-strength - what do you do with 
                         yourself?

                         Well, sir, I putter.

                         Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and 
                         want to amuse yourself, then what?

                         I just putter.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to 
                         have a putter to putter?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

                         Well, isn't that nice? You just go right 
                         ahead and putter with your hands. That's 
                         all right. How do you do it?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Well sir, I'll show you.
                                     
                         He demonstrates, touching objects on 
                         a table and blowing dust off a lampshade.

                         That's puttering, sir.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         No! Well, well, well! That's all right, 
                         if you like it. Can anybody do that?

                         Oh no, sir. Some people are natural 
                         putterers. Others can never master it.

                         Oh my. You mean, some people are born 
                         and never will become putterers?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Yes sir.

                         Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know 
                         that you could never be a putterer.

                         How about me? Do you think if I concentrated 
                         and put my whole soul into it, that 
                         some day I might be a putterer?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a 
                         putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.

                         Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, 
                         I wouldn't want to putter. But why? 
                         What makes you think I couldn't be a 
                         good putterer?

                         Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind 
                         must be at ease. A person with a problem 
                         could never be a putterer. For instance, 
                         sir, a fish can putter in water but 
                         not on land because he'd be out of place. 
                         An eagle can putter around a rugged 
                         mountaintop but not in a cage, because 
                         he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, 
                         if you will pardon me, with all due 
                         respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, 
                         you are an eagle in a cage.
                                      
                         STEW

                         Stew rushes off upstairs. Smythe gives 
                         the echo one last try.

                         Yeah. Come on, don't be silly.

                         All right, if you feel like you need 
                         a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You'll 
                         find him at Joe's, no doubt. Yeah. Hank 
                         would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard.

                         Sure you would. I knew I could depend 
                         on you, old pal. Snap it up, will you, 
                         Gallagher?

                         She hangs up, joyful at the prospect 
                         of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself 
                         as she picks up the receiver again.

                         him.

                         some friends.

                         I sort of invited him along to bend 
                         an elbow. You don't mind, do you?

                         Joe appears in the open doorway. Stew 
                         sees him.

                         Come in, Joe. It's all right.

                         Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see 
                         you.
                                      
                         Stew starts to close the door.

                         Just a minute - Johnson's outside. You 
                         don't mind if he comes in and dips a 
                         beak[17] do you?

                         Come on in!
                                     
                         Johnson appears in the open doorway. 
                         Stew sees him.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Hello, Johnson.
                                     
                         JOHNSON
                                     
                         Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you?

                         Glad to see you. Come in, kid.
                                     
                         Stew starts to close the door.
                                     
                         JOHNSON
                                     
                         Wait a minute. I got two of the boys 
                         I brought along - they were cruising 
                         around with nothing to do. You don't 
                         mind if I bring them in?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         You brought two of the boys? That's 
                         all right. Bring them in. What's the 
                         difference?
                                      
                         The two enter, followed in a single 
                         file by 12-14 men and women, all of 
                         whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing 
                         hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares 
                         at them dumbfoundedly.

                         They swarm into the hallway and overflow 
                         into the rooms on either side. The butler 
                         stands aghast at this invasion. Stew 
                         starts to close the door when three 
                         or four more troop in, shouting cheery 
                         greetings. Stew regards them in amazement.

                         The rest of the gang had to get out 
                         the morning edition - but they'll be 
                         down later.

                         It will be lonesome without them.

                         Smythe gulps nervously, as he is dragged 
                         off by the revellers.

                         The gang have taken seriously Stew's 
                         suggestion that they make themselves 
                         at home. They have draped themselves 
                         about the place - a couple are strumming 
                         on the piano and others are inspecting 
                         the room in awe-struck attitudes. Smythe

                         Well, Gallagher, you certainly took 
                         no chances, did you?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank 
                         did the rest.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         I see. Hank brought them all. That's 
                         all right. We'll give them a drink and 
                         throw 'em out. How's that?

                         Okay.

                         (as Smythe passes by, being propelled 
                         by revellers)
                                      
                         Smythe! Give them one drink and throw

                         Bingy pokes his head in the door, wearing 
                         a false beard.

                         Is there a green elephant standing beside 
                         that bwana?

                         No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
                                     
                         Stew rolls up his sleeves, preparatory 
                         to launching a punch.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         (warningly)
                                     
                         Uh-uh.
                                     
                         Bingy dons a pair of glasses, and points 
                         to them meaningfully. He enters, cautiously, 
                         watching Stew warily.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         (striking a pose)
                                     
                         Big Chief Bingy come to white man's 
                         tepee to make friends. Big Chief very 
                         sorry. To show how sorry - will bend 
                         over and let white man kick Big Chief 
                         where sun never shines.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss 
                         this one for the world.
                                      
                         He bends over, and Stew winds up and 
                         delivers a hard kick to his backside. 
                         Bingy straightens stiffly, then removes 
                         a bottle of alcohol from the target 
                         area.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Fire water all right.
                                     
                         (he takes a drink)
                                     
                         Both start laughing.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. 
                         By golly, I'm surely glad to see that 
                         you're not really sore. You know our 
                         racket - after all, news is news.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, sure. That's all right. That was 
                         a great story, Bingy. A great story 
                         - wish I'd printed it.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That 
                         hairy chest story!

                         (indicating Bingy's false beard)
                                     
                         You've raised it up to the chin, I see.

                         Go on in the other room and get yourself 
                         a drink.
                                      
                         Bingy emits a war-whoop and proceeds 
                         into the drawing room, where Smythe 
                         is still being held hostage by the party.

                         You know what I should do with you? 
                         I should sock you right in that funny 
                         little nose.

                         Yes - and I'd love it.

                         head upstairs, the party around them

                         Stew and Gallagher enter. Apparently 
                         they have been talking about Stew's 
                         play on the way upstairs.

                         How far have you gotten?

                         Well, I've just been able to get off 
                         that Norway coast - so far.
                                      
                         Stew gestures toward the typewriter 
                         from which a sheet of paper is protruding. 
                         Gallagher crosses to it. She rolls up 
                         the sheet so she can read what is typed 
                         on it.

                         but you're certainly covering a lot 
                         of territory.

                         I don't know a thing about him, but 
                         isn't he the one you're always yelling

                         Stew is noticeably impressed with this

                         Shooting through into the drawing room. 
                         It is many hours later. The members 
                         of the party, including Smythe, are 
                         pretty well lit. On the floor of the 
                         entrance hall a dice game is in progress. 
                         In the drawing room four or five are 
                         hanging over the piano singing "The

                         As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing. 
                         A key is heard in the lock.

                         The outer door starts to swing open. 
                         One of the party guests, very wall-eyed 
                         now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in 
                         his hand, staggers toward the door. 
                         It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler 
                         and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in 
                         the opening. The guest comes up to them.

                         Say, you can't come in here - this is 
                         a private party.
                                      
                         Anne pushes the door violently, which 
                         sends the guest sprawling. He stays 
                         where he lands, holding the bottle in 
                         both arms across his chest. Anne and 
                         her mother advance into a CLOSE SHOT 
                         and look off with incredulous horror

                         He assumes an attitude of exaggerated

                         Smythe, you've been drinking.

                         Very drunk.

                         Where is Mr. Smith?

                         Well, for crying out loud, I don't know. 
                         And I don't care. Whoopee!
                                      
                         He jubilantly exits scene.

                         Very, very drunk.

                         Stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes 
                         him.

                         Now Gallagher, if we could only get 
                         a great scene - a tremendously emotional 
                         scene - some-
                                      
                         ? 87 ?
                                     
                         thing that would just wring the hearts 
                         out of the public - to bring the curtain 
                         down in the second act - that would 
                         be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your 
                         hat some place, could you?

                         Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks 
                         tonight.

                         Now, we've got it right up to where 
                         the boy's wearing his white spats and 
                         going to teas and the frau enters - 
                         how's that?

                         At the partially opened door into the 
                         hall. It opens wider, and Anne looks 
                         in. She stares in horrified amazement.

                         Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled out 
                         on the chaise longue, stretches luxuriously 
                         and yawns. CAMERA PANS TO Stew at the 
                         typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot 
                         and cups prominent, the dressing gown 
                         over the back of his chair. Neither 
                         of them has seen Anne.

                         Anne. She gasps as she quietly steps 
                         further into the room.

                         Gallagher, caught in the midst of a 
                         grand stretch, sits up abruptly, startled. 
                         She stares uncomfortably off at Anne.

                         At the typewriter. He glances up momentarily 
                         and very absently, and goes right on 
                         typing.

                         He types furiously.

                         Stewart looks up surprised at the tone 
                         of her voice.

                         Gallagher, sensing scene, starts hastily 
                         looking for her shoes. One of them has 
                         been shoved under the chaise longue 
                         and she has to get down on her hands 
                         and knees to retrieve it. Anne comes 
                         in and confronts them, her hands on 
                         her hips.

                         Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got 
                         so interested in the play I forgot all 
                         about them.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I see.
                                     
                         ? 88 ?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we 
                         got a play! Of course most of it is 
                         Gallagher's. She did most of it. That 
                         brain of hers just snaps like that all 
                         the time.
                                      
                         He indicates by snapping his fingers. 
                         Gallagher quietly gathers up her things, 
                         apprehensive of the storm about to break.
 
                                                              
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (coldly)
                                     
                         I'm not interested in the way her brain 
                         snaps.
                                      
                         Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her 
                         hat in her hand, her coat over her arm, 
                         starts for the door.

                         I think I better go, Stew.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I think you should, Miss Gallagher.

                         Wait a minute, Gallagher.
                                     
                         Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new 
                         tone in his voice. He comes over to 
                         Anne.

                         STEW
                                     
                         What's the idea, Anne?
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         The idea is simply this - that I want 
                         those people to leave here immediately.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait a minute. Aren't you being 
                         a little unreasonable?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Unreasonable! Have you any idea what 
                         the place looks like downstairs? Do 
                         you expect me to stand here and see 
                         this place turned into a cheap barroom?
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's 
                         no reason for that. Perhaps the boys 
                         have had a little too much to drink. 
                         That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go 
                         right down and throw them out. That's 
                         no reason for you to take this attitude. 
                         After all, I certainly have a right 
                         to invite a few of my friends to my 
                         house, haven't I?

                         you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, 
                         there. That's what I call getting me 
                         told, isn't it, Anne?

                         This is something I should have done 
                         a long time ago, only I didn't have 
                         sense enough to do it. No, I had to 
                         stick around here to try and make a 
                         success of something that I knew darn 
                         well was a failure from the very beginning. 
                         But no more. No more! So that's that.

                         Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he 
                         regards the bum intently.

                         Stew raises one foot, then the other, 
                         and quickly removes the solid gold garters 
                         which he presses into the bum's surprised 
                         hand.

                         Just a minute.

                         He walks away, leaving the bum staring 
                         dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters.

                         and go down the street, arm in arm. 
                         As they get past the Camera, Stew is 
                         seen to square his shoulders and throw 
                         out his chest. He shakes first one leg, 
                         and then the other, as if he were throwing 
                         off shackles.

                         Stew and Gallagher moving along. Gallagher 
                         has a peculiar expression as she glances 
                         at Stew. She has been deeply affected 
                         by the scene she has just witnessed. 
                         Stew's face is very thoughtful.

                         I wouldn't worry too much about it, 
                         Stew. She'll see it your way.

                         (snapping out of it)
                                     
                         Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm 
                         worrying about that second act curtain, 
                         that's all.
                                      
                         Gallagher stares at him, realizing he 
                         is thinking more about the play than 
                         his split-up with his wife. Then she 
                         breaks into a grin.

                         Why, you're just a first-class chump! 
                         You just staged a scene that would play 
                         like a million dollars! How about that 
                         declaration of independence for the 
                         second act curtain?
                                      
                         Stew stops stock still and stares at 
                         her.

                         That's an idea, Gallagher - a great 
                         idea.
                                      
                         Gallagher happily links her arm in his

                         in his shirtsleeves. A battered old 
                         typewriter stands on the table with 
                         a sheet of blank paper in it. Stew is 
                         seated in a chair before it, and is 
                         picking out the letters, typing. He 
                         pauses, running up the roller to regard 
                         what he has written.

                         Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying 
                         some ham and eggs. She looks up as she 
                         sees Stew from the doorway.

                         Surely, sit down. If I had known you 
                         were coming, I would have thrown you 
                         up a waffle.

                         Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand

                         and waits silently for Grayson to speak. 
                         Grayson clears his throat.

                         Anne asked me to come and see you about 
                         the divorce.

                         75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have 
                         any part of that she wants, but she'd 
                         better hurry because I'm spending it 
                         awfully fast.

                         Stew starts advancing nervously toward

                         Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit

                         any of her dough now. I was too poor

                         breaks into a broad grin. He sits down

                         to see the kid, see - to talk over the 
                         divorce. Then this guy insults the poor 
                         but honest boy by offering him alimony 
                         - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer 
                         in the nose and throws him out. How's 
                         that for the beginning of the third 
                         act, huh?

                         Well, from now on the play will be easy. 
                         All you have to do is bring the wife 
                         back, have her say she's sorry, and 
                         then your play's over.

                         He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar 
                         expression.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (vehemently - as he scoops out some 
                         melon)
                                      
                         What's the matter? Do you think I'm 
                         going to let that guy go back to his 
                         wife? Not on your life. He's got to 
                         go to the other girl.

                         She almost drops her coffee cup in a 
                         wild gleam of hope as she looks back 
                         at him. Gallagher tries hard to keep 
                         her voice steady.

                         What other girl—?

                         The little O'Brien girl, of course - 
                         the one you suggested in the story.

                         (ecstatic, but still fighting)
                                     
                         But that's ridiculous! You can't make 
                         a sudden change like that.

                         Gallagher, what are you going to do 
                         - tell me how to write a play?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         No.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         There's nothing sudden about that—
 
                                                              
                         (tensely)
                                     
                         He's always loved the girl, but he was 
                         such a sap he didn't have sense enough 
                         to tell her. Well, that's all right 
                         - we can fix that. He will
                                      
                         ? 97 ?
                                     
                         go to the little O'Brien girl, and - 
                         here, I'll show you.
                                      
                         He gets to his feet, and comes around 
                         to her.

                         Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         He goes to the little O'Brien gal and 
                         he says to her - in some pretty words 
                         of some kind - something that you can 
                         write - he'll say—
                                      
                         (as if reading part - very emotional)
 
                                                              
                         Darling, I'm sorry. I've been a fool 
                         all my life. I've always loved you, 
                         only I didn't have sense enough to see 
                         it. As quick as I can get a divorce 
                         from my wife, I want you to marry me. 
                         Then she'll look at him that way - yeah 
                         - then they'll embrace, or something 
                         like that.
                                      
                         (they draw closer)
                                     
                         Then he'll kiss her, or something.
 
                                                              
                         To demonstrate the point, Stew takes 
                         her in his arms and kisses her. They 
                         hold the kiss longer than is justified. 
                         Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion 
                         and clings to her desperately, while 
                         Gallagher's arms instinctively go around 
                         his neck.
                                      
                         Gallagher chokes back tears that persist 
                         in coming. She stifles a sob. Stew folds 
                         her in his arms.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         What's the matter, Gallagher? What's 
                         the matter?
                                      
                         Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders.
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.
                                     
                         THE END
