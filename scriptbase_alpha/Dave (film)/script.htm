 1   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

     It sits like a jewel off in the distance -- all glittering 
     and white.  The deep blue of the Potomac stands out against 
     the monuments as the sound of a HELICOPTER plays O.s..

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

 2   EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - DAY

     The most famous helicopter in the world lumbers toward the 
     most famous house.  Scores of reporters are camped out on 
     the lawn while the huge machine descends like a hurricane...

     CLOSER - HELICOPTER

     It touches down as the Marine Corps color guard snaps to 
     attention.  The hatch POPS open and a staircase emerges...

 3   FULL SHOT - DOORWAY

     After a moment, PRESIDENT WILLIAM HARRISON MITCHELL appears, 
     accompanied by his wife ELLEN and loyal dog Cupcakes.  They 
     smile from the landing and wave to the world -- a postcard 
     of themselves.

     TRACKING SHOT - FIRST FAMILY

     "HAIL TO THE CHIEF" RINGS OUT across the grounds.  Formidably 
     handsome Bill Mitchell is fit and in his early forties. 

     His wife Ellen, still in her early thirties, is considered a 
     classical beauty with a wide "friendly" smile that in certain 
     photographs seems just on the edge of wistful.  The dog 
     frolics around them as they wave to the press and smile for 
     the world.

     Ozzie and Harriet for the Nineties with a bow to FDR and 
     some Camelot thrown in.

     MOVING WITH them...

     They stride arm in arm beneath the portico that leads to the 
     West Wing.  The band is still playing as they head under the 
     archway, disappearing from public view.    Then, instantly, 
     as a handler rushes up and grabs the dog,  the smiles vanish.

     Bill lets go of Ellen and Ellen lets go of Bill.   He turns 
     to his right and she turns to her left.

     Off they go in their separate directions.

                                                          CUT TO:

 4   INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

     The President strides down the long marble hallway flanked 
     by his two senior advisors, BOB ALEXANDER, the White House 
     Chief of Staff and ALAN REED, the White House Media Advisor.

                           MITCHELL
               Is everybody in there?

                           BOB
               They're waiting for you.  And they're 
               very nervous.

                                                          CUT TO:

 5   INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

     It is the seat of power.  There is a dark oak conference 
     table with a crystal chandelier above it.   Alan Reed is 
     reading from a notebook full of polling data while the 
     President glares at a group of congressional leaders.  Bob 
     glares at them, too, while they cower behind their water 
     glasses.

                           REED
                    (reading from his 
                    notebook)
               I wish I had better news... Our 
               compassion index is off seven points 
               from the last sample and that's down 
               eighteen on the year.  The `Cares 
               About People Like Me' numbers are 
               really in the toilet.  We're off 
               twenty points from March and that 
               was right after we raised interest 
               rates...

                           MITCHELL
               Dammit...
                    (beat)
               I told them no mayo.
                    (looking up)
               See - - I could veto this Simpson 
               Garner thing, but I really don't 
               want to do that...

     A couple of the legislators flinch,  still staring straight 
     ahead.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    (circling)
               Do you know why I don't want to do 
               it?

     They all look over at him for a moment.   Mitchell leans out 
     over the table like some great, predatory beast.

                           MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    (strangled whisper)
               ... Because it's got homeless 
               shelters... and Head Start centers 
               ...  and... and...

                           BOB
                    (whispering)
               Hot lunches.

     The President looks back at him for an instant then turns 
     back toward the table.

                           MITCHELL
                    (building)
               ... And hot lunches for little
                    (thundering suddenly)
               And if I kill it... I'll look like a 
               prick.

     They all flinch slightly.

                           MITCHELL (CONT'D)
               And I don't want to look like a prick!
                    (beat)
               I want YOU to look like pricks!!!

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

                           SPEAKER
               Sir, we tried to kill it twice...

                           MITCHELL
                    (whisper again)
               I don't think so, Howard.  If you 
               had killed it -- it would be dead.
                    (looking him in the 
                    eye)
               When I kill something - - it always 
               dies.  Doesn't it, Bob?

                           BOB
                    (steely)
               Always dead.

                           MAJ. LEADER
               Mr. President, with all the work 
               your wife has done with the 
               homeless...

     The President turns and stares daggers at him.   The man 
     starts to flumph as Mitchell cuts him off.

                           MITCHELL
               Norman, I don't want you to do this 
               cause you're forced to...
                    (beat)
               I want you to do this because you 
               want to.  I want you to do it because 
               you think it's the right thing to 
               do.  I want you to do it because 
               you're acting in the best interests 
               of our country...

     They stare back at him stupefied.

                           BOB
                    (upbeat)
               Well -- I think that's it.

                                                          CUT TO:

 6   INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - LATER

     He moves down the corridor toward the Oval Office with Bob 
     and Reed at his side.

     A long line of secretaries flanks the entrance.

                           BOB
               ... You've got that radio address to 
               go over and the American Bar 
               Association at the Monroe tomorrow 
               night...

     The President pauses at one of the desks and fixes a stare.at 
     one of the secretaries,  (RANDI).  She looks up from behind 
     a pair of clear-pane glasses,  and blushes at him effectively.

                           MITCHELL
                    (smiling at Randi)
               The Monroe?

                           REED
               Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...

     Randi smiles back at him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           MITCHELL
                    (whispering to Reed)
               Did you get someone to double for me 
               there, out front?

                           REED
               We're working on it.

                           MITCHELL
                    (still under his breath)
               Try to find someone who looks like 
               me this time.  That last guy was a 
               joke.

                           REED
               We're doing our best, sir.

     He nods and winks at Randi again before heading inside the 
     Oval Office.   The President starts humming "Hail to the 
     Chief" quietly to himself...

                                                          CUT TO:

 7   EXT. DURENBURGER'S CHRYSLER PLYMOUTH - DAY

     Red, white and blue flags fly above the used cars to announce 
     Durenberger's grand opening.  A SCRATCHY RENDITION of "HAIL 
     TO THE CHIEF" PLAYS from a makeshift P.A. SYSTEM and a little 
     stage has been erected in front of the cars.  DURENBURGER 
     himself stands alone at the mike.

                           DURENBURGER
               This is a real special moment here 
               at Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth... 
               Ladies an' gentlemen, I wantcha to 
               give a real warm welcome to...
                    (pause)
               The President of the United

     WIDER

     A dead-ringer for the President appears, perched on the back 
     of a four hundred pound pig.   He is DAVE KOVIC, our hero.   
     Dave enters from "stage right" wearing an Uncle Sam hat and 
     waving triumphantly to the crowd.   A teenage boy pulls the 
     pig forward by a rope.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     He makes the victory sign with both hands and dismounts the 
     PIG who lets out a SNORT.  Dave bounds up to the small 
     platform where he is greeted warmly by Durenburger.  Dave 
     hands him a small stack of 3x5 filing cards while "HAIL TO 
     THE CHIEF" CONCLUDES its final strains.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Dave salutes the crowd.

                           DAVE
                    (doing a decent Bill 
                    Mitchell)
               Thank you, Don.  Thank you for that 
               warm introduction.
                    (pause)
               You know it's wonderful to be here 
               today amongst so many smiling faces.

     REVERSE ANGLE - CROWD

     Eight to ten people stand stonefaced amongst the Plymouth 
     Horizons.

     ON DAVE

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               And, Don, let me assure you from one 
               chief executive to another, that 
               there's no Chrysler Plymouth like 
               Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth.

     A few employees applaud.   Dave nudges Durenburger who takes 
     out one of the cards.

                           DURENBURGER
                    (reading/monotone)
               Thank you, Mr. President.  It 
               certainly is nice of you to be with 
               us here today considering your busy 
               schedule and all.

                           DAVE
               Well, Don -- it's true that I have a 
               busy schedule.  But I've got a feeling 
               that when folks find out about your 
               five hundred dollar cash rebate on 
               all `93 LeBaron and LeBaron 
               convertibles you're gonna be even 
               busier than I am.

     Dave looks toward the crowd for another reaction but nothing 
     comes back.  An eight-year-old GIRL tugs at the bottom of 
     her MOTHER's dress.

                           GIRL
               Mommy, is that the President?

                           MOTHER
                    (shaking her head)
               I sure hope not.

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He leans closer to Durenburger continuing with the routine.

                           DAVE
               You know, Don, it's not easy being 
               President.  Why just the other day, 
               I was riding on Air Force One...

     The PIG lets out a HUGE SNORT causing everyone to jump with 
     a start.   A six-year-old KID starts to CRY while Dave glances 
     down toward the front row.

     ANGLE-DAVE

     He stops the routine and squints out toward the crowd while 
     the WAILING CONTINUES.  His parents try to comfort the BOY 
     but it doesn't do any good.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Hey, hey... What's the matter...

     DIFFERENT ANGLE - DAVE

     He dismounts the stage and stumbles on one of the steps.

     Dave puts on the glasses that he normally wears and squats 
     face to face with the six-year-old.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (gently)
               Hi...
                    (beat)
               What's your name?

     The child doesn't respond at first.   Dave moves a little 
     closer to the boy.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Don't you have a name?

                           CHILD (KID)
                    (sniffling)
               ... Sam.

                           DAVE
                    (soothingly)
               Hi, Sam... You want a riddle?

     The Kid thinks for a second then nods.   He wipes some stuff 
     off his nose.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Okay.  What can run all day without 
               getting tired?

     The Kid ponders it for a moment.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (leaning closer)
               Well come on, Sam.   It's not your 
               ear...

     Dave touches the Kid's ear as his eyes suddenly light up.

                           SAM (KID)
               My nose?

                           DAVE
               Right!!!

     Dave reaches up and "magically" produces a quarter from the 
     side of the child's nose.  He beams with delight as Dave 
     hands him the coin.

 8   EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY

     Dave hurries down the busy sidewalk clutching a beat-up 
     briefcase and his Uncle Sam hat.  In civilian clothes, with 
     his tousled hair, no one even notices that he looks like the 
     President.  Dave ducks into a small storefront office with a 
     simple sign above it:

     "KOVIC TEMPS"

     "Like we've been there forever"

 9   INT. DAVE'S OFFICE

     The place is small and cluttered and very well lived in.

     Dave's secretary and ex-wife, ALICE, is kissing her boyfriend 
     JERRY goodbye.

                           JERRY
               Six-thirty?

                           ALICE
               Perfect.

                           JERRY
               Great, I'll see you then.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     He blows her another kiss and turns to the door just as Dave 
     bounds into the room.

                           JERRY (CONT'D)
               Hi, Dave.

                           DAVE
                    (buoyant)
               Hi...

     He hangs up his coat and turns to Alice as Jerry leaves the 
     room.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (hanging up his coat)
               It went great, Alice.   I killed em 
               down there.

                           ALICE
               Yeah?  Why don't you see what You 
               can do in here.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Dave turns around to see three women stacked up in his waiting 
     area.

                           DAVE
                    (renewed energy)
               No problem.  What`ve we got?

                           ALICE
                    (rattling it off)
               Mabel says it's too far on the bus.  
               Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her 
               again and Lola's been crying in your 
               office for an hour.

     Dave sticks his head inside his office where a Hispanic WOMAN 
     of about fifty is crying into a tiny lace handkerchief.

               It's alright.  We'll find you 
               something else.

     He darts back out.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I'll get her something right now.

               E -- X...

     He nods earnestly accepting it for what must be the hundredth 
     time.  Alice sighs and motions toward his desk.

                           ALICE (CONT'D)
               Bottom drawer next to your baseball 
               glove.

               Thanks.  You're the best.

11   INT. ACCOUNTANCY OFFICE OF "MURRAY BLUM,  CPA" - DAY

     Dave's best friend MURRAY stands in front of Dave and Lola.

     In the b.g. sit four or five women without much to do in 
     particular.

                           MURRAY
               Dave, I can't hire anybody else.

     He turns toward his desk.  Dave follows him down the aisle.

                    ("confidentially")

     She starts to whimper all over again while Dave looks 
     plaintively at Murray.

                           DAVE
               Short-term thing.   Straight temp

     Dave flashes him a big smile and breathes a sigh of relief.

               So you want to go swimming?

               Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow 
               then.

     Murray nods as Dave turns humming into the hallway.

     It is dark and a little cluttered.   A low GUTTURAL NOTE 
     starts to build as it ECHOES up the stairwell.

               `Where the wavin' wheat, can sure 
               smell sweet...'

     He sets down his keys, crosses to the kitchen.  Dave yanks 
     open the fridge, pulls out a beer, pops open the top, hits a 
     twenty foot hook shot with the bottle cap, then crosses to 
     the living room...

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               'and the wind comes right behind the -

     He looks across the room and suddenly freezes.

     DAVE'S POV

     Three large men are seated on his living room couch.

     The black one in the middle (DUANE STEVENSEN) speaks first.

                           DUANE
               Mr. Kovic?

     BACK TO SCENE

     Dave freezes and shakes his head.

                           DUANE (CONT'D)
               I'm Duane Stavensen with the United 
               States Secret Service.

     Dave's eyes go a little wider.

                           DUANE (CONT'D)
               We're with the federal government.

     He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a gleaming 
     silver badge.  Dave looks at it.   Terrified.

                           DAVE
               Oh my God...  I thought it was a 
               legitimate deduction, I swear to

                           DUANE
               No.

     Dave's stopped and just stares at him.  Duane leans forward 
     on the couch.

                           DUANE (CONT'D)
               Your government needs your help.

15   INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Dave is sitting on the edge of the bed, getting his hair 
     trimmed by JOHNNY, the Presidential makeup man and traveling 
     barber.  He removes the apron and stands back to admire his 
     handiwork.

     At that moment the door swings open and Bob Alexander. the

     Five hundred people have gathered at a thousand dollars a

     seal of the President in front.

                           MITCHELL
               You know as I was coming in here 
               tonight I ran into Jordan Blankfort 
               who I hadn't seen for years...

     The President smiles down at Jordan while the CAMERA begins 
     a LONG,  SLOW DOLLY AROUND the back of the podium.

                           MITCHELL (CONT'D)
               And I couldn'thelp remembering back

               students, we liked to enjoy a few 
               beers on occasion...

     The CAMERA CONTINUES its DOLLY REVEALING the clear glass

18   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Dave stands alone,  trying to put on his tuxedo while he 
     stares at a television monitor.   He squints at himself for 
     a second, then lifts the arm of the tuxedo in a "Presidential" 
     wave.

     He immediately lowers it and tries it with the other one, 
     duplicating the President's movements exactly.   The door 
     opens behind him.

                           DUANE
               Get readY.

     Dave turns and nods emphatically.    He glances back at the 
     TV monitor where President Mitchell is receiving a standing 
     ovation.

                           MITCHELL (V.O.)

20   INT. BALLROOM

     The audience has risen to its feet.  Bill Mitchell stands at 
     the podium waving out to the crowd like a conquering hero.

     He turns and salutes a crimson-robed cleric who is standing 
     by his side.  The priest salutes the President and lifts his 
     arms like a prizefighter.  The applause is still going strong 
     as Mitchell leaves the stage.

21   INT. HALLWAY

23   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

     The Presidential entourage steps out of the elevator and 
     moves' rapidly down phe hall.  It looks like a solid wall of 
     business suits with three tuxedos in front.  They reach the 
     door of the suite together...

24   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

     The door to the suite swings suddenly open.   Three Secret 
     Service enter the room,  followed by the President a moment 
     later.   Dave snaps to attention with his arms at his sides 
     when the President looks up and suddenly stops:

     PRESIDENT'S POV - REVERSE ANGLE

     Dave stands in front of him with slicked back hair and a 
     crisp new tuxedo.   It is a mirror image of the President 
     himself.

     Dave stands frozen for a moment then breaks into a nervous 
     smile...

     WIDER ANGLE

     The President stares at him carefully.

                           MITCHELL (CONT'D)
               You are a very handsome man.

               Just get rid of that grin.  You look 
               like a schmuck.

     Dave immediately wipes off the smile as the President moves 
     past him and disappears into another room.

     He stares in wonder at the President's wake.  The rest of 
     the crowd moves out of the living room as Duane clears his 
     throat and motions to the door.    It's show time.

26   INT. FOYER

     The entourage has grown to a Presidential level as Dave 
     emerges `from the elevator and heads toward the door.   He 
     pauses for a moment to catch his breath while the Secret 
     Service race ahead toward the entrance.

27   EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE

     A large cheer erupts from the crowd as Dave appears at the 
     top of the steps.    There is a virtual explosion of shutters 
     and a bank of TV lights glares in his face.  Dave freezes 
     for a moment then remembers and lifts his arm in "The 
     Presidential Wave."    A louder cheer goes up from the crowd 
     as Duane races ahead to the limo beyond.

     CLOSER ON DAVE

     He starts to smile and heads down the steps as the crowd 
     presses up to the limit of the barricades.

     ANGLE - LIMOUSINE

     Duane stands at the open door when Dave stops again and waves 
     once more.   A LOUDER CHEER goes up this time.  The FANS 
     keep SCREAMING and Dave can no longer control him- self.  
     Suddenly and without warning, he hops up on the running board 
     of the car.

                           DAVE
                    (waving to the crowd)
               Hello America!  God Bless you!

     A huge CHEER goes up from the throng as he dismounts.  Duane 
     grabs him by the collar and pulls him into the limo...

     The car turns right into the driveway of the White House.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Holy shit.

36   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dave sits frozen in an armchair across from the President's 
     desk.  There are twenty-foot windows that lead out to the 
     Rose Garden and two huge flags on either side of the desk.

     Alan Reed leans nonchalantly on one of the chairs.    Bob 
     stands nearby.

                           REED
                    (all schmooz)
               Dave, my name is Alan Reed.  I'm the 
               White House Communications Director.  
               This is Bob Alexander, our Chief of 
               Staff.
                    (smiling)
               We met you earlier tonight at the 
               hotel, remember?

     Dave nods, frozen in his chair.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               Can I get you something to drink?

     He shakes his head.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or 
               something?

                           DAVE
                    (still frozen)
               Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

     Reed flashes him a smile and glances over at Bob.

                           REED
                    (moving toward him)
               Now, Dave, something has come up and 
               I think we need to talk about it...

                           DAVE
                    (blurting it out)
               Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said 
               not to talk, but when I saw the crowd 
               I just got excited...

                           REED
               We're not upset with you, Dave.  We 
               think you did a terrific job.
                    (to Bob)
               Don't we?

                           BOB
                    (all tension)
               Terrific.

     Reed smiles at Dave, who musters a little smile in return.

                           REED
               In fact, we think you did such a 
               good job, we'd like to extend things 
               a little bit.

                           DAVE
               Extend things?

                           REED
                    (nodding)
               Extend them.
                    (beat)
               C'mere for a second.

     He places a hand on Dave's shoulder and motions toward the 
     desk.  Dave hesitates,  then follows him over.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Reed pulls out the President's chair and motions to it.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               Try it out.

     Dave looks down at the chair in wonder.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               Go ahead.

     Dave pauses for a moment then sinks down into the soft brown 
     leather.   He stares out in awe across the Oval Office.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Reed looks over at Bob, who nods at him.  He takes a deep 
     breath.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               Dave, something has happened to the 
               President.

                           DAVE
                    (whirling)
               Oh my God...

                           REED
                    (soothing him)
               I know...  I know...
                    (pause)
               It's difficult for all of us.  But 
               sometimes we have to put our personal 
               feelings aside and focus on the good 
               of the country.

               What happened?

               Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an 
               'incident'  really...

                           BOB
                    (nodding)
               A condition...

                           REED
               Exactly. A condition.

     Dave nods but still doesn't understand.   Reed hesitates 
     when Bob glares at him again.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               It's actually kind of serious, Dave.  
               I'm afraid the President's not in 
               very good shape.

                           DAVE
                    (actually shaken)
               Oh my gosh...

     He sits there,  stunned for a moment.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Will he be alright?

                           REED
               Oh, yeah... probably...

                           BOB
               We think so.

                           REED
               Yes.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               Oh.

     Reed moves closer.

                           REED
               Dave, we need our friends and even 
               our enemies to feel safe and secure...  
               We need them to feel like they can 
               go to bed at night knowing President 
               Mitchell is fully in control... We

               right here in this chair...

     Bob and Reed just stare at him.   Dave nods,  then suddenly 
     jumps out of the chair.

                           DAVE
               Hey - - wait a second...

     He stares at them for a beat...

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               What about the Vice President?

                    (panicked)
               Vice President?

                           BOB
               Well... We didn't want to have to 
               get into this but...
                    (deadly serious)
               ... The Vice President is mentally 
               unbalanced.

     Reed's eyes go wide.  Bob stares straight ahead.

                           DAVE
                    (stunned)
               No.

               Really?   Crazy?

                           BOB
               Certifiable.

     Dave looks at them amazed.  Bob moves closer to the desk.

                           BOB (CONT'D)
               How much do you usually get paid?

                           DAVE
                    (lost...)
               Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's 
               just like a barter thing...  Is this 
               legal?

     Reed stops and looks at Bob for a moment.    He turns back 
     to Dave.

                           REED
                    (evenly)
               Dave - - have you ever driven through 
               a red light?

     Dave stares at him.

                           REED (CONT'D)
               You know, on an empty road where you 
               know it's safe and nobody's around...

                           DAVE
               I'm not sure... I might have.

                           REED
               Well,  let's say your mother was in 
               the car and you had to get her to a 
               hospital.  You'd do it then for sure 
               wouldn't you?

                           DAVE
               Well... I gues I would... Yeah.

                           REED
                    (beat)
               Now,  let's say the whole country.
               Was in that car.  The entire United 
               States of America.

                           DAVE
               In the car?

               In the car.

               I see what you mean.

     Reed smiles at him and rests a gentle hand on his shoulder.

               Dave,  the country is sick.  And 
               we're gonna get it to a hospital.

37   INT. THIRD FLOOR RESIDENCE - NIGHT

     A pair of gilt-edged doors swing open to reveal a massive 
     bedroom beyond.   It is fifty-feet long and twenty-feet wide.

     Brocaded draperies hang from the windows and a four-poster 
     bed stretches to the ceiling.

                           BOB
               These are the living quarters.  The 
               President's bedroom is on this side 
               and the First Lady's is over there.

               spokesmen say the President's

39   INT. BOB'S OFFICE - DAWN

     The first rays of sunrise are breaking through the window.

     Reed Sits on the couch holding a large rubber ice bag while 
     Bob paces across the rug.

                           REED
               Do you know how many different kinds

                    (turning)
               It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice 
               President to Africa or something, 
               dig up some dirt on him, force him 
               to resign and get our 'President' to 
               nominate a new one.  The whole thing

     Reed heaves a sigh and looks at his notes.

               I got the nurses for fifty grand a 
               piece and the doctors for a hundred.  
               The older one wanted head of the

               Duane's guys, but he's got them under 
               control.

               What about her.

               Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...
                    (beat)
               She was giving that commencement

               to catch her before she left the

     Dave sits up on the examining table with his shirt off.  
     Bob, Reed and three other vascular specialists watch 
     attentively while the President's personal physician puts a 
     stethoscope to his chest.

                           DOCTOR
                    (lowering it)
               Well, I must say, Mr. President, 
               even for a man with a mild stroke 
               you seem to have made a remarkable 
               recovery.

                           DAVE
                    (happy as a clam)
               Thanks.  I'm feeling much better.

     Reed smiles like a proud father.

                    (glancing at his chart)
               No signs of paralysis, no circulatory 
               changes.  Your E.M.G. is completely 
               normal and your blood pressure has 
               even gone down.

     Bob shoots him a look.

41   INT.  PRESIDENT'S OUTER OFFICE - LITTLE LATER

     Dave moves through the outer office flanked by Bob and Reed.

     He wears a blue Presidential jogging suit with a little gold 
     seal embroidered on the chest.  Dave approaches a line of 
     SECRETARIES standing behind their desks.

               Don't worry.

     He bangs into the side of a credenza. Bob and Reed freeze as 
     Dave gathers himself then keeps going.

     Bob and Reed take him by the shoulders and move him inside...

     He is still staring at the doorway as they close the door to

               She's just a little emotional -- she 
               feels kind of attached to the 
               President.

     Dave nods as they deposit him in the President's chair.  
     Reed slides the phone in front of him.

               Okay, let's go over it again. You

                    (first time he's heard 
                    the voice)
               You know that's very good.

     ... while Dave turns to them with a smile.

                           DAVE
               Oh, I loved that speech.

     Dave brings his hand to his forehead, scanning an imaginary 
     horizon.

                           REED
               Thanks, I wrote it.

               It's in the little leaguer who may 
               strike out but knows in his heart 
               that at least swung...

               the family kitchen as we gather 
               together when the sun goes down...'

     He exhales deeply and lowers his head almost tearfully.  Bob 
     and Reed look at him stunned as he comes out of the reverie 
     and turns to face them.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (upbeat)
               So when do we start?

                                                          CUT TO:

52   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - CLOSEUP - ANDREA MITCHELL -

     She continues with her report speaking directly INTO the 
     CAMERA:

                           ANDREA MITCHELL
               Tom, virtually every reporter in 
               Washington is camped out here awaiting 
               the President's first appearance 
               since his stroke...

     WIDENING OUT:

     Andrea Mitchell stands camped on the White House lawn amidst 
     a small army of minicams, trucks and reporters.

     They all seemed focused on the Truman Balcony.

                           ANDREA MITCHELL (CONT'D)
               Even though some may find his recovery 
               amazing, White House officials claim 
               they never expected less from a man 
               who always expects so much from 
               himself.

53   INT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM - DAY

     Dave stands, in his new blue suit, peeking out the window at 
     the circus below.

                           DAVE
                    (turning back)
               I thought you said I wasn't going to 
               see her.

                           REED
               It's just five minutes.  She comes 
               in.  You wave to the press.  She 
               leaves.

                           DAVE
               Yeah, but the First Lady...

     Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?

                           REED
               She hardly ever sees him and it'll 
               be so fast, she won't have a chance 
               to tell.

                           BOB
               Be a professional. If you can convince 
               her -- you can convince anybody.

                           DAVE
                    (reluctantly)
               ... Alright.

                           BOB
               Now when she comes in, we'll move 
               you right out to the balcony.  All 
               you have to say is  `thanks for doing 
               this, Ellen.'

                           DAVE
               `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

                           REED
               Exactly.
                    (lowering his voice)
               She doesn't always like this stuff 
               and it might soften her up.

     Dave continues practicing "Thanks..."

                           BOB
                    (hitting the intercom)
               We're ready.

     Bob rises from the couch and crosses to the doorway at the 
     far corner of the room.  Reed leads Dave to the large double 
     doors that open onto the balcony itself.

     CLOSEUP - DAVE

     He jiggles nervously for a moment.  Dave takes a large wad 
     of gum from his mouth and sticks it quickly under the mantel 
     piece...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           WOMAN (O.S.)
               Why can't you die from a stroke like 
               everybody else?

     DAVE'S POV - DOOR

     He turns to see Ellen Mitchell, glaring at him from the 
     doorway.  Everyone in the room freezes.

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He is stunned by her beauty. Dave just stares at her as she 
     crosses the room.

                           ELLEN
                    (to Dave)
               What are you staring at?

                           DAVE
                    (too stunned to talk)
               Uh...

                           REED
                    (jumping in)
               We're gonna do it right out here.

     She stops just before the window, then turns back to look 
     Dave in the eye.

                           ELLEN
               Who was it, Bill? A Secretary?

     He has nothing to say and just stares at her.  Reed nudges 
     him a little.

                           DAVE
               Thanks for doing this, Ellen.

                           ELLEN
               Go fuck yourself, Bill.

                           BOB
               Well, perhaps we can get started 
               now.

     She moves directly onto the balcony, leaving Dave behind.  
     He stands there dumbfounded, as Reed takes him by the arm, 
     and gently pushes him out after her.

54   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY

     Dave stumbles out and finds Ellen, already poised at the 
     rail waving to the crowd.

     CLOSER.

                           ELLEN
                    (in a whisper)
               And you can tell those two pit vipers 
               this is the last one of these I'll 
               be doing for a while.

     She takes his hand, displaying it publicly.  Dave looks down 
     at his hand in hers.  The heat of her skin goes right to his 
     brain.

                           REED (O.S.)
                    (loud whisper)
               Smile!

     Dave smiles.

                           REED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    (louder whisper)
               Wave!

     Dave waves.

     WIDER.   INCLUDING reporters.

                           REPORTER #1
               How do you feel, Mr. President?

     YELLOW ROOM

     Bob and Reed are huddled beside the window.

                           REED
                    (stage whisper)
               Fine.

               Fine.

               I'm outta here.

     She drops his hand, turns and goes back through the door 
     leaving Dave alone on the balcony.  He stands there for a 
     moment, then turns and follows her inside.

55   INT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM - DAY

     She is halfway across the room when Ellen suddenly stops and 
     does a one-eighty in the middle of the carpet.

                           ELLEN
               Don't you have anything to say to 
               me?

     her.

     All the reporters have gone home and the only remnants are 
     scattered pieces of trash that blow across the lawn.

57   INT. WRITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Duane sits poised in his chair, just outside Dave's door.  
     He sleeps soundly, when the door opens a crack behind him.

58   INT. WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR - NIGHT

     It is cavernous and huge -- the size of small garage.  Dave

     shivers slightly behind him.

               You gotta try this.  It's my special

     meat.

               So, how long have they been like

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               So you just protect the President 
               the whole time?   That's your whole

               I understand.

     Dave turns back to the sandwich while Duane looks at him for 
     a moment.  Duane rolls his eyes and unbuttons the front of 
     his coat revealing a fifteen round Beretta.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (looking at the gun)

               What about it?

                           DAVE
               Well, is that really true? I mean, 
               would you really get killed just to 
               save his life.

                           DUANE
               Certainly.

     Dave cuts the sandwich in half turning back to Duane.

                           DAVE
               So that means, now you'd get killed 
               for me too?

     Duane looks at him, stunned by the realization.  Dave smiles 
     and moves forward, extending the sandwich.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Here.  Try this.

     Duane stares at it for a moment, then lifts the sandwich in 
     a daze.

     It's a Washington mecca for the power lunch.  Bob and Reed 
     Sit in a corner booth with a manilla folder between them.

               I mean I've checked everything.  
               Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went 
               all the way back to his high school

               The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He 
               declared frequent flyer miles on his 
               income tax return.

     Reed twists in his chair while Bob checks out the dossier.

               What about the wife?

                           BOB
               Nobody's got clean kids.

                           REED
               We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't 
               work.

                           BOB
               If we find nothing, we get creative.  
               Just make something up.  Instead of 
               a couple weeks it'll be a couple of 
               months.  The whole thing is under 
               control.

                           REED
                    (leaning forward; 
                    tense whisper)
               You think we can keep this thing 
               going for a couple of months!

     At that moment, a DISTINGUISHED MAN moves up the table, 
     clapping a hand on Reed's shoulder.

                           DISTINGUISHED MAN
                    (strong Southern accent)
               Bob... Alan... Your boy sure looks 
               great.
                    (leaning closer)
               I think he sounds even better'n he 
               did before this stroke.

     He lets out a rich, throaty laugh, full of booze and 
     cigarettes.   Bob smiles at him.

64   INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

     Dave is escorted through the plant by the GM PRESIDENT and a 
     large entourage.  Bob and Reed hover a couple of steps behind 
     as Dave listens to the tour.

                           GM PRESIDENT
               Now this man is using a robotic 
               mechanism for picking up the engine.  
               The large arms that you see duplicate 
               all of his arm movements exactly, so 
               it's as if he's lifting two thousand 
               pounds.

     They pause in front of a large assembly area.  One of the 
     workers stands at a machine with his arms stuck in two long 
     rubber sleeves.  Above him, a pair of mechanical arms hoists 
     an engine high into the air.

               No, no.   It's really quite simple.  
               Just come on over here.

     The GM Executive leads Dave toward the huge machine.  He 
     smiles as an army of cameras press in closer.

               Now, you slip your hands into these 
               sleeves here...

     Dave nods and does as he is told.    All at once the two 12-
     foot arms shoot straight up into the air.  He smiles with 
     delight as the massive robot comes alive in his hands.  Dave 
     lifts his arms over his head and the huge claws point straight 
     toward the ceiling.  He sticks them out to the side and the 
     robot does the same.

                           DAVE
               I once caught a fish this big.

     Dave sticks his arms out to his sides and the huge claws 
     indicate a 40-foot fish.  A roar goes up from the crowd as a 
     slight smile starts to spread across Reed's face...

               Yeah, he looks great 'cause they're

               show at the auto plant was the most 
               manipulative piece of political

                    (pause)
               The President of the United States.

     Dave hops over the little railing that separates his box 
     from the field.  The catcher stands a few feet away giving 
     him a target with the glove, but Dave shakes his head and 
     waves him over to the mound.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     The catcher looks a little baffled as Dave strides across 
     the foul line with a grin on his face. The forty thousand 
     fans start to go wild as he climbs up on the mound, tucking 
     the ball behind his back.

     REVERSE ANGLE - CATCHER

     He stands at the plate sticking out his glove to give Dave a 
     bigger target.    The President looks at him for a second, 
     then motions him into a crouch.

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He spits on the mound and spreads his fingers in a fork- 
     ball grip.   The catcher sinks into a crouch as Dave goes 
     into a wind-up and busts off a perfect curve-ball.  The 
     catcher looks at it astonished as it "breaks" into his mitt.   
     The crowd goes nuts...

               There's something going on here, 
               Larry, and no one is telling us the 
               truth.

               Oliver, the guy had a little stroke.

     doing a split-second tour of the channels.  Dave looks toward 
     the French doors that lead to the fourth floor balcony.

83   EXT. BALUSTRADE - NIGHT

     Dave tosses open the door and steps outside.  He stretches 
     out his limbs, staring at the magnificent view of the city.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     He looks off toward the other side of the White House; Ellen's 
     side.  A single curtain billows out of an open window.  Dave 
     can't help himself.  He starts across the terrace.

     FOLLOWING DAVE

     Dave reaches the open doorway and slides quickly against the 
     wall.   Slowly, carefully he bends his head and peeks into 
     the room.

84   INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - DAVE'S POV

     She sits on her bed, surrounded by some work papers.  In the 
     warm light of the room, through the billowing curtains, 
     Ellen's skin seems to glow.

     She stops reading for a moment and brushes aside a loose 
     strand of hair.

     Dave stares at her, transfixed.   Suddenly, a light comes on

     The long line of black limousines and police motorcycles 
     makes its way through downtown Washington.

88   INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE

     Dave sits next to the First Lady in the back seat of the 
     limo.

     Both of them stare straight ahead.   Finally, after several 
     seconds of silence, Ellen turns to Dave.

               Why are you doing this, Bill?

     He looks over at her, startled.

                           DAVE
               What?

                           ELLEN
                    (irritated)
               Since when do you care about the 
               homeless?

     Dave thinks for a moment.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               I care about the homeless.

                           ELLEN
               Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up 
               nights.

     She turns away from him, twisting in the seat.  The bottom 
     of Ellen's skirt hikes up her thigh, exposing the top part 
     of her leg.  Dave looks down at it, drawn to the sight of 
     naked flesh.  Sensing something, Ellen glances back and 
     catches him looking.

     CLOSER

     Their eyes lock for a moment.  Dave smiles quickly and glances 
     out the window.  Ellen looks down at her own leg a little 
     puzzled.

89   EXT. HELPING HAND SHELTER - DAY

     painted a bright shade of blue - - a cheery little island in 
     a sea of graffiti.

     A small group of community leaders waits by the front door 
     while the Presidential limousine pulls up to the curb.

     CLOSER

     The door pops open as Ellen and Dave step out.  He turns and 
     waves to the crowd while she stares straight ahead.  Reed 
     hurries up to them.

               but there's a great visual in the 
               kitchen so make sure you stop at the 
               soup.

     She shoots him a glare as they reach the top of the stairs.

     Dave nods and they move forward to greet the community 
     leaders.

90   INT.  SHELTER

     He takes a couple of steps inside, then suddenly stops.  The 
     smile fades as his eyes go wide.

     DAVE'S POV

     It is more a nursery school than a homeless shelter.  Twenty 
     to thirty children, most of them black, stand formally 
     assembled in front of the President.

                           ELLEN
                    (good at this)
               One of the things they're trying to 
               do here at Helping Hand, is keep 
               verbal skills alive.  The first thing 
               that goes with these kids is their 
               ability to communicate and they need 
               to get to them before this happens.

     She glances over her shoulder.  Dave has wandered forward to 
     the edge of the large rubber mat.  Everyone stares, stunned, 
     as he looks at the kids for a moment, then sinks suddenly to 
     his knees.

     Everyone freezes.  The camera crews back up a step as Dave 
     turns back toward the kids.

     the middle of the mat.  He leans forward, into the children, 
     talking like a kindergarten teacher.

     He beams from ear to ear as the photo-op materializes in

               Reed fishes through his pockets and

               getting tired.

     The kid looks at him, baffled.  Dave reaches out slowly and 
     taps the side of his nose.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (gently)
               Well, it's not your ear.

                           KID
                    (lighting up)
               My nose?

     ANGLE - ELLEN

     She watches in amazement as her husband reaches out and 
     "magically" produces a quarter from the side of the child's 
     nose.  Dave looks up at her with a smile, and their eyes 
     lock as a hundred shutters fire at once...

                           KOPPEL
               What makes a man rise to a particular 
               moment in history?  What makes a man 
               in the thicket of middle age, suddenly 
               rediscover himself with the wonder 
               of a child.

               Later on tonight, we'll talk with 
               Dr. Henry Mueller who is an expert 
               in the psychological effects of a 
               mid-life health crisis... and to 
               Gail Sheehy, who has just co-authored 
               a book on male menopause.

92   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

     The sound of a MAN HUMMING "Hail to the Chief" plays O.S.

93   INT. PRESIDENT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Steam billows up in the shower while Dave scrubs shampoo 
     into his hair.  He massages it vigorously into his scalp 
     while the humming continues.

                           DAVE
               `Bum, bum da dum...'

     He rinses it out and reaches for the soap.   It's a small 
     soap on a rope" designed to look like the Presidential seal...

                           WOMAN
               I can't believe you'd do something 
               like that.  Not even you.

     WIDER

     The door to the shower swings open as Ellen materializes.  
     No queen of England ever looked more regal than Ellen Mitchell 
     in her cloud of steam.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

                           ELLEN
               How could you?

     Dave jumps with a start, then turns away from her quickly, 
     bashfully facing the tile.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     He looks back at Ellen over his shoulder.

                           DAVE
               ... How could I what?

                           ELLEN
               Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize 
               me.   I'm not one of your little...
                    (beat)
               Turn around.  I'm talking to you!...  
               Turn around!

     Dave steels himself then turns slowly around to face her.  
     He strikes a "stoic" pose.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (trembling slightly)
               ... You know, if you want to be the 
               same old bastard, that's fine.  I 
               can handle it.   But don't pull this 
               'man of the people' bullshit and 
               then do something like this.

                           DAVE
                    (frozen; feeling - 
                    very exposed)
               I don't understand.

                           ELLEN
                    (exasperated)
               That's not just a works bill you 
               vetoed -- that would have given these 
               kids homes...
                    (losing it a little)
               ... When I think about that little 
               spectacle you pulled with those 
               muppets and that magic trick...

                           DAVE
               What's wrong with a magic trick?

                           ELLEN
               You made their funding disappear!

     Dave recoils a little.

                           DAVE
               Look.  If there was some mistake...

                           ELLEN
                    (in a rage)
               There's no mistake, Bill.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               If you veto their funding, it's not 
               a mistake.  If you hurt someone 
               intentionally, it's not a mistake.

     She turns and leaves through the steam disappearing as 
     suddenly as she came.  Dave hesitates for an instant, then 
     starts right after her.

94   INT. HALLWAY

     Duane is seated at his regular post when Ellen comes stalking 
     out of Dave's suite. He looks up in amazement as Dave runs 
     out a moment later.   He's dripping wet and clutching a bath 
     towel around his waist.

                           DAVE
                    (turning to Duane)
               Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need 
               them immediately.

                           DUANE
               But it's ten-thirty at night.

     Dave turns and gives him a "Presidential" glare.

                           DUANE (CONT'D)
                    (backing off)
               Yeah, sure. You got it.

95   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dave is seated at his desk, hair still wet, dressed in the 
     Presidential jogging suit. The door bursts open.  It's Bob 
     and Reed.

                           BOB
               What the hell is this?

                           DAVE
               What the hell is <u>this</u>?

     Bob and Reed cross over toward the desk as Dave slams down a 
     copy of rolled up newspaper.

                           BOB
                    (looking at it)
               The Washington Post.

                           DAVE
                    (pounding his finger 
                    on the front page)
               No...

     Bob glances at the paper then hands it to Reed.

                           REED
                    (looking at it; 
                    shrugging)
               President vetoes works bill?

                           DAVE
               We vetoed that?

                           BOB
                    (a slow boil)
               No!...  WE didn't anything...

                           REED
                    (interceding)
               Dave, these things get awfully 
               complicated sometimes...

                           DAVE
               That shelter was in this bill.

                           BOB
                    (losing it)
               ALAN--

                           DAVE
               Lots of shelters were in this bill.

                           BOB
                    (moving toward him))
               Listen, you little...

                           REED
                    (cutting in)
               Dave, the budget's a very complicated 
               thing.  Even I don't understand it 
               sometimes.  Now occasionally we have 
               to make some cuts and...

                           DAVE
               But we went there.  We saw those 
               kids.

                           BOB
               Yeah. And if you can find a way to 
               cut THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION 
               DOLLARS from the federal budget, 
               then you can keep your lousy shelters, 
               okay.

     Dave just looks at him for a moment.

96   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     A small Ford Escort with a Thrifty rent-a-car sticker pulls 
     up to the East Gate of the White House.  It stops just short 
     of the guard station, then rolls forward a few feet and stops 
     again.

     ANGLE - MURRAY

     He leans out of the window, squinting into the sun.  Murray 
     holds a mangled map of Washington in his hand.

                           MURRAY
                    (terrified)
               I'm here to see... the President?

     The guard looks at him without responding.

                           MURRAY (CONT'D)
               He asked me to come.

     The guard reaches for the phone and dials a few numbers.

     Murray jiggles nervously in his seat.

97   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     He sits in the exact same chair that Dave occupied on his 
     arrival.  Murray stares across the Oval Office with a 
     terrified look on his face.

                           MURRAY
                    (urgent whisper)
               I'm serious, Dave -- you could get 
               in a lot of trouble for something 
               like this.

                           DAVE
               It's fine.

                           MURRAY
               They could put you in jail.

                           DAVE
               Why would they do that.  They hired 
               me.

     Murray just stares at him.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               It's kind of a national emergency 
               thing.  I can't really talk about 
               it...

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (confidentially)
               Paying me big money too.   C'mere.

     He leads Murray from the chair to the other side of the desk.

     Dave reaches down opening the bottom drawer.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               See.

     INSERT - DESK DRAWER

     It is full of money.   Neat little stacks of hundred dollar 
     bills.

     ANGLE - MURRAY

     He looks at it wide-eyed,  frozen by what he sees.

                           MURRAY
                    (whispering; indicating 
                    the walls)
               Are we being taped?

                           DAVE
               I don't think so

                           MURRAY
               This is undeclared income.

                           DAVE
               And who's gonna find out?

                           MURRAY
               The government

                           DAVE
               I am the government.

     Murray turns and looks at his best friend, speechless.   He 
     stares at Dave for a couple of seconds when a strange look 
     of wonder crosses his face.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I know -- kind of wild, huh?
                    (beat)
               Let's get to work.

99   INT. PRESIDENTIAL DINING ROOM - LATER

     It is a large oak-lined room in the private residence.

     Dave and Murray sit on either side of a huge dining table 
     with papers strewn all around them.   In front of Murray 
     sits a large,  leather bound volume of the federal budget.

                           MURRAY
               I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been 
               going over this a bunch of times and 
               a lot of this stuff just doesn't add 
               up.
                    (beat)
               Who does these books?

                           DAVE
               I'm not sure.

                           MURRAY
               I just think they make this stuff a 
               lot more complicated than it has to 
               be.

                           DAVE
               I'm not surprised.
                    (beat)
               Can we save anywhere?

                           MURRAY
               Well, yeah.  But you gotta start 
               making some choices.

                           DAVE
               Choices?

                           MURRAY
               You know -- priorities.
                    (thinking)
               Remember when you couldn't get your 
               car fixed `cause you wanted to get 
               that piano?

                           DAVE
                    (hopefully)
               You could buy it on payments.

                           MURRAY
                    (thumping the budget)
               Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 
               400 billion dollar deficit.

                           DAVE
               So what do we do?

                           DAVE
                    (cutting him off)
               It's alright.  I know what you mean.  
               Let's start at the top.

                                                          CUT TO:

100   INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

     It is jammed to capacity.

     The CABINET SECRETARIES are seated around the table while 
     the White House staff lines the walls.   Three television 
     crews are poised in the far corner of the room.

     ANGLE - DOORWAY

     Reed enters and crosses to Dave's regular spot at the cabinet 
     table.   He places a stack of 3 x 5 filing cards next to his 
     water glass and retreats to his seat along the wall.

101   INT. HALLWAY

     Bob moves down the corridor with a little spring in his step.

     He is actually whistling a cheery tune as he carries the 
     morning edition of the Washington Post.

102   INT. CABINET ROOM

     Bob enters with a great big grin and even says hello to a 
     couple of aides.

     CLOSER ANGLE

     Bob sits down next to Reed unfolding a copy of the paper.

                           BOB
                    (whispers)
               Its a work of art.  Look at this 
               thing.

     Reed glances down at the paper.

                           BOB (CONT'D)
                    (reads softly)
               `Vice President's office linked to 
               First Liberty scandal. Justice 
               Department may investigate.'
                    (beat)
               Alan, you're a genius -- we're on 
               our way!

     Bob looks up and glances around.

                           BOB (CONT'D)
                    (pause)
               What's with the cameras?

                           REED
               Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought 
               it was a nice touch.

                           BOB
                    (benignly)
               Oh.  Fine.

     ANGLE - DOORWAY

     Dave enters suddenly, moving quickly into the room.  He nods 
     to the various staff members, crossing to his seat.

                           DAVE
               Good morning, everybody.

                           CABINET
               Good morning, Mr. President.

     Dave takes a stack of index cards from his own pocket and S 
     places them next to Reed's.  He leans forward, clearing his 
     throat.

                           DAVE
                    (purposefully)
               Before we get started today there 
               are a few things I'd like to go over 
               in the budget.

     CLOSEUP - BOB

     He glances up from his report and leans over to Reed.

                           BOB
                    (whispering)
               Do we have anything on the budget 
               today?

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           REED
                    (stunned)
               I don't think so.

     They look slowly toward the table...

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He clutches one of the 3 x 5 cards in his hand.

                           DAVE
               Now I think I've found some ways to 
               put back the homeless section of the 
               Simpson Garner works bill.

     ANGLE - CABINET TABLE

     A slight murmur moves through the Cabinet.

                           BOB
                    (standing up)
               Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe 
               that's on your agenda today.

                           DAVE
                    (pleasantly)
               Well it's a last minute change.

     Bob goes completely white as Dave turns back to the Cabinet 
     table.

     SHOT - DAVE

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               The way I see it we need three hundred 
               and fifty million dollars in order 
               to keep the program.  Now some of 
               this can be achieved through some 
               simple changes in cash management.  
               For example...

     He leans forward onto the table, reading from his card.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               According to the O.M.B. we have 
               seventeen defense contractors who 
               are delinquent in their contracts.
                    (scanning the table)
               Is that true?

                           DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.
               Uh... I believe so...  Yes.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           DAVE
               So even though they're late, we keep 
               paying them on time?

                           DIRECTOR OF O.M.B.
               Well -- in a sense... yeah.

                           DAVE
               Now instead of giving them money for 
               something they haven't finished, we 
               could hold back that cash, put it 
               aside in some interest bearing...

     CLOSEUP - BOB

                           BOB
                    (leaping suddenly to 
                    his feet)
               Mr. President!

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He turns slowly around in his chair.

                           DAVE
                    (daring him)
               Yes?

     BOB'S POV

     He looks at Dave, then out into the room.  Twelve Cabinet 
     Secretaries, the White House staff and three network TV crews 
     are focused right at him.

     WIDER ANGLE

     He stands there, frozen in the glare of the TV lights.  Bob 
     looks at them for a moment then sinks slowly into his seat.

                           BOB
                    (tightly)
               ...Nothing.

                           DAVE
                    (smiling quietly)
               Great.

     He turns back to the table clutching the card in his hand.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Like I was saying, if we took that 
               cash and stuck it in even an ordinary 
               savings account,  we'd be making 
               twelve million a month in interest.

     A murmur goes around the table.  The SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 
     shifts a little in his chair.

                           SECRETARY OF TREASURY
               Well, technically that's true...

     He thinks about it for a moment...

                           SECRETARY OF TREASURY (CONT'D)
               Yes.  Yes, I suppose that's true.

     ANGLE - BOB

     He has taken a handful of curtain and twisted it unconsciously 
     into a rope.  Reed stares straight ahead, stunned.

     ANGLE-DAVE

                           DAVE
               But unfortunately, money management 
               only gets us halfway to our goal.  
               To find the rest of the money, we're 
               going to have to start making some 
               choices -- some pretty tough 
               choices...

     SHOT - BOB

     He seizes Reed's tie, pulling him over.

                           BOB
                    (loud whisper)
               Choices???

     ANGLE - DAVE

               Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the 
               Commerce Department...

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
                    (sitting erect)
               Yes, Mr. President?

                           DAVE
                    (from a card)
               You're spending forty-three million 
               dollars on an ad campaign to...
                    (reading)
               'Boost consumer confidence in the 
               American auto industry.'

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               And it's proving quite effective...

                           DAVE
               Does it make the cars any better?

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual 
               issue.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               Perceptual?

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               Yes, it's designed to bolster 
               individual confidence in a previous 
               domestic automotive purchase.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               Why?

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               Well... to shore up product 
               identification and preserve market 
               share.

                           DAVE
               So we're spending forty-seven million 
               dollars to make people feel better 
               about a car they've already bought?

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               Yes, but I wouldn't...

                           DAVE
                    (indignant)
               Well I'm sure that's really important, 
               but I don't want to tell some eight-
               year-old kid he has to sleep in the 
               street because we want people to 
               feel better about their cars.
                    (beat)
               Do you want to tell him that?

     He gestures toward the TV cameras in the room.

                           SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
               Me?   Uh, no sir... I sure don't.

     ANGLE - BOB AND REED

     Bob fumes at this but a slight smile actually starts to creep 
     up the side of Reed's face.

     ANGLE - DAVE

     He pulls out a pen and jots down a figure...

                           DAVE
               Good.  That gives us another forty-
               seven million.   Now the Postal 
               Service...

                           POSTMASTER GENERAL
                    (sitting up)
               Yes, Mr. President!

103   SAME SCENE - LATER

     Dave's tie is loosened at his throat and there are notes 
     spread out around him. The Cabinet leans forward in their 
     seats.

                           DAVE
               Okay, so that makes...
                    (whispering)
               ... Two, eighty-four, carry the

               program.

     WIDE ANGLE - CABINET ROOM

     The entire room bursts into applause. Bob fumes silently 
     from his spot along the wall as the ovation continues around 
     him.

                                                          CUT TO:

104   INT. HALLWAY

                           VARIOUS CABINET MEMBERS
               Wonderful job, sir... Fantastic, Mr. 
               President.

     Dave moves down the corridor followed by the throng.

105   INT. CABINET ROOM

     Bob stands very still in the center of the empty room.  Reed 
     blocks the door a few feet away.

                           REED
               What are you gonna do?

                           BOB
                    (quietly)
               I'm going to kill him.

                           REED
               You can't kill a President.

     Bob looks at him for a moment, then suddenly explodes.

                           BOB
               He's not a President! He's an ordinary 
               person.  I can kill an ordinary 
               person.

                           REED
               Bob...

                           BOB
               I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.

                           REED
               He's only doing what you told him 
               to.

                           BOB
                    (stunned)
               What I told him to?

                           REED
               I heard you.  You said 'cut three 
               hundred million dollars from the 
               federal budget, and you can keep 
               your homeless shelter.'

                           BOB
               Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why 
               the fuck would I want to save a 
               homeless shelter?

                           REED
               He was only doing his job.

     Bob looks at him for a moment then erupts all over again.

                           BOB
               His job? His job!!!

     He lunges for the door while Reed grabs him around the waist.

               Bob...

                           BOB
                    (thrashing around)
               Was he a senator?  Is he on the 
               Trilateral Commission? Was he in 
               Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS? 

     Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to 
     get free.

                           BOB (CONT'D)
               I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred 
               the bastard!!!

                           REED
               Don't do this.

                           BOB
               I'll lock him away for good.

                           REED
               Then we'll all go to jail together.

     Bob stops struggling suddenly and backs up a step. His eyes 
     narrow to tiny slits.

                           BOB
               What do you mean by that?

                           REED
                    (smoothing out his 
                    suit)

               Are you threatening me?

106   INT. FIRST LADY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ellen is in a meeting with a few people when a MALE AIDE 
     flies through the door handing her the afternoon paper.

                           AIDE
               You won't believe this.

     CLOSEUP - USA TODAY

     The large banner headline stretches across the top of the

               Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later 
               you could come back and we could go 
               to Camp David or something.

                    (looking at his friend)

     Murray FIRES UP the ENGINE as Dave steps back from the car.

     He throws the car into gear and starts down the long, bending 
     driveway toward the gate.  Dave watches from the edge of the 
     lawn with a fond look on his face...

108   INT. RED ROOM - NIGHT

     Duane and Dave are seated across the card table from one 
     another.  Duane's shoulder holster is slung over the back of 
     the chair.   They are drinking beers.

                           DUANE
               Gin.

     He lays down his cards, fanning them out in front of Dave.

                           DAVE
                    (grimacing)
               I was waiting for that jack.

                           DUANE
               I had a feeling.

     Duane Scoops UP the cards and begins to Shuffle.

                           DAVE
               Duane?            

                           DUANE

               How come you went along with all of 
               this?

     Duane stops shuffling and stares at him for a moment.

                           DUANE
               You mean with you and everything?

                           DAVE

               What's that?

                           DUANE
               First thing they teach you at the 
               academy.
                    (remembering their 
                    motto)
               `Don't give me gold and silver, or 
               other worldly things, just the pride 
               and glory of bleeding for my King.'

               You're kidding.

                           DUANE
               No... They don't kid.

     Dave nods solemnly as Duane stares straight ahead.

                           DAVE
               But Bill was your king, not Bob.

                           DUANE
               Yeah, but Bob found me when I was 
               stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
                    (thinks)
               We're trained to be loyal.  You gotta 
               be loyal to someone.

     They sit for a moment in silence.   Duane checks his watch.

                           DAVE
               Didn't mean to bum you out.

                           DUANE
               That's okay.  You alright down here 
               by yourself?

                           DAVE
               Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.

     He nods and heads for the door as Dave picks up the cards.

     He begins to deal out some solitaire,  then senses something 
     and looks toward the door.

     DAVE'S POV

     Ellen stands silhouetted in the doorway wearing a floor- 
     length dressing gown.

                    (quietly)
               Hello.

     ANGLE - DAVE

     Ellen walks forward into the light, tightening the belt at 
     her waist.

                           DAVE
               ...Ellen.

                           ELLEN
               I saw the light.  I thought maybe 
               you were up.

                           DAVE
                    (startled)
               Oh... Yeah.

                           ELLEN
               Mind if I sit down?

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               No.

     He scoops up the cards trying to tidy some of the bottles.

     She studies his face for a couple of seconds then sits down 
     at the table.

                           ELLEN
               That was quite a thing you did today.

                           DAVE
               Anybody would have done it.

                           ELLEN
               Oh, I don't think so.
                    (staring at him)
               Still, you helped a lot of people.

     She continues to stare as Dave looks away.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               Kind of reminds me of that thing you 
               did back in the state legislature.

                           DAVE
               Oh yeah?
                    (nervous)
               Me, too.

                           ELLEN
               You weren't in the state legislature.

     Dave freezes with the deck in his hand.    All at once, Ellen 
     smiles and extends her arm over the table.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               I'm Ellen Mitchell.

     His eyes go wide.  Dave sits stunned trying his best to 
     swallow.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (softly)
               What's your name?

     Dave stares at her, but no words come out.   She leans forward 
     looking right at him.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (evenly)
               Look, I'll make this easy on you.  I 
               never see him anymore.  I barely 
               know him anymore.  I'd just kinda 
               like to... know where he is.

     Dave looks at her, nervously.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               I mean, what is it?  Another 
               Secretary?  A jaunt to the Bahamas 
               with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where 
               is he?

                           DAVE
                    (pause)
               I don't know.

     She looks at him, waiting for a moment.

     No one replies as the elevator doors slide open.

110   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR

     A lone Secret Service man is stationed outside a solid metal 
     door as the three of them approach - - Duane hesitates and 
     looks at Dave.

                           DAVE
                    (calmly)
               Open it.

     Duane looks back at the two of them.

                           ELLEN
               Just open it, please.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     The door swings open as a middle-aged woman in a white uniform 
     appears.  Even in the dim light of the hallway it's clear 
     she is a NURSE.

                           NURSE
               I'm sorry, you're not allowed...

                           DUANE
                    (flashing an I.D.)
               It's alright.

                           NURSE
               Mr. Alexander left strict...

     Before she can even finish Ellen steps quickly by her into 
     the room.  The Nurse recognizes her and just gapes as Duane 
     and Dave enter as well.

111   INT. BASEMENT ROOM

     It is dimly lit like the hallway, except for a group of 
     machines in the corner.  Next to them, a state-of-the-art 
     hospital bed holds the President's lifeless body.  Ellen 
     moves up to the side of the bed.

                           ELLEN
               What happened?

                           DUANE
               It's the stroke.  It's pretty bad.

                           ELLEN
               I don't understand. Is he,  I mean...

     There's a pause.  The Nurse looks down.   Ellen clutches the 
     railings of the bed.

                           DUANE
               I'm sorry.

     All at once she starts to cry.  Dave moves over to try to 
     comfort her when she shakes him off violently.

                           ELLEN
               Don't touch me, please.

     Dave recoils.   She turns to him with an enraged look in her 
     eye.   He moves back a step.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (furious)
               When were you all planning to tell 
               me? A year from now?  After the 
               election...
                    (whirling on him)
               What's going on here?

     Dave hesitates.

                           DAVE
               They asked me to help.

                           ELLEN
               I'm sure they did.  'State of 
               Emergency.'  'National Security.' 
               You ever hear of the Constitution?

     He doesn't respond.  Ellen glares at him for a moment, then 
     glances around the room...

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               Could all of you just leave me alone 
               for a minute.

                           NURSE
               I'm really not supposed to...

                           ELLEN
               Get out!

     Dave motions toward Duane as the two of them guide the nurse 
     into the hallway.  They shut the door behind them.

     CLOSEUP - ELLEN

     She stares down at the lifeless body while the sound of the 
     RESPIRATOR fills the room.

112   INT. ELLEN'S ROOM - LATER

     Suitcases are flung open and she kneels on the floor.  Ellen 
     throws piles of clothing into the large open valise when she 
     senses something and glances up..

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Dave is standing in the doorway.  She looks at him for a 
     moment, but goes right back to packing.  He stands in the 
     doorway, staring while she crams some shoes in the bag.

                           DAVE
               You're leaving?

                           ELLEN
                    (clipped)
               I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I 
               shouldn't be here.

                           DAVE
               Where are you going?

                           ELLEN
               Home.

     She grabs a blouse from the bed and flings t into the 
     suitcase.

                           DAVE
               Where's home?

                           ELLEN
                    (looking up)
               Oh, they didn't brief you on that?  
               How sloppy of them.

     She looks at Dave and stops.  All at once Ellen stops packing 
     and lowers a shoe to her side.

     HER POV - REVERSE ANGLE

     Dave stands in the doorway with a small valise in his hand.

     He looks like he did a month ago, with the tortoise shell 
     glasses and his old blue windbreaker. The valise is a tiny 
     overnight bag with small black handles.  A seal of the 
     President embossed into the leather.

                           DAVE
                    (shrugging)
               Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.

                           ELLEN
                    (beat)
               You1re leaving, too?

                           DAVE
                    (nodding)
               I never wanted to hurt anybody.
                    (beat)
               In fact... I even thought I was 
               helping.

     Ellen just looks at him for a moment.  Her mouth opens 
     slightly but no words come out.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Hey... It's...

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Ellen is crying.  She shakes her head and turns away from 
     him.

                           DAVE
               Here.

     Dave unzips the valise and fishes out a hanky.  The 
     Presidential Seal is nicely embroidered in one corner.  Ellen 
     looks down at it and smiles slightly.

                           ELLEN
               You know you make this little deal 
               with yourself.  You can put up with 
               the other women and you can do without 
               a life because you believe in what 
               you're doing -- and if you can just 
               keep your mouth shut...

     She can't finish.

                           DAVE
               You thought you had a chance to help 
               people...

     Their eyes lock for an instant when she turns and goes back 
     to packing.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (softly)
               How were you gonna get home?

                           ELLEN
               I don't know.  I hadn't thought it 
               out that far.

     CLOSEUP - DAVE

     He looks at her for a moment...

                                                          CUT TO:

113   INT. SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

     Dave carries Ellen's suitcase in one hand and his own valise 
     in the other.  They step over the puddles and leaky water 
     pipes as they duck below the six-foot ceiling.  Dave carries 
     a flashlight.

                           ELLEN
               You sure this goes somewhere?

                           DAVE
               Truman used it all the time.

     Dave pauses and shines the light up a leaky old set of stairs 
     that head off to their right.  Ellen hesitates for a moment, 
     looking up the staircase.

                           ELLEN
               You don't have to keep walking with 
               me.   I'm okay from here.

                           DAVE
               I don't mind.

                           ELLEN
                    (looking at him)
               Thanks.

     Ellen hesitates for a second, then hikes up her skirt and 
     moves through the portal.

114   EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

     It is directly across the street from the White House.  A 
     lone street lamp illuminates the corner including a small, 
     recessed alcove where a staircase leads up from below.

     CLOSER SHOT

     Dave and Ellen emerge stepping out onto the sidewalk.

                           ELLEN
               Huh.

                           DAVE
               Duane said he'd leave the car over 
               here.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     He leads Ellen around a corner where a small brown Plymouth 
     sits parked at the curb. Dave fishes through his pockets and 
     pulls out the car keys.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (handing them to her)
               Here you go.

     Ellen looks down at the car keys.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               He said he'll pick it up in a couple 
               of days.

                           ELLEN
               Oh... Okay.

     She glances at the Plymouth then back a Dave.  She just stares 
     at him for a moment.

                           DAVE
               What?

                           ELLEN
                    (shaking her head)
               It's just so strange...

     Dave looks at her.  Ellen takes a deep breath.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
               I lock at you and I see Bill...
                    (turning to him)
               I mean, he's almost dead, but he's 
               right here... I mean, you're right 
               here... alive and...

                           DAVE
               I'm not Bill Mitchell.

     She looks at him.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               In fact, I'm not anything like him 
               and... I guess I want you to know 
               that.

                           ELLEN
                    (quietly)
               He wasn't always like that, anyway.

     Their eyes lock for a second.

                    (suddenly)
               Are you hungry?

                    (beat)
               What?

                           DAVE
                    (smiling a little)
               I'm starving.   There's got to be 
               something open around here.

     Ellen stares at him for a moment,  then finally smiles...

115   EXT.  7-11 - NIGHT

     It is a twenty-four-hour convenience store.   Even at two in 
     the morning, several cars are parked in the lot.

     Ellen sits on the passenger side of Plymouth with her door 
     locked.   Dave emerges carrying a brown paper bag.

     He pops the driver's side door and hops inside.

116   INT. CAR

                           ELLEN
               I really don't have much of an 
               appetite.

                           DAVE
                    (looking over at her)
               Just wait.

     He FIRES UP the CAR.

                                                          CUT TO:

117   EXT. "THE MALL" - NIGHT

     The monuments are illuminated a glittering white.  The Lincoln 
     Memorial and Capitol Dome stand out against the long field 
     of grass.

                           ELLEN (O.S.)
                    (eating Dave's "special 
                    sandwich")
               This is good.  What's in it?

     CLOSER SHOT

     They sit side by side on a raised, grassy mound at the base 
     of the Washington Monument.  A large bath towel is spread 
     out between them with the Presidential Seal at the center.

     Dave's bag is opened at their side.

                           DAVE
               That's a secret.

                           ELLEN
                    (taking another bite)
               You have a lot of secrets.

                           DAVE
               I guess.

     AFTER A BEAT:

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               When did you know?... About me.

     She pauses.

                           ELLEN
               I think in the car.

                           DAVE
               The car?

                           ELLEN
               On the way to the homeless shelter.  
               You looked at my leg.
                    (pause)
               Bill lost interest a long time ago.

     He turns and looks at her.

                           DAVE
               That's good.  I was worried it was 
               the shower.

     She smiles.  They are perched on a small hill overlooking 
     the White House.

                           ELLEN
               So what do you do the rest of the 
               time?

                           DAVE
                    (smiling)

                           ELLEN
               Yes.

                           DAVE
               I run a temp agency.

     She looks at him.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               You know, secretaries and stiff.

                           ELLEN
                    (smiles)
               You find people jobs?

                           DAVE
               Yeah.  Is that funny?

                           ELLEN
               It's just more than anybody else 
               does around here.

                           DAVE
               Well don't get carried away -- I'm 
               not that good at it.

     She turns and studies him for a moment.

                           ELLEN
                    (suddenly personal)
               And your family?   I assume you're 
               married?

     He turns back to her.   A couple of seconds go by.

                           DAVE
               I was... once.
                    (pause)
               It didn't take.

     Ellen laughs and looks out over the mall.    Dave takes 
     another swig of his soda.

                           ELLEN
                    (quietly)
               You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't 
               it?  I can't keep all of this a 
               secret.

                           DAVE
               I know.

                           ELLEN
               But you could go to jail for it.

     He turns and looks at her.    There doesn't seem to be any 
     fear.

                           DAVE
               Yeah, I know.

     Ellen turns and studies him.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I liked doing it,  though.  Not the 
               fancy stuff with the helicopter or 
               the TV cameras but...

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Ellen keeps staring at him.  Dave glances back.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I liked saving that shelter.  I liked 
               helping people I hadn't even met 
               before.

     It's quiet for a moment.  He stares back at the White House.

                    (pause)
               And right then I felt like I wasn't 
               pretending anymore.

     CLOSER

     Several seconds go by.  Dave stares off at the White House 
     across the mall while Ellen studies his face.

                           ELLEN
               I don't think you were pretending.

     Dave turns to her as their eyes lock.

                           DAVE
               I liked being married to you.

     Ellen turns all the way around on the blanket staring at him 
     from less than a foot away.

                           ELLEN
               What would you do if you were still 
               in there?  If you had one more chance 
               to be President, what would you do 
               then?

118   EXT. WHITE HOUSE GATE - NIGHT

     The small brown Plymouth rolls up to the guard gate as the 
     uniformed officer leans out of his booth.

               I'm sorry, sir.  There's no

                           DAVE
               Just getting some air.

                           GUARD
               Certainly, sir... How did...

     Ellen leans across him toward the window.

                           ELLEN
                    (confidentially)
               The President wanted some ice cream.

     The Guard snaps off a crisp salute as Dave casually returns 
     it.  The gate raises in front of them as he steps on the 
     gas.

119   INT. WHITE HOUSE LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Dave and Ellen stand at the top of the long staircase that 
     leads to the living quarters. Ellen looks up at him for a 
     moment, then smiles.

                           ELLEN
                    (softly)
               ... You make a nice President, Dave 
               Kovic... go for it.

     Ellen looks him in the eye for a moment, then turns and heads 
     off toward her suite.  Dave stands there watching her recede 
     down the hall...

120   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     A lone gardener rides his lawn mower across the lawn...

121   WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

     It is jammed full of the White House Press Corps.   A hundred 
     or so REPORTERS mill about while they wait for the start of 
     a press conference.

                           REPORTER #1
               Bet it's that Fidelity thing.

                           REPORTER #2
               Think they're gonna ditch the Veep?

     The first guy nods.

                    (confident)
               He's finished.

               Toast.

     They all nod together.

122   INT. HALLWAY

     Bob moves down the corridor with his briefcase in his hand.

     He glances up and notices action from the briefing room.

                           BOB
                    (to himself)
               What the hell...

123   INT. EAST ROOM

     The sound of a man desperately containing a SCREAM ECHOES 
     THROUGH the public rooms on the first floor.  Bob comes 
     sprinting into the large open receiving room, taking out one 
     of the little rope stanchions that guide the visiting tourists 
     through.   He keeps on running...

124   INT. REED'S OFFICE

     Reed glances up from his desk as Bob charges into the room.

                           REED
                    (quickly)
               I didn't call it.   He called it 
               himself...  I swear to God.

     Bob just looks at him, then turns and bolts into the hallway.

125   INT. GREAT HALL

     A small group of tourists stands in the large marble entry.

     They stare up at the staircase while their TOUR GUIDE 
     describes some of the artwork.

                           GUIDE
               ... Jackson is the figure that you

               House Chief of Staff...

     ANGLE - BOB

     He comes careening into the foyer, skittering across the 
     polished marble.

                           GUIDE (CONT'D)

126   INT. OVAL OFFICE

     Dave sits on the couch, jotting some notes on a legal pad.

     The door swings open behind him.

                           BOB
               What do you think you're doing?!

               I have a couple of ideas I wanted to

                           BOB
               You don't call a press conference.  
               I call a press conference!

     Dave just stares.

                           BOB (CONT'D)
               You're nothing.  Do you understand 
               me!  You're NOBODY...

                           DAVE
                    (slowly)
               I'm... not... nobody...

               You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're

                           DAVE
               Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.

     Bob backs up a step and stares at him.

                           BOB
               ... what?

                           DAVE
               I said you're fired.  Go on -- get 
               outta here.

     Bob just looks at him, stunned.

                           BOB
               Oh... I'm fired?

                           DAVE
               Yeah.

     He stops and stares at Dave.

                           BOB
               You're fired.

                           DAVE
                    (fine)
               Fine...

     He stares at him again.

                           DAVE
               Fine.

     He crosses to the door of the Oval Office and flings it open 
     wide.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               You got the whole Press Corps out 
               there.  Why don't you just go tell 
               'em.

     Bob's eyes narrow a little.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Go on.   Be my guest.

     CLOSER

     They stare at each other for a long moment.    Neither man 
     moves as they stand toe to toe in the center of the carpet.   
     For a second,  it isn't clear who's going to win, until...

                           WOMAN (O.S.)
               Darling...

     Ellen comes over and takes his arm.

                           ELLEN
                    (Audrey Hepburn)
               Darling, they're all waiting for you 
               in the Press Room - - you've really 
               got to get going...
                    (as if seeing him for 
                    the first time)
               Oh, Bob...
                    (back to Dave)
               I'm sorry, darling.   I thought you 
               were alone - -

     Ellen turns toward Bob with a sudden grin.   His expression 
     falls visibly as the weight of their alliance becomes clear.

                           DAVE
               I'd like your resignation on my desk 
               by the time I get back.

     CLOSEUP - BOB

     He looks at them stunned and defeated...

127   INT. PRESS ROOM - LATER

     It is packed to capacity.  Dave stands alone at the podium 
     while the press corps crowds every inch of the Briefing Room.

     He stares squarely into the cameras.

                           DAVE
               Thanks for coming on such short 
               notice.

     WIDER

     Reed stands off to the side with an almost mesmerized look 
     on his face.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               First, I'd like to announce something 
               that might come as a surprise to 
               many of you.
                    (beat)
               I've asked Bob Alexander to resign 
               as White House Chief of Staff.

     A murmur goes through the Press Room.   Dave looks straight 
     ahead.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Sometimes, two people just change 
               and it's better for everybody if 
               they go their own way.
                    (beat)
               Over the last few months, Bob and I 
               have come to believe in different 
               things.   He thinks this country is 
               fine and we should go about doing 
               business as usual.
                    (beat)
               I just don't feel that way.  Not 
               anymore.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Because things aren't fine.  And you 
               know that and I know that.  And we 
               can keep lying to ourselves, but 
               it's a little late for that.
                    (getting angry)
               We've got water we can't drink and 
               air we can't breathe.   We've got 
               bars on our windows and graffiti on 
               our doors.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               If you get sick you can't afford to 
               go to the doctor and if you get laid 
               off you can't find a new job.  We're 
               trillions of dollar in debt.  Our 
               roads are cracking, our bridges are 
               crumbling and everything we used to 
               build is made in Japan.  We've got 
               people sleeping in cardboard boxes,  
               and ten-year-old kids who are doing 
               drugs.  We've been living together 
               for four hundred years, and we're 
               still trying to kill each other...  
               But that isn't even the worst part.  
               The worst part is we feel like we 
               can't do anything about it.

     CLOSER

     He looks out over the room and pauses.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               So I've decided that while I'm 
               President,  I should actually try to 
               do things... even if they seem 
               impossible.

     Dave glances toward the wings for a moment and turns back.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               First off I'm initiating a program 
               to try to find a decent job for every 
               American who wants one.

     A murmur moves through the press room.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (hearing them)
               Why start here?
                    (pause)
               Because if you've ever seen the look 
               on someone's face the day they get a 
               job -- I've had some personal 
               experience with this - - they look 
               like they could fly.  And unless we 
               start tapping into that kind of spirit 
               again, there's no way we're gonna 
               fix anything in this country.

     He looks out at them and pauses.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               So... Let's get to work.

                           MICHAEL KINSELY (V.O.)
               Well he's certainly got my vote.

     The TELEVISION SUDDENLY SWITCHES OFF as the CAMERA WIDENS 
     OUT to reveal:

130   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dave, slumping back from the TV into an armchair.

                           DAVE
               Thank God for that.

     WIDER

     Dave, Ellen, Reed, Ellen's Aide, and two other advisors are 
     camped in front of the television set.  There are documents 
     and newspapers scattered over the room.  A take-out pizza 
     sits incongruously on the coffee table.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Let's call it a night.   I can't 
               take any more.

                           REED
               Right.  We can pick up on the rest 
               tomorrow.

     Everyone starts to get up, gathering their papers.

                           ELLEN'S AIDE
                    (moving toward the 
                    door)
               I'll have those employment figures 
               to you by eight-thirty...

                           REED
               And we've got that labor briefing at 
               nine.

                           DAVE
                    (bleary eyed)
               Terrific.

     Everyone starts to move through the door, leaving Dave and 
     Ellen suddenly alone.  They are standing face to face.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Well I guess...

                           ELLEN
               Yeah... Bedtime.

     Their faces are very close.  Their eyes express great need.

     He moves slowly toward her in a kiss.  Their lips meet for 
     an instant.

                           DAVE
                    (pulling back)
               What?

                           ELLEN
               I can't.

                           DAVE
                    (quickly)
               I know. I'm sorry...

                           ELLEN
               I mean, I want to... I just, I feel 
               strange...

                           DAVE
                    (even quicker)
               That's okay.

     They stand there facing one another like two kids on a front 
     porch.

131   INT. DAVE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     He lies under the covers staring at the ceiling. Dave suddenly 
     turns and punches the pillow.

132   INT. ELLEN'S ROOM

     She lies on her bed in exactly the same position. After a 
     moment, Ellen turns and buries her face in the pillow.

                           ELLEN
                    (muffled)
               This is crazy...

                                                          CUT TO:

133   INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY

     Dave and Duane move down the corridor that leads to the Oval 
     Office.  Duane is flipping through a handful of newspapers.

                           DUANE
               The U.S. News hammered us.  But 
               they're always tough on that kind of 
               thing.  Rosenthal loved us in the 
               Times

                           RANDI
               Mr. President, Mr. Nance is waiting 
               inside for you.

                           DAVE
               Who?

                           DUANE
                    (freezing)
               The Vice-President...

                           DAVE
               Oh... right...
                    (to Randi, nervous 
                    smile)
               You know, ever since the stroke...

     Dave points to his temple and gives the "wobbly" sign with 
     his hand.   He glances at Duane for a second, then turns and 
     heads inside...

134   INT. OVAL OFFICE

     Seated, with his back to the door, is the silhouette of a 
     man holding an eight-foot spear.  Beside him on the floor is 
     a large ceremonial headdress.  Dave moves forward cautiously.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     The Vice President turns and slowly rises to face him.  He's 
     a strong-looking man in a plain gray suit with an honest 
     looking face.

                           NANCE
               Mr. President.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The two men shake hands.  Nance continues to stare at him 
     while Dave moves toward his chair.  After a moment, Nance 
     extends the headdress.

                           NANCE (CONT'D)
                    (curtly)
               This is from the people of Burundi...

                           DAVE
                    (taking it)
               Oh... Thanks.

                           NANCE
               And these are a gift from the King 
               of Togo.

     Nance hands him what appears to be a group of large necklaces.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               What are they?

                           NANCE
                    (deadpan)
               Fertility beads.

                           DAVE
               Ah.

     He sets them quickly on the desk while Nance just stares at 
     him.

                           NANCE
               Mr. President, may I speak frankly 
               with you?

                           DAVE
               Certainly.

     CLOSEUP - NANCE

     He hesitates for a moment.   Nance gathers his thoughts, 
     then proceeds.

                           NANCE
                    (with dignity)
               I know we haven't always gotten along.  
               I know we've disagreed politically 
               and I suppose I know what you think 
               of me personally...

     WIDER

     Nance takes a deep breath.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           NANCE (CONT'D)
               ... But I've always tried to respect 
               the role you wanted me to play.  
               When I've disagreed with this 
               administration I've kept it to myself.  
               When you wanted my support you always 
               had it.

     Dave nods, frozen in his chair.  Nance looks at him a moment 
     then suddenly lets it out.

                           NANCE (CONT'D)
               Dammit, Bill -- how could you do 
               something like this to me?

     Dave just looks at him speechless.  Neither man moves.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               Something like what...

                           NANCE
               Oh, come on, we're not children.  I 
               didn't have anything to do with this 
               Fidelity nonsense and you know it.

                           DAVE
                    (nodding)
               The Fidelity nonsense...

                           NANCE
                    (showing him a 
                    newspaper)
               All I've got is my integrity.  That's 
               all I have.  Now I don't know why 
               you turned your attack dogs on me.

                           DAVE
                    (interrupting)
               They re not my attack dogs.

                           NANCE
                    (taken aback)
               What do you mean?

                           DAVE
               I just fired Bob Alexander.

     Nance looks at him, stunned.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Don't worry.  I'll take care of it.

135   INT. REED'S OFFICE - DAY

     He sits behind his sleek Italian desk with a slightly sheepish 
     look on his face. Dave stands across from him, leaning on 
     his feet.

                           DAVE
               What do you mean you made it all up?

                           REED
               We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir 
               boy.

                           DAVE
               This is wrong, Alan!

                           REED
                    (like a novel, new 
                    concept)
               Wrong...

                           DAVE
               Alan...

                           REED
               Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully 
               bad.  It's really embarrassing.
                    (beat)
               But it was Bob's idea.

     Dave looks at him horrified.

                           DAVE
               We've got to fix this.

                           REED
               Absolutely.  Well, that might be 
               kind of tough. Once the press starts 
               smelling blood...

     The door blows open behind them.

                           ELLEN (O.S.)
               Dave...

                           WIDER
               She flies into the room with a worried 
               look on her face.  Dave and Reed 
               watch while she heads toward the 
               "media center" in the corner.

                           REED
                    (shocked)
               `Dave'?

                           DAVE
               She knows.

                           ELLEN
               Look at this.

     Ellen flicks ON the SET to catch a NEWS REPORT in mid-segment.

     TV SCREEN

                           NINA TOTENBERG (V.O.)
                    (over TV)
               ... The hastily called news conference 
               at the National Press Club was Bob 
               Alexander's first public comment 
               since resigning as White House Chief 
               of Staff.  It turned out to be nothing 
               short of a full-fledged salvo fired 
               directly at Pennsylvania Avenue.

     Bob appears in a film clip, speaking before the National 
     Press Club.   Even beneath the professional cool, he seems 
     to relish the lethal sound bite.

                           BOB (V.O.)
                    (over TV)
               When I first began to look into the 
               allegations concerning Fidelity 
               Savings and Loan, I thought the 
               wrongdoing was restricted to the 
               Vice President's office...

     They glance at each other then back at the set...

                    (over TV; dramatic)
               ... I was saddened to discover at 
               least fifteen separate acts of 
               intervention by this administration, 
               most with the full knowledge of the 
               President and all of them illegal.  
               Federal regulators were influenced, 
               records were destroyed, and pressure 
               was brought to bear, in same cases 
               by President Mitchell himself.

                           DAVE
                    (stunned)
               Now he's making stuff up about me.

                           REED
               He's not.

     They turn and look at him.

                           DAVE
                    (sighing)
               He's not making it up.

     Dave stares at him stunned.   Ellen gets it immediately.

                           ELLEN
                    (softly)
               Bob never left Bill's side.  He knows 
               where all the old bones are buried...

     Dave glances back and forth between them but neither one of 
     them speaks...

137   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     A long line of black sedans with congressional plates pulls 
     up to the South Portico.   In the distance, beyond the fence, 
     a crowd of protesters shout at the White House.

138   INT. PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE DINING ROOM

     A small delegation of congressional leaders has requested a 
     lunch with the President.  Reed and Ellen are also present.

     The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE leans forward over his plate.

                           SPEAKER
                    (a Southerner)
               Mr. President, I don't know another 
               way to put it, but 'This dawg just 
               won't hunt.'

     Dave just stares at him without responding.

                           MAJ. LEADER
               We may be able to hold off this First 
               Liberty thing for a little while, 
               but if you go running around the 
               country with this new jobs idea...

                           SPEAKER
               They're gonna put us on a spit an' 
               bring in the sauce.

                           FEMALE SENATOR
               If you just waited for a little 
               while...

                           DAVE
               I don't want to wait for a little 
               while.

                           SPEAKER
               Mr. President, I understand that.  
               But sometimes ya fight an' sometimes 
               ya run.

                           ELLEN
                    (suddenly)
               That's not what you said during your 
               ethics investigation.

     WIDER

     Every eye in the room turns toward her.  The Speaker stares 
     daggers across the table.

                           SPEAKER
               I beg your pardon?

                           ELLEN
               When you needed the President's help, 
               you got it.

                           SPEAKER
                    (controlled)
               Ma'am, no one appreciates your 
               husband's help more'n me.   I'm just 
               saying that this jobs thing is a 
               little unwieldy...'

                           NANCE
                    (chiming in)
               It is not.

     Every eye shifts to the Vice President.

               There's lots of ways to make it work.  
               You could have targeted tax credits

               ain't some city council silliness 
               that's gonna blow over.  We're talking

     CLOSEUP - BOB ALEXANDER

     It is a video clip from his lethal press conference.  Bob 
     faces the camera directly.

                           BOB (V.O.)
               ... At least fifteen separate acts 
               of intervention by this 
               administration, most with full 
               knowledge of the President..

               too.

     FREEZE FRAME.

139   INT. OVAL OFFICE

     Dave sits in front of his bookcase with a remote control in 
     his hand.   He turns to see the Vice President, standing by 
     the edge of the carpet.

                           DAVE
               Oh... Hi.

               He's not gonna win -- not in the

     Dave looks back at him.

     Nance shifts a little by the bookcase.

                           NANCE (CONT'D)
               Mr. President, whatever happens I 
               just wanted you to know that I think 
               that your jobs program is a wonderful 
               idea...

                           DAVE
               Not that anyone's gonna pay much 
               attention now... But thanks.

     Neither one says anything.  Dave motions to a chair.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Want to sit down?

     He takes a seat across from the desk.   Nance glances over 
     at the TV as both men look at the freeze frame of Bob.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               You ever think back to how you

     They smile together for a moment.

                           NANCE (CONT'D)
               One day my wife says to me 'Why don't 
               you try running for office.  You 
               talk about it all the time, why don't 
               you just do it?'

               So I tell my boss I have a dentist 
               appointment and I go down to the 
               registrar of voters on my lunch break.
                    (shakes his head)
               Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.

                           DAVE

               With advertising.

     Dave just looks at him for a long moment.

     Dave walks alone down the long pergola that flanks the Rose

     All the roses are shimmering in the late afternoon light.

     Dave looks at them for a second...

141   INT. LIVING QUARTERS - MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

     The CAMERA MOVES WITH Dave as he heads down the long corridor 
     toward Ellen's side of the living quarters.  He holds a large 
     yellow rose in his hand.  Dave pauses in front of her door, 
     knocks and waits for a moment.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Dave steps inside the room.

                           DAVE
               Hello?

     HIS POV

     It's a lively room, especially for the White House.  Across 
     the room one of the French doors is open wide.  The curtains 
     billow out to the terrace beyond.

142   EXT. TERRACE

     Dave steps outside, and looks around.  It's a beautiful, 
     warm night. The Washington Monument soars in the distance 
     with the Jefferson Memorial just a speck beyond.  Dave hears 
     SOMETHING in the distance.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     He rounds the corner to find Ellen standing all alone by the 
     edge of the balustrade. He moves quietly up toward the railing 
     as she turns and looks at him.  He extends the rose, holding 
     it out.

                           DAVE
               I brought you something.

                           ELLEN
                    (reserved)
               ... Thanks.

     CLOSER ANGLE

     It's only half a smile.   He moves closer and pauses.

                           DAVE
                    (softly)
               What's wrong?

                           ELLEN
                    (after a pause)
               Looks like we're not going to get a 
               chance to get much done.

     Dave thinks about it and nods.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (softer)
               They're crucifying you out there.

                           DAVE
               Yeah, but we got a little bit done.

     And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the 
     next guy'll do a little...

                           ELLEN
               You really believe that?

                           DAVE
               Yeah.
                    (pauses, quieter)
               And it's better than not believing 
               it.

     Their faces are inches apart.

                           ELLEN
                    (softly)
               I sure fall for some weird guys.

     Slowly, almost imperceptibly, they come together in a kiss.

     It's soft and tender at first -- then builds in passion and 
     need.

     A lone CHURCH BELL from the National Cathedral starts CHIMING 
     at midnight.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Dave and Ellen part, drawn by the sound.  After a moment, 
     Dave looks slowly back at her.

                           DAVE
                    (beat)
               Nance is a good man, isn't he?

     She just looks at him.   It's a strange expression -- part 
     sadness, part fear, part intrigue...

               Yeah.   He's a good man.

                           DAVE
                    (off her look)
               What?

     She shakes her head.   He touches the side of her face.

                           ELLEN
               I'm just getting to know you -- I 
               don't want to lose you.

     They come together and kiss again.  Even with everything 
     left unsaid, there's a sadness in the air.

     WIDENING OUT...

     Two small figures cling onto each other by the third floor 
     balustrade of the White House...

                           SANDER VANOCUR
               The President has requested this 
               rare joint session of Congress so 
               that he could personally answer the 
               allegations raised by Bob Alexander, 
               his former Chief of Staff...

147   INT. LIVING ROOM (GEORGETOWN) - DAY

     Bob stands in a cardigan sweater holding a tumbler full of 
     bourbon while his cocktail party is going full swing.  Several 
     inside the beltway fat cats mill about the living room while 
     Vanocur continues on the TV:

                           SANDER VANOCUR (V.O.)
               Speculation on the President's 
               response has run the gamut from a 
               full-fledged denial right up to the 
               possibility that he might resign.

     There are hoots and hollers in the room.  One of the GUESTS 
     raises a glass in salute.

                           GUEST #1
                    (to Bob)
               Here's to you, Mr. President.

     Another guest holds up a bumper sticker with "ALEXANDER FOR 
     PRESIDENT" printed in large block letters.

               Let's wait for the speech first.
                    (false humility)
               Don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

148   INT.  ELLEN'S BEDROOM

     She sits tensely in front of her television...

149   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER

     The tension in the room builds as everyone awaits the arrival 
     of the President.

150   INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - CLOAK ROOM

     THROUGH a crack in the doorway, most of the House Chamber is 
     visible.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal: Dave and Reed, 
     standing alone in the small ante-room.  There is a plain, 
     black briefcase sitting between them.

                           DAVE
               Is everything clear with Duane?

     Reed nods and hands him the briefcase.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               And this is all of it?

     He nods again.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Well -- here we go.

     Dave tries to take briefcase but Reed keeps holding onto it 
     out of reflex and self-preservation.  Dave smiles at him and 
     gently starts to unpry Reed's fingers.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Relax, Alan... Enjoy the moment.

     Reed looks at him and tries to nod...

151   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER

     Everyone stands at their seats when the SERGEANT AT ARMS 
     walks down the aisle, pounding a six-foot staff three times 
     on the House floor.

                           SERGEANT AT ARMS
               Mr. Speaker... The President of the 
               United States.

     WIDER ANGLE

     The response is more of a murmur than the usual applause.  
     Dave appears at the back of the Chamber carrying the black 
     briefcase.  He makes his way up the aisle and mounts the 
     five steps that lead to the podium.

     SHOT - DAVE

     He reaches the lectern and glances behind him.  Dave locks 
     eyes with Vice President Nance for a moment,  flashing him a 
     smile.

152   INT. BOB'S TOWN HOUSE

     It looks like a Superbowl party.   All of Bob's cronies have 
     gathered around the TV set to watch "Bill Mitchell's" 
     political demise.  A huge grin spreads across Bob's face 
     when Dave's image appears on the screen.

                           BOB
               Shhh shh... Here it comes.

153   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER

     Dave swallows once and grips the lectern.

                           DAVE
               Thank you.
                    (pause)
               I wish I could be here today under 
               different circumstances...

     CLOSER SHOT

     He hesitates for a moment.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               There's certainly a lot of things 
               about this country that we should be 
               discussing, but I realize that's not 
               possible now.
                    (beat)
               As all of you know, my former Chief 
               of Staff has implicated me in a 
               scandal involving Fidelity Savings 
               and Loan.

     REVERSE ANGLE - HOUSE

     Every member sits motionless at their seat.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               ... And once people start talking 
               about scandal it's hard for them to 
               talk about anything else.

     He scans the room.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               So fine.   Let's talk about it.

154   INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM

     She watches riveted from the edge of her bed.

                           DAVE
                    (over TV)
               Bob Alexander has accused me of...
                    (pulls some notes out 
                    of his pocket)
               Let me read this to make sure I get 
               it right...

155   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER

     He stares at his notes.

                           DAVE
               ... Illegally influencing government 
               regulators on behalf of major campaign 
               contributors -- interfering with an 
               ongoing Justice Department 
               investigation -- and violating Federal 
               election laws in the area of campaign 
               finance.

     There isn't a sound in the Chamber.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Okay -- let's get right to the guts 
               of it...  Each one of these charges 
               is absolutely true.

     A quiet but shocked murmur rolls through the room.

156   INT. BOB'S HOUSE

     A "war whoop" goes up from the guests. Bob almost seems to 
     levitate off the couch.

                           BOB
               Die, you pond scum!

157   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - FULL SHOT - DAVE

                           DAVE
               I'm the President and as they say 
               'The buck stops here.'  So I take 
               full responsibility for every one of 
               my illegal acts.

     He hoists the black briefcase up onto the podium.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               But you see that's not the whole 
               story, and I think each one of you 
               is entitled to the truth.

     Dave opens the black briefcase to reveal a large stack of 
     documents.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I have written proof here in the 
               form of...
                    (reading)
               Notes, memoranda and personal 
               directives' proving that Bob Alexander 
               was involved in each one of these 
               incidents and in most cases planned 
               them as well...

158   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - CLOSEUP - BOB

     There is silence in the room.   All the color drains from 
     his face as Bob stares frozen at the television set.  The 
     others in the room watch with the morbid fascination of 
     someone witnessing a car wreck.

                           BOB
                    (almost a gasp)
               Alan...

     One of the guests furtively slides his Presidential bumper 
     sticker behind the onion dip.

159   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - FULL SHOT - REED

     He stares out at the House Chamber feeling downright "moral."

     He looks like someone who has just saved a puppy.

     CLOSEUP - DAVE

                           DAVE
               Now - - allegations of wrong-doing 
               have also been made against Vice 
               President Nance...
                    (pause)
               I'm afraid that's just a lie.

     FULL SHOT - VICE PRESIDENT

     He sits motionless in the chair feeling the weight of every 
     eye in the room.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               ... As this evidence will show...  
               At no time and in no way was Vice 
               President Nance involved in any of 
               this affair.  Bob made all of that 
               up.

     Dave turns and smiles at Nance for a moment.

160   FULL SHOT - PODIUM

     Dave turns back toward the House.

                           DAVE
               Vice president Nance is a good and

               And while we're setting the record 
               straight, I'd also like to apologize 
               to the American people...

     CLOSER ON DAVE

     Right INTO CAMERA.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               ... I forgot that I was hired to do 
               a job for you and that it was just a 
               temp job at that. I forgot that I 
               had two hundred and fifty million 
               people who were paying me to make 
               their lives a little better and I 
               didn't live up to my part of the 
               bargain.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               See, there are certain things you 
               should expect from a President.  I 
               ought to care more about you than I 
               do about me... I ought to care more 
               about what's right than I do about

                           DAVE
               If I'm not...

     Dave stops in mid-sentence.  He raises his hand to his 
     forehead and seems to rock a moment.  A concerned murmur 
     runs through the floor of the House.

163   FULL SHOT - DAVE

     He clutches the lectern now with a "woozy" look on his face.

     He "fights to stand up."

                           DAVE
               If I'm not... Then I don't belong 
               here in the first place...

     All at once, Dave falls to the floor.    Duane and Reed and 
     several Senate pages suddenly rush out to his side.

164   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - PODIUM

     It is complete pandemonium.    Several members crowd around 
     the podium.    The NOISE LEVEL literally turns into a ROAR.

     Reed yanks at Dave's shirt and loosens his tie.

     A huge crowd of Congressmen crowd around the platform.  There 
     is complete confusion...

167   EXT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - PARKING LOT - DAY

     The standard issue ambulance that follows the President I 
     everywhere is parked just outside the House doors.  The doors 
     of the vehicle fly open as a doctor and nurse emerge.  They're 
     the same two people who cared for Bill Mitchell at the outset 
     of the film.

     It takes a split second for them to whisk out the gurney bed 
     and slam the doors behind them.  They bolt toward the House 
     chamber while the Secret Service stands guard.

168   INT. CHAMBER

     Duane and other Secret Servicemen move the onlookers back as 
     the medical team loads Dave onto the gurney bed and hurry 
     him toward the doors.

169   EXT. HOUSE PARKING LOT

     They emerge a moment or two later with Duane leading the 
     way.

     Dave has been securely fastened to the rolling stretcher 
     while the doctor and nurse hover close...

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     They pop the door of the ambulance.  A crowd of onlookers 
     watches in horror as the body of the President is whisked

     It is pandemonium here as well.  A huge stat team waits for 
     the AMBULANCE as it comes SCREAMING up to the emergency 
     entrance at the back of the hospital.  They fling the doors 
     of the ambulance open as they remove the nearly lifeless 
     body of the President...

     THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY OVER to the passenger's side, 
     REVEALING:

     DAVE

     He sits in a white paramedics outfit complete with hat and 
     name plate.  Dave is wearing his glasses once again and 
     looking decidedly unpresidential.   He glances over at Duane.

                           DAVE
               Well...

                           DUANE
               Well...

     After a beat.

                           DUANE (CONT'D)
               You sure you don't want a lift back 
               home?

                           DAVE
               No thanks.  It's not that far.

     The two men shake hands and Dave reaches for the door.  He 
     holds the same souvenir bag he had on his evening out with 
     Ellen.

                           DUANE
               Dave...

     He pauses and looks back.

                    (quietly)
               Thanks, Duane.

     Dave smiles at his friend, then climbs out of the ambulance, 
     and heads down the street...

172   EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - DIFFERENT ANGLE

     A LIMOUSINE comes SCREECHING up to the curb.  The door flies 
     open and Ellen gets out.  She sees the huge crowd of people 
     at the back of the hospital then looks around the parking 
     lot.  Finally she sees:

     A strange composure envelopes her as she makes a silent 
     decision.  She takes one last look at Dave's receding figure, 
     then turns and runs quickly inside the hospital...

174   EXT. DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE - DAY (WINTER)

     The autumn leaves are all gone now and the SNOW has started 
     to fall.   Christmas decorations hang from lampposts and a 
     Salvation Army Santa is ringing his bell.

                           ANNOUNCER #3 (V.O.)
               ... Bob Alexander and eight other 
               members of the Mitchell Administration 
               were indicted on thirty-four counts 
               of election law violations and 
               obstruction of justice.  Ironically, 
               the indictments came just forty-eight 
               hours after final passage of the 
               Bill Mitchell Jobs Bill, a 
               comprehensive employment program, 
               designed to...

175   EXT. KOVIC TEMPS - DAY

     Snow is falling gently in the street.   The CAMERA BEGINS TO 
     PUSH IN SLOWLY ON the first floor window.  Jerry (Alice's 
     boyfriend) is hanging a large sign in the window that reads:

     "KOVIC FOR ALDERMAN"

176   INT. KOVIC TEMPS

     The place is just as busy as before.  Alice frantically works 
     the phones while three or four women cram the waiting area.

     Murray supervises a couple of campaign workers including 
     Lola from the start of the film.  They stuff envelopes and 
     wear large "KOVIC" hats on their heads.

                           MURRAY
                    (to one of the workers)
               No.  Fold them the long way.  It 
               looks neater.

     ANGLE - DAVE'S INNER OFFICE

     He works the phone, hunched over his desk.

                           DAVE
                    (into the receiver)
               What do you mean, Harry, this woman's 
               fabulous...
                    (beat)
               Oh no, that was a different one...

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
                    (longer beat)
               Well she's changed a lot...
                    (pause)
               Come on, Harry, it's Christmas, the 
               woman needs a job.
                    (beat)
               Well, sure... she can wrap presents... 
               Yeah you bet... Oh, great.

     He pauses for a beat.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Harry, did you get that fund-raising 
               thing I sent you?

     ANGLE - DOORWAY/RECEPTION AREA

     It jars open as a woman steps inside.   Alice barely looks 
     up as the woman, wearing dark glasses and a scarf, moves 
     into the waiting area.

     CLOSER SHOT

     Despite the blue jeans and T-shirt, she looks quite familiar.

     It's Ellen.

     DIFFERENT ANGLE

     Dave moves into the reception area with a huge smile on his 
     face.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               Yes!  We're on a roll now...

     All the women smile up at him.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               It's Christmas time...
                    (a catch phrase)
               .... and everybody works at Christmas 
               time...

     All of a sudden they stop.  Dave looks across the reception 
     area and sees Ellen by the door.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     She takes off her dark glasses and stares at him.  Neither 
     one of them says a word as Dave moves slowly forward with a 
     stunned look on his face.  She smiles at him.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                           ELLEN
               Hi.

                           DAVE
               Hi.

                           ELLEN
                    (indicating her 
                    wardrobe))
               Thought I needed a little change.  
               You like it?

                           DAVE
                    (nodding)
               It's nice.

     He moves a little closer.   They stand face to face.

                           DAVE (CONT'D)
               I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.

                           ELLEN
                    (past it now)
               Yeah, well... It's finally over.

     They are inches apart.   Dave notices Murray and the six 
     other women staring at them in the waiting area.

                           DAVE
                    (quickly)
               C'mere.

177   INT. DAVE'S PRIVATE OFFICE

     Murray stares as he pulls her into his private office and 
     shuts the door.  Ellen throws her arms around his neck as 
     their lips meet in a passionate kiss...

                           DAVE
                    (kissing)
               I never thought I'd...

                           ELLEN
                    (kissing back)
               I know.

                           DAVE
                    (kissing again)
               I missed...

                           ELLEN
                    (kiss)
               ... Me, too.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  132.


     She pulls back and looks at him.

                           ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    (beat)
               So this is it?

                           DAVE
               ... Not exactly the Oval Office.

                           ELLEN
               Oh... I lived with a President.  It 
               isn't any fun.

     Dave gazes into her eyes.

                           DAVE
                    (softer)
               It could be fun.

                           ELLEN
                    (smiling)
               Yeah... It could be fun.

     They come together in another kiss.   Ellen drops her handbag 
     to the floor, as the CAMERA WIDENS OUT ON the bustle of the 
     busy office... Outside on the busy Baltimore street... As we 
     SLOWLY...

     FADE OUT.

                               THE END</tt></font></pre>
