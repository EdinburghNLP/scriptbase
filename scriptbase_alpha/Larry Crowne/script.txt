          FADE IN

                         SUNRISE

                         
          Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as
          promising as, well, this new day...
          Sun is rising over...

                         
          A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse.
          A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with...
          HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge
          commercial building. In fact this kind of building...
          A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of
          low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the
          Consumer Economy...

                         PARKING LOT

                         
          Empty thus far. A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their
          assigned slots far from the entrance. One of those cars is a
          old, not so vintage nor classic convertible...
          KARMANN GHIA -- Belonging to...

                         
          LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that
          rising sun.

          Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his
          un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and
          Company Polo.

          Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the
          cover into place.

          He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the
          asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount.
          He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting
          encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and
          squeezing shoulders...

          Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle
          Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those
          briefs ... hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers...
          helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor -
          clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again.

          Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...

                         

                         

          EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - LATER

          Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into
          pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart
          pen like a Trail Boss...

                         LATER

                         
          That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up-
          chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up.
          A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof
          pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the
          Handicapped Space.

           Buddy. Park there and you'll get a
           ticket.

                          PIZZA KID
           Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in
           sixty seconds.
           (a dozen pizza boxes)
           You guys having a party?

                         

                         

          INT. MEETING ROOM 2 - UNIMART - LATER

          The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices.

                         
          A RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads "Good Luck
          Dorothy Genkos!" The name has been printed over the last
          person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can
          at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete.
          None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for
          DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group.
          Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX,
          STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female).

           4.

                         

                         

                          STRANG
           Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two-
           K a year are history. Who else
           would do us that favor?

                          ANDREWS
           Wish they'd all sail off like her.
           Save us some grief.

                          STRANG
           The "R" Bomb is going to do some
           collateral damage to this place.
          Hurley is shocked!

                          HURLEY
           "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?

                          COX
           Separating the chaff from the
           wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff,
           right?

                          HURLEY

                         

                         

                         

                         
           Chaff is the waste matter, correct.

                         
           When are we restructuring?

                          COX
           Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders.
          Hurley looks sick. She hates this.

                          STRANG
           What say we drop a brick in the
           pond to warn the herd?

                          ANDREWS
           How?

                          STRANG
           Firing someone.

                          COX
           Someone they'd never expect to be
           let go. To look fair. I like it.

                          STRANG
           Like a Team Leader.

                          HURLEY
           Team Leader?

                          STRANG

           5.

                         

                         

                          COX
           Suggestions on who it should be?

                          STRANG
           I say Crowne.

                          HURLEY
           Larry Crowne?
          Strang rolls his eyes.

                         

                          STRANG
           Who else? Avery won't retire. We
           fire him, it's a law suit.
          AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.

                         

                          STRANG (CONT'D)
           Alvarez is about to drop a kid.
           She'll go part time in a week.
          ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.

           Crowne's pink slip will save 'da

                         
           "U" big green backwash.

                          COX
           What Salary Tier is Crowne at?

                          ANDREWS
           Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L.
           bump at the first of the year.

                          COX
           Sweet. We'll need Actionable
           Cause, of course.
          They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."

                         

                          COX (CONT'D)
           How's his review record?

                          HURLEY
           He's a candidate for Employee of
           the Month. His 22nd time.

                          COX
           Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a
           reason...
          Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.

           6.

                         

                         

                          HURLEY
           We could use the Limited Horizons
           strategy.

                          (EXPLAINING)
           Larry will always be passed over
           for Management. He never went to
           college.

                          COX
           You're that familiar with his
           record?

                          STRANG
           She was his squeeze for a few
           weeks, weren't you, Vick?

                          HURLEY
           That was before the New Employee
           Covenants. That you even
           remember...

                          STRANG
           The memory haunts me.

           He'll sock us for severance.

                          STRANG
           Big brick in the pond, though.

                          COX
           Let's call it. Today, end of
           shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu.
          LARRY is dancing up a storm.

                         

                         

          EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift.

                         

                         

          INT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER

          Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is
          fastidious in his work.
          The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no
          attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by.

                          VASQUEZ
           LC Why still here?

           7.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Team Leaders zone departments
           before punching out. It's policy.

                          VASQUEZ
           I mean here here. You just got
           paged to Meeting Room 2.
          The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Probably to clean up after the
           party.

                          VASQUEZ
           Isn't it Employee of the Month Day?
          Larry brightens. That is what it must be.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Speck-tack-alar.
          Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ah, who's counting?
          He flashes his fingers: twenty two!

                         

                         

          INT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME

          Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the
          substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Remember how we saw "The UniMart
           Way" video, Vick? You and me,
           alone in this room, and look at us
           now.
          Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.

                         

                          STRANG
           Cubby. Make tracks.
          The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves

           8.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I think I know what this is about.

                          STRANG
           I don't think you do.

                          COX
           Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So

          Larry is getting out of his car, putting on a good face, and
          heading inside.

                         LATER
          He gets right back into his car.

          INT. FURNITURE PLANET - LATER

          Way back in the rear of the store, behind a false panelling a
          furniture store should be ashamed of, Larry has filled out
          another application and is waiting for someone to give it to.
          A PLANET STAFFER finally shows her head.

           16.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           How do I offer this up to
           Personnel?

                          PLANET STAFFER
           There should be a box to put it in.
          Larry finds a box.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           This?

                          PLANET STAFFER
           No. There should be another box.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           There isn't.

                          PLANET STAFFER
           That's the one, then.
          Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.

           we've got it and we'll keep you in

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Just following up with an in-person
           visit.

           MR. PATTERSON
           Mission accomplished.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You have a great location here.

           MR. PATTERSON
           Not with UniMart half a mile away.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I used to work for UniMart! I
           could spill you some 411.

           MR. PATTERSON
           What's that mean?

           17.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I know their trade secrets.

           MR. PATTERSON
           What secrets? Traffic boosters,
           loss leaders and bait and switch!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           And I'm ready to learn new
           strategies. I'll stop by again so
           you can keep me in mind.

           MR. PATTERSON
           If you won't work Sundays, don't
           bother.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'll work every day.

           MR. PATTERSON
           That's what I already do...
          Mr. Patterson goes back to work as Larry slinks away.

          EXT. RESTAURANT ON RESTAURANT ROW - SAME

          Larry sits in his car. The last thing he wants to do is work
          in a restaurant -- we'll find out why later on. But times
          are tough, no?
          Out he climbs, resigned to fate...

                         

                         

          EXT. BACK OF RESTAURANT #1 - DAY

          By the dumpster, Larry is asking a CHEF on his smoke break if
          they hav op nings.

                         

          INT. RESTAURANT #2 - WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR - DAY

          Now he's asking some HEAD COOK pulling cutlets.

                         

                         

          INT. HUGE KITCHEN OF HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

          Larry is talking to CHEF AMOS, who runs the place.

           18.

                         

                         

                          CHEF AMOS
           Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne.
           I never forget anyone who quits on
           me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           As I recall, I gave my notice and
           worked all my shifts and that was
           12 years ago.

                          CHEF AMOS
           As I recall, I had to hire and
           train a line cook to take your
           place. Walking out doesn't happen
           in a vacuum, you know.

                          (THEN)
           Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a
           job again. But you've been out of
           the business a long time, and look
           around. I don't need you.
          The place is fully staffed and rocking. Larry will not be
          working here.

          Larry is seated at the counter. PERRY pours him coffee as
          RAUL -- the head cook -- is talking from the service window.
          CARLOS and NICK are in the back.

                         

                          RAUL
           You come in two weeks ago I would
           have kissed you on the mouth, but
           Carlos and Nick, they walked in.
           Best I can do? Put you at the top
           of the list.
          Raul goes back to work.

                         

                          PERRY
           Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I
           could help you but Raul runs the
           back.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Not sure I could work here anyway.
           The atmosphere is too pleasant and
           the clientèle too A Number 1.

           No charity today. I got things to

                          PERRY
           Like what?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Nothing. I was just saying that.

          Lamarr comes charging out the rising door and across the
          street.

                          LAMARR
           There's been a yard sale at 1402
           Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky!
           That gives me a monopoly on the
           location! You go yard on me, Larry
           Crowne and I will destroy you.
          He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him.

           No. No, no. I need an all-new

           First thing. Bravo for choosing
           East City College. Never too late
           for an education. Second, you need
           a jolt to the confidence machinery.

          Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of
          heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her
          huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk
          such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus.
          Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is

          STUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too,
          among these 'portable' classrooms that have not moved in 7
          years.

          Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates
          Larry Crowne.
          She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in
          large, shaky-yet-feminine script:

          CARE.

                         
          She underlines it four times.

           While earning a Masters in

          An actual classroom, but in sad shape. In one section sits

          Larry sees her and sits next to her, oblivious to the fact
          that she is cripplingly shy.

          EXT. DERBY COURT - LATER

          Larry is carrying his Flat Screen TV, wires, box and all,
          from his house to Lamarr's garage.
          "Wing Ding Ding!" goes the scooter Lamarr has been working on
          with his tools. He lets it idle as he takes the TV.

                          LAMARR
           Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet.

                          (SHOWING HIM)
           Gas. Brake. Light's busted.
           Tires are low. You'll need a
           special license.
          Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved).

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           All I need is the open road.
          Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.

                         

                          LAMARR
           You break it, you bought it.

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - DEN - EVENING

          DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a
          taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own
          books line the shelves.
          When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Well, hey! Who's home early!
          He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe.
          Mercedes calls from the other room.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

          He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk.

          Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.

           First day of term calls for a
           celebration!

           You'd think so.

           Why wouldn't I believe you?

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I was composing, Mercy. That's
           what I do all day.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You were looking at porn.
          She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.
          Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw
          some erotica. I'm a man, I admit
          it.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
          Took you a while.

           33.

                         

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           It's barely porn. I'm not hiding
           it.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yes you are.
          She bangs her head.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Brain freeze.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Don't chug. Sip.

                          (THEN)
           Everyone hides something.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I have no secrets from you. I
           share the whole miserable slate.

                          DEAN TAINOT

                          (SERIOUS EYES)
           You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X
           expecting me to pretend I don't
           know or I don't care. I do both
           and don't like it.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           It may look like I don't work hard
           around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm
           just a guy who's a guy being a guy
           when you're not around...
          She walks away.

                         

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           And walking away is great for a
           relationship...

          It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a

          Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her
          chair and into her drink. This is where she goes when she
          thinks/drinks.
          Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last
          point.

          The streets are not yet crowded with traffic.

                         
          A MOTORCYCLE RIDER pilots a STATE OF THE ART STREET MACHINE:
          machine helmet, leather pants and jacket, radio in the
          helmet, saddlebags, windscreen. Probably a gynecologist.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERSECTION - SAME

          The cyclist pulls up right next to:

          passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!'

                          LARRY CROWNE
           School. College. I'm a student.
           What do you do?

                          RIDER
           I'm a gynecologist.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day'
           but that would be stating the

           35.

                         

                         
          The light changes.

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
           You take care.
          As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he
          stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.

                         

                         

          EXT. E.C.C.C. SCOOTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Larry is trying to work the kick stand of his scooter. He is
          not yet practiced at the thing. Another scooter rrives.

                          TALIA
           Where'd you get the Hot Wheels?
          Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails
          to recognize her from Econ prime.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           That machine's a classic.

           Got me here for a nickel's worth of

                         
           gas.

                          TALIA
           You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I am?

                          TALIA
           That class is straining my coconut.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           It's only been one day

                          TALIA
           Didn't know you scooted.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           New to the sport.

                          TALIA
           (pulls out mobile phone)
           Give me your number. I'll
           introduce you to like-minded
           enthusiasts.

                          (THEN)
           Name please?

           36.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.

                          TALIA
           'Larry'? I don't think so. I used
           to be Kathleen but one day I looked
           in the mirror and saw a girl named
           Talia.
           (then in her phone)
           Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check
           your texts and we'll do us some
           scooting.

                          (THEN)
           Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a
           polo shirt into khakis makes you
           look like a cop.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Not much fashion sense.

                          TALIA
           I know! Gotta change that...
          Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and
          doesn't want to be late again.

           Gotta go!

                          TALIA
           Then get going!!
          Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...

                         

                         

          INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER

          Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit
          hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls
          from her Thermo-cup.
          Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes.

                         
          In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is
          demonstrating an exercise for her speech.

                          CALIMERIS
           With the push-up added, the 4-count
           Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie
           and works out the pecs and biceps.
           It's an all-in-one exercise perfect
           for Cheerleader conditioning. The

                          6-COUNT BURPIE

          The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a
          fan.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           We now all know how to Burpie.
           Thank you.

                          (THEN)
           Who's next?
          No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to...

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
           Make me the bad guy.

                          (HER ROSTER)
           Ms. Crowne?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You mean me?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Mr. Crowne. My bad.
          Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.

                         
          Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.'

                         
          He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue.

           Go.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           My presentation will be on the
           subject of a very particular
           procedure. "How to make French
           Toast", but I'll speak English...
          Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks
          to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...

           M classes were once filled with
           e rnest young men ready to learn
           all I had to teach them. Cute boys
           fresh out of High School who all
           had crushes on me from day one. Now
           look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound
           for jail. Mack. Treating college
           like another tour of combat.

          Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking,
          only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)...

           Busik, I am going to kill you. You

           in at this ungodly hour for 2
           minutes on French toast?
          Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about
          Larry.
          She is a stone face.

          Larry is taking notes, beside Lala, when his phone vibrates.
          He flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble.
          On his phone a message: TALIA: "Scoot?"

                         
          It takes a moment for him to understand what is going on.

          Larry looks as instructed. He sees Talia, phone in hand,

                         LATER
          Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia
          walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.

                          TALIA
           Hey Monkey!
          Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses
          him back. Larry sinks a little.

           40.

                         

                         
          It only figures Talia would have a boyfriend like Dell Gordo.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           This is Lance Corona. Classmate and
           good guy, so far.

                          DELL GORDO
           Dell Gordo. You want to ride with
           us?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Why not.
          There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry,
          but then Dell starts to snap his fingers --
          SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all
          snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.

                          TALIA
           Snap along, Lance or you can't join
           the gang.
          Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...

           Okay. You're in for a trial run.
          And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.

                          STAN
           Not many of these '66 Wasps left
           around. They had low torque.
           How's the torque?
          He means Larry's scooter.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I just bought it and ride around.
          Someone yells "Saddle up!"

                         

                          TALIA
           Stan knows engines and junk.

                          TALIA
           We ride, Monkey!
          Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from
          Talia-on-the-heart.

           41.

                         

                         
          The squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with
          Larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd...

          They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe.
          Swaying... turning... slow-motion sometimes... elegant
          always.
          They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas...
          rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to
          do...

          As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye
          the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts
          in the parking lot.
          He misses that place...

           No one should ever buy clothes off
           the internet. You have to feel the

           That can't happen, Larry.
           I'm extended. I've put a deposit
           down on the first vacation I've had
           in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as

                          DENISE
           That's not my problem. Take out a
           loan on the house or something.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I tried. I'm too much of a risk.

                          DENISE
           Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't
           want to open up the whole lawyer
           thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks,
           doesn't it? I appreciate the

          Mack is at the podium giving a presentation with his Star
          Wars Action figures.

                          MACK
           These are not toys. Nobody 'plays'
           with these. These are kept behind
           glass, so no way am I passing them
           around today.
          Mercedes TALKS to us and HERSELF.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Wait a ding dong minute.
           (counts the heads)
           1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is
           missing! Who cut my class?
          She lets slip OUT LOUD:

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Where's Larry Crowne?!
          Everyone looks at her.

           60.

                         

                         

                          MACK
           Guess Larry's out today.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Anyone know why?

                          MACK
           He didn't call me.
          Ad-libs: no one knows why Larry is out.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I don't believe this! Ditching me?
           He ditched me? Not okay. Larry
           Crowne, you are on my Shit List.
          Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat.
          Speaking quietly in their seats...

                         

                          DIBIASI
           Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a
           Teach-ee.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          CALIMERIS

                         
           When you were out last week, she
           said nothing. I think she has a
           crush on Larry Crowne.

                          PINEDO
           I do too.
           (off their looks)
           He's a nice man.
          Mack speaks up.

                         

                          MACK
           Should I continue?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yes. Tell us more about your man
           dolls.
          Mack is humiliated now.

                         

                          MACK
           I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba
           Fett...

          INT. ECON 1 - LATER

          Dr. Matsutani is in mid-lecture when Larry comes in, late.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                          (QUIETLY)
           I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani.
           May I still sit in the class?

           DR. MATSUTANI
           This is college, Mr. Crowne. The
           only thing you can't do is smoke in
           the building. Hand over your
           phone.

                          (LARRY DOES)
           I'm going to ask a question in a
           moment. I want someone other than
           you to answer it - I don't care if
           the silence is positively Arctic.
          Larry moves to take a seat.

                         
          Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him
          "What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

                         
           This brings us to a dreaded task to
           every corporate entity. What is
           the purpose of semi-annual re-
           purposing? Anyone?

                          (THEN)
           Anyone?
          He waits. And waits. And waits. Matsutani stares fear into
          the hearts of all but Larry.

          EXT. E.C.C.C. - LATER

          Mercedes Tainot is crossing campus when she sees Larry.
          Talia is moving around his hair, showing it to a SCOOTER
           QUAD HAIR STYLIST. Lala is weighing in with her opinion on
          Larry's hair .

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Is that Larry Crowne!?

                          (HE STOPS)
           You have a lot of nerve showing
           your face on campus after ditching
           my class!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not
           miss another class, this I vow.

           63.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne.
           You'll lead off next assignment
           with three minutes on a personal
           first. A story, with details, not
           a laundry list or slide show. And,
           as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to
           hear about the first time you got
           laid.
          She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Or the most recent.
          Talia laughs out loud!

                         

                          TALIA
           That woman is one clenched fist of
           fury.

           That makes me cranky, too.

           Without a workout in the Inner
           Sanctum a few times a week I can't

          Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's
          wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.

           Nothing wrong with a campus
           romance. Otherwise life is what?
           Breakfast work, coffee, school,
           lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk,
           Mexican food, a movie, glass of
           wine or two then bed? That's not
           living.

           SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST
           Not without some smooching time.

                          TALIA
           Bet she'd give you an A plus.

           More complimentary coffee?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Complimentary coffee is usually
           lousy.

                          LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

           67.

                         

                         

          INT. MERCEDES' CAR - MORNING - RAIN

          The windows are fogging up. Frances and Mercedes sip take-
          out coffee and eat glazed rings of death.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           I never read them.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Who did? I'm married to an ex-
           teacher turned blogger with two
           books in print. And oh, yes, he has
           the libido and internet access of a
           13-year-old.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           I had a boyfriend who owned every
           movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d
           hear a DVD go into the playe an
           knew what I was going to be doing in
           a half-hour.
          Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia
          with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           Once more to Divorce Court to
           cashier a spouse, line my cloak
           with alimony and do myself homage.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to
           Roderigo.
          Talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Why can't all my students be like
           y u?

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Because, as I learned in your
           class, I am one of a kind.
          Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her.
          He never sees Mercedes or Frances.

           FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)
           Hey, that guy's in your class.
          Mercedes wipes fog off the window.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           68.

                         

                         

          P.O.V.
          Talia is talking to the Donut Shop Lady, selecting crullers
          and old-fashioneds.

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a
           leash!
          Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           That's why he's in college! To get
           laid!

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           It happens.
          Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of
          donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a
          ring of sweet into his mouth.
          Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           You are everything that's wrong
           with America, Larry Crowne!
          They did not hear her.

                         

                         

          INT SPEE H 217 - MORNING
          Larry is at the podium, prepping his "Personal First"
          presentation as the class comes in. He is dressed as Talia
          styled him.

                          DIBIASI
           Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know
           you were gay. You've gone all
           Project Runway on us.
          Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is
          oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the
          room as the class goes quiet.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Should I begin?
          Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'

                         

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
          first crossing of the Equator...

           69.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           (talking to herself in the MOVIE

                          DEVICE WAY)
           Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.

                          (THEN)
           Look at the new pants. They
           actually fit. And that jacket is
           'smart'. Did Busik put Larry
           Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An
           old goat dressed like lamb.

                          (THEN)
           Of course! It's that doe-eyed
           young thing he's been wearing on
           his sleeve. Dressing like he's
           half his age. Give me a shotgun!
           I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now!

                          (THEN)
           Am I being unfair? I mean, if I
           were single and some young buck
           took to me, wouldn't I be inclined
           to diddly-dally?
          She looks at Dibiasi, who has snuck iPod earbuds onto his
          head, is mouthing the words and playing air guitar.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The class erupts in l ughter. Mercedes wasn't paying

                         

                         

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

                         
           Youth wouldn't be the only
           requirement, of course.

                         
          attention to hear Larry's bon mot.

                          DIBIASI
           (jerking out buds)
           What? What he say?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Unless you're looking at a chart,
           you don't even know the Equator
           when you cross it...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           A repackaged Larry Crowne won't
           fool me. Shame on you. Going
           after jail bait, you criminal.
           Insert Viagra joke here...

                          (THEN)
           herself at you... No. Don't let
           up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY!
          Polite applause. Mercedes pretends she heard every word.

           70.

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Anyone recall anything from that?

                          PINEDO
           That Larry believed there were
           signs on posts marking the Equator.

                          CALIMERIS
           And that, when it's a first time,
           they make the rookies dress in drag
           and sing Abba songs?
          Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.

                         

                          MACK
           Larry worked on an Aircraft
           Carrier! Night Carrier Landings
           are the trickiest flying in world.
          Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           That was a memorable nugget.

           Larry was stationed in Panama! My
           father is from Panama!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Mr. Koss to the lectern, please.
          More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech.
          Mercedes heard none of them...

                         

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Talia is riding alone. She slows at a TATTOO PARLOR...

                         

                         

          INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

          Larry bangs out orders.

                         
          Raul sits at the butchers block, sipping coffee, observing
          his new kitchen staffer.

                         

                         

          EXT. PERFECT SPACE - DAY

          An empty store right next to the Tattoo Parlor. Talia is
          looking through the window

           71.

                         

                         
          A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT

          DOOR ASK FOR MAURICE."
          Talia smiles. Her mobile rings its unique ringtone.

                         
          STAN: "Scoot! Webster and Palm!"

                         

                         

          INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his
          studies out -- trying to do two jobs at the same tim
          His mobile phone vibrates.
          TALIA: "Scoot?"

                         
          He punches in

                         
          "Can't. Job."

                         
          He goes back to his studies just as another order comes up.
          Then his phone vibrates again.
          TALIA: "Job? Sob! Coming!"

          Talia and the scooter gang pull in.

                         

                         

          INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

          In they pour, sizing up the place for a hangout. Talia, Stan -
          - minus Dell Gordo -- and others sit at the counter where
          they can see Larry.

           You make it sound so simple!!
          Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead
          with kisses.

           Well, back to work!

                         

          EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

          Dean is opening the car door for Mercedes, putting on the
          class act for a night out.
          He laughs at a feeble joke we can't hear. The guy is trying.

                         

          LATER - NIGHT

                         
          They come right out the same door. They've argued and drank
          all through the meal. Dean carries extra cheesecake home in
          a dessert box. And, oh, they've been drinking.

           Work my ass off all night trying to
           get f i in' smile out of you!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm smiling...

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Like The Joker after three Apple
           Martinis.

           If they help, they help.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           We can't even have a Date Night
           now? You can't even chillax for
           one meal?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           "Chillax?" Did you use the word
           "chillax?" That come from your
           Bloggers Thesaurus?

           You lie to me, Dean. Every day.
           You. Lie. To. Me.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You looking for a whole new man,
           Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to
           transform into Ultraman to make you
           happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I
           put up with you and complain about
           nothing.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm not complaining. I'm stating
           the truth. I teach while you
           pretend to work.

           Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to

                          (THEN)
           I know what's really pissing you
           off. I like big titties. And you
           don't have any.
          Yeow. A line has been crossed. A big, ugly line has just
          been crossed. Even Dean knows it.

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Maybe I should take that back.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           LET ME OUT OF THIS FUCKING CAR!!!

                         

                         

          EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

          A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on
          their first date. It's gone well.

           76.

                         

                         

                          JANET
           As soon as I saw you, I said, "I
           want to go out with that man."

                          TONY
           What did you say when I asked you
           out?

                          JANET
           I said "Yes." You were there,
           remember?

                          TONY
           I saw you and I thought "I would be
           a lucky guy if she'd go out with
           me."

                          JANET
           Yes you are.

                          TONY
           Honestly, this is about as good a
           first date goes, isn't it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          JANET

                         
           Disaster looms on most first dates,
           but I'm talking to you like you're a
           friend I want to make out with.

                          TONY
           Hold that thought.
          Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.

                         
          Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops.

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I take it back. I take it back.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Drive, asshole! Drive away!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I've been drinking, too.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Drive straight til you hit a cliff
           on the coastline!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You win! I'm letting you win!
           Everything you say is right and

          WIN!

           77.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With
           a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Screw you, you washboard!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Oh, chillax!!!

           Please enter your destination.
          Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock
          and hurls it at him.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
          Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           The jerk who just deserted me? My
           husband of 4 friggin' years!
          She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know
          what to do with each other now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER


                         
          Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would
          like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She
          sits and removes her shoes.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I loved these shoes once. Stupid
           shoes.
          She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does
          cry, for so any reasons.
          In the distance, we hear...

                         
          The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time
          'Scoot'.
          All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and
          Talia.
          Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the
          bus stop. She slows.

           78.

                         

                         

                          TALIA
           Lance! Chick alert!
          Larry is beside her. They stop.

                         

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           You are not going to believe how
           Fate meets cute!
          She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.

                         

                         BUS BENCH

                         
          Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to
          her.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ms. Tainot?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           No.
          He takes off his helmet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         
           Larry Crowne.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Jesus Christ.

                          TALIA
           And I've been calling you 'Lance'.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Do you need a ride? Hop on.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           And bust up your romp in the glen
           with Bambi?

                          TALIA
           Hey. Bambi was a boy.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I was heading home.

                          (TO TALIA)
           Right? We're done scooting?

                          TALIA
           Not me. I love riding in the
           night. Magic happens.

                          (TO LANCE)

           79.

                         

                         
          Away Talia scoots to catch up with the gang.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           What do men see in irritating free
           spirits?
          Mercedes starts walking.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Seriously. I offer you a ride.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Seriously. I don't want one.
          Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I've yet to give anyone a lift on
           this but I think I can get you home
           with a scraped elbow, worst case.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts
           black boil up from my soul. Major

                          LARRY CROWNE
           An attractive woman like you
           walking alone is a dumb idea.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I need a man flirting with me right
           now like I need a dog crapping on my
           lawn. I'm hoofing it.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           In those shoes?
          Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           A man who notices shoes.

                          (GIVING UP)
           All right. I'll be your Cycle
           Slut.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Put this on.

                          (HIS HELMET)
           Strap your legs round my engine and

           80.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It won't be a terrible thing if you
           kill us both.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ain't you a ball of fun?
          Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.

                         

                         IN MOTION

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Are you really going to go this
           slow?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I do want to survive this night.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Fine. I have time to window shop.
           Oh look, a sale on tires at
           AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox.
           I've never noticed their perfect
           design and colo scheme. This is

                         

                         

                         

                         
           so slow a cat could knock us over.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. INTERSECTION - MINUTES LATER.

          Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is
          singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal".

                         

          EXT. STREET - RIDING SHOT - LATER - ON THE SCOOTER

          Larry shouts over his shoulder.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Where am I taking you?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Down to Portola and left to
           Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo.
           Right on Palermo till I yell stop.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I may use this as a presentation in
           class.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Try it and you'll flunk.
          I am joking.

           81.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I like your class. You're making
           us all do things we never thought
           we could.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Put the shovel away and just get me
           home, 'kay?
          Up ahead, flashing lights.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Hail our City's Finest.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Someone's getting pinched...
          A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a
          Drunk Driver.
          It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a
          test kit.
          Mercedes starts laughing.

                         
          As they pass the crime scene, Dean is being put into the back

                         

                         

                         

                         
          of the Prowler, cuffed...

                         
          Mercedes' laugh fills the night as they putt-putt along.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Measure his dick, officer! He's
           too diminutive to drive!

                          (THEN)
           Tiny dick loser!
          Larry doesn't know what to make of that.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Bad night for that guy.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Best night I've had in years!
           Drive on, McDuff!

                         

                         

          EXT. CEDAR HILLS TOWNHOMES - NIGHT

          In through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is

           82.

                         

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

          Larry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She
          doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Unit 114.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Thanks for the ox-cart ride.
          Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I can see the Alarm Pad. I know
           the code. But my hands aren't
           working.

                          (THEN)
           Help me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You don't want to give me your pass
           code.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           Just hold my hand up to the
           numbers. I'll manage from there.
          Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Look away now.

                          (HE DOES)
           Two two two two. Pound.
          Larry heard every word.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car.
           The key please? It's buried in
           that plant.
          Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           This it?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Why I think it is!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'll get the door for you
          Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.

           83.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Take one step inside and I call
           security.
          Larry steps away from the door.

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           And forget this ever happened.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           This whole sorry chapter tonight.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You passing up Gidget for a flat
           old coot like me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What are you talking about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           What, you have no short-term
           memory?
          Larry has been tying to be polite.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           When I say 'what', it means I get
           it and have already purposefully
           forgotten everything. Call it
           irony.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant
           lands in the drunk tank while
           Goofus scoots me home.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Goodnight, Ms. Tainot.
          She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not
           see that?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I assumed you preferred Ms

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           When we presume we make a pretty
           pair of asses of me and you or
           something like that.

                          (THEN)
           Why aren't you married?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           That's a long story and it's late.

                          (THEN)
           My helmet?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Help yourself.
          She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might
          kiss right now.
          Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking
          guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I noticed something on the ride.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                          WHAT

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                          IT MAY
           You smell good.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Thanks.
          He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head.
          be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Do you have a crush on me? Single
           student. Unattainable teacher. It's
           common.
          Larry has no idea what to say.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           We all have crushes on you. Even
           the gals.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You want to make out with me, you
           can. I know I'm not a third rate

           My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5
           years.
          Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He
          shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot.
          Bang.

                         
          It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and
          everything.
          Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept
          at it, too.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Wow...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Pretty dang good. I still got it,
           no?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Yes, you do..

                          (THEN)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           In you go.

                         
           (Mercedes goes in)
           Close the door.

                          (SHE DOES)
           Lock it!
          Larry hears the sound of the bolt. He walks away.

          Mercedes leans against the door. What did she just do????

                         

           LARRY CROWNE (O.S.)
           Goodnight, whoever you are!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Whoever I am...

                         

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

          Larry wistfully starts his bike, looking back at the door.
          He will not forget that kiss or this night. He drives off.

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

          A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he

           86.

                         

                         
          He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his
          world gets much more complicated.

          P.O.V.

                         
          All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the
          top of the heap, his computer. Turned on and showing porn

           Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...

          Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally
          hungover.
          As she straightens up, her eye catches...

                         

                         LARRY CROWNE

                         
          On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking.

                         
          She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
          memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that

                         

                         

                         

                         
          direction.

          Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is
          caught by surprise when..
          He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be
          uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar.
          Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last
          night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a
          birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
          Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud.
          Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
          Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the
          head.
          Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...

          Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around
          to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance
          before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet'
          with Larry.
          Then she sees her.

          Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs
          and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry
          with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his
          waist and affection in her eyes.

                         MERCY
          Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't
          understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a
          minute or two.

          away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.

          INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY

          Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed
          a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is
          looking at Larry.
          Larry is listening to Lala with delight.

                         

                          PINEDO
           Seeing them -- the Northern Lights,
           the Aurora Borealis -- should have
           been beyond me, but I was a little
           girl in Coach class still awake, a
           window seat, a moonless night
           somewhere over Greenland with a
           shimmering curtain of emerald,
           gossamer light dancing just for me.

                          (THEN)
           That is something I will remember
           forever.
          The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala,
          who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who
          rises in applause for the once quiet classmate.
          Then the applause is over.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI

                         
           That was a knockout speech, Lala.
           Made the news. Caused riots
           downtown. School's out til 2019.
          The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and
          head ou .

           Mr. Crowne? A moment please?

                          CALIMERIS
           Why doesn't she just throw herself
           at him?

                          PINEDO
           This is bordering on harassment
           now.

                          DIBIASI
           Quiet down. I'm watching the TV
           show...

                          MACK
           Why doesn't this ever happen to me?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I need a few moments alone with Mr.
           Crowne thank you.

                          DIBIASI
           Move along folks. Privacy's a
           right in this great nation of ours.

                          MACK
           You want I should close this door,
           lock it, and barricade it so you
           won't be disturbed??
          We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           How are the Triplets? Groggy,
           Puffy, and Grumpy.
          He means the hangover.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Last night was a confluence of too
           many things happening in too short

                         

                         

                         

                         
           a time span.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Last i ht? Let's see, what was I
           doing? Studying some. Working
           some. Can't recall. I've forgotten
           everything that happened last night
           as best a gentleman can.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I had no right to judge you or your
           relationships. Date who you want.
          Larry has no idea what that means.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           But what happened last night --
           between adults -- was
           inappropriate. If gossip were to
           circulate, the problem could be
           more than just embarrassing. My
           status as a professor could be
           tarnished.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I wouldn't want that.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
          happened before.

           With parking attendants. Strangers
           at parties when I've had a bit too
           much of the demon rum. This was the
           first time with a student.

                          (THEN)
           I hope the entire thing will be
           forgotten.
          Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Sure. Nothing happened. At all.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           So there will be no bravado among
           you and your pals?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           None.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Thank you, Mr. Crowne.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                         

                         

                         
           I'd better scurry along to Dr.

                         
           Matsutani's class. I hope I don't
           have this same conversation with
           him.
          Larry leaves - a good mood ruined...
          Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark
          glasses?

                         

                         

          EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

          Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play
          down the street. They run back and forth in front of them
          with a soccer ball.
          They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light
          up.

                          LAMARR
           Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.

                          (THEN)
           See? Works.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I have to sell my car.
          Put a new top on it.

           91.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           If I could afford a new top I could
           afford to keep it.

                          LAMARR
           What's the job paying you?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Half my UniMart salary.

                          LAMARR
           You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as
           dirt.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm looking back on the year Denise
           left as the good old days.

                          LAMARR
           Hang in there, neighbor.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Everyone keeps saying that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LAMARR

                         
           I was in the same spot. Look what
           happened.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           The odds of two people on the same
           street winning the lottery are
           worse than one person on the street
           winning the lottery.

                          LAMARR
           I read how the universe is
           expanding, Larry, taking us along
           with it. That is a wild concept to
           grasp, but what it means is, we all
           have to hold on tight sometimes to
           get to where we're going to be.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                          (THE PIPE)
           This thing must be making me dizzy.
           What?

                          LAMARR
           Keep your grip. You'll be okay.
           It's like the wife always says...
          Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a

           92.

                         

                         

                          LAMARR (CONT'D)
           A woman with a measuring tape?
           That's money in my pocket.
          A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his
          pipe flying.

                         

                         

          EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - DAY

          Hardly any cars. Shopping carts are herded into their corral
          by... former Team Leader Larry Crowne.

          P.O.V.

                         
          The place looks different. Shabby. Unkempt. Understaffed.

                         
          He recognizes no one.

          No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by
          Owner' signs. And, he can't help it: he straightens out

          Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her

          EXT. A PARK - DAY

          Trees. A picnic table. And Mercedes Tainot writing
          individual words on pages of a steno book.
          After each word, she folds each page many times and puts it
          in a basket.
          Up walks Dean Tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful.

           Hi.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Thanks for coming.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           No notice. No preamble. Just an
           email and a google map.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I knew you'd be on the computer.

           Point made.

                          (THEN)
           So. What up.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Are we making a mistake here?

                          DEAN TAINOT

           94.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Point made. We could change
           things. We could start right now.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           We could. Why should we?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Because we have history, Dean. But
           first, my thoughts... I've got to
           address drinking. I should be
           able to comprehend and respond to
           both sides of our conversations. And
           the morning shower should be
           refreshing, not a hangover cure.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I'd like that too.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Really?

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You're not a pleasant woman after a

           to be survived.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Okay. Now, you.
          Dean is caught short.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I see. I'm what this is all about.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           There are plenty of items on the
           relationship agenda but let's start
           here.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You're talking about you but you
           really mean me.

                          (THEN)
           I am not yelling or begging or
           saying you have to stop doing
           anything. So you don't get to
           either.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm not saying that.

           95.

                         

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           We've both been here before. Why
           prolong the process? White flag! I
           give up. This ain't working.

                          (THEN)
           I'll sign papers and checks, see if
           there's enough for a cool sports
           car as a reward for the last few
           years and eventually I will be fine
           and you will too. But I am never
           once going to look at myself as
           another poor divorced guy who could
           still be married if only he had
           done the mea culpa bit for all his
           faults.

                          (THEN)
           I just now came up with that, and
           it is going to be my next posting.
          He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself.

                         

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I don't think there is anything
           else to talk about. Do you?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Mercedes looks at him. She has been a fool...

          paper, and drinking. Alone. Not good.

                         

                         

          EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING

          The sign reads "FINALS WEEK: ENROLL FOR SPRING QUARTER."

                         

                         

          INT. SPEECH 217 - MORNING

          She is in the front of the class with a small box. Hungover?
          A bit, yes...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Here I have surprise topics.
           Friday, in a Lightning Round, you
           must wax on that topic for 2
           minutes without pause, repetition,
           or lack of charm. No notes. One
           visual aid.

                          (THEN)
           Ms Pinedo Draw

           96.

                         

                         
          Ms. Pinedo pulls a paper from the box.

           MS. PINEDO
           'Potatoes?'

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Spuds. Can't wait.
          Dibiasi draws a paper.

                         

                          DIBIASI
           'Disraeli'? What is that?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Who is that?

                          DIBIASI
           It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done.
          Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit
          uncomfortable in class since the recent events.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           'Consumerism'.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           That's supposed to say 'Communism.'

                          LARRY CROWNE
           The handwriting is loopy. Looks
           like 'Consumerism'.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism.
          Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.

                         

                          CALIMERIS
           'Malpity Hoople.'

                          (THEN)
           What's this say?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           No idea. Just pick another.

                         

                         

          INT. ECON 1 -- LATER

          Dr. Matsutani is going on. Larry is looking for Talia, who
          is not in class.

           97.

                         

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI

                          (HIS BOOK))
           At the end of each chapter is a
           study guide. Master those and you
           will have mastered my book. Master
           my book and you will take over the
           world.
          He laughs demonically.

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
           By now you should be laughing with
           me.
          Larry can't believe Talia is not there...

                         

                         

          EXT. TALIA'S NEW STORE - LATER

          Larry scoots up. She is inside arranging a "Coming Soon!"
          window display. Dell Gordo, Stan, and the Squad are all
          inside building shelves and racks.
          She comes out of the store.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          TALIA

                         
           You digging what you see?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You missed Matsutani's class.
           Review for the final.

                          TALIA
           I'm done w th college.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What? Why?

                          TALIA
           Because I'm going into business.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in
           school. Don't throw away your
           education.

                          TALIA
           And don't drink and drive or do
           drugs and quit smoking and eat
           vegetables. I don't. I stopped.
           I did. I do.

                          LARRY CROWNE

           98.

                         

                         

                          TALIA
           Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice
           gave us free tattoos. I wanted
           something in Japanese so check this
           out.
          She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two
          Japanese characters.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           That one says 'courage'. That one
           says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit.
          Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his
          gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Japanese characters go the other
           way and that says Soy Sauce.

                          TALIA
           Oh shut up.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                         

                         

                         
           It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce.

                         
           Quitting school is for dopes.
          It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.

                          TALIA
           Be here for our Grand Opening!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Might not make it. I have finals!

                         OPEN SKY

                         
          Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.

                         

                         

          EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY

          He is pounding the FOR SALE sign into his front lawn.

                         
          Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new VW Bug with a COUPLE in
          the back seat. They get out and Larry nods as he waves them
          to the door.
          He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the
          kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street.
          It's all over...

           99.

                         

                         

          EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car.

                         

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           This place anonymous enough?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           As long as alcohol's out of my
           grasp.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           They have good pie, they say.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Great. Sugar can replace tequila
           in my bloodstream, my thighs, and
           the folds in my neck.
          They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible
          Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY

          OWNER."

           FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           So. You're a mess.

          INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

          They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yep.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           You'd think leggy blondes like us
           would be impervious, right?
          At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the
          kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee.
          Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.

                         

                          PERRY
           Ladies. Bring an appetite?

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           The mark of a restaurant is their
           Key Lime pie.
          Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.

                         

                          PERRY

           100.

                         

                         

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           No Key Lime?

                          PERRY
           Cream pies I got.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Boston Cream?

                          PERRY
           Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady,
           you're killing me here.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.

                          PERRY
           Ma'am?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'll have the French Toast.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           French Toast?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           (on the menu)
           Breakfast all day.
          Perry leaves to put in the order.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           You won't believe how far I fell on
           the Hooch-o-meter.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           I have seen it happen a time or
           two.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I kissed a boy.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           When, third grade?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           One of my students.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           You Hoor.

                          (THEN)
           Gimme the friggin' details! He's
           not a minor is he?

           101.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Older than me.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Hugh Hefner in your class? What
           went down?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           He sort of... rescued me. And...
           he smelled nice.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           He a fireman who bakes bread?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I wanted to be kissed so asked if he
           wanted to and he did.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Bold. Who is he?

                         KITCHEN

                         
          Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite
          out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          PERRY

                         
           You're slipping, Larry.

                          (THE TOAST)
           Lady says it's not French Toast as
           she knows it.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           She's insane.

                          PERRY
           Take it up with her.
          Larry heads out of the kitchen.

                         

                          PERRY (CONT'D)
           No shouting, okay? This is a
           family friendly establishment.

                         BOOTH

                         
          Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a
           problem with your order?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           102.

                         

                         
          Knock Larry over with a feather.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Mrs. Tainot.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

                          (TO MERCEDES)
           The student of yours!?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           This is Larry Crowne.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           There's no way in creation I screw
           up French Toast.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It was fine, actually.

                          (THEN)
           I wanted to see if it was really
           you cooking back there. And say,
           howdy. Howdy doody.
          During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of
          Larry -- to find out how he smells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

                         
           Ready for the final?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You'll be the judge of that.
          The is a beat of silence.

                         

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
           So, your meal is satisfactory?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Absolutely.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Would you let my boss know so I
           don't lose this job?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yes indeed.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Look at the men in my life.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Blame it on the booze... and
           collect yourself.

          The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around
          and around and around the block that he will soon leave.
          He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS
          bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards
          and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           What a difference from day one. I
           must be a better teacher than I
           thought.

                          (THEN)
           Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris
           stopped up-talking. Lala you can't
           shut up. Mack spoke about
           Australia for three minutes and
           mentioned kangaroos only twice. And
           Larry Crowne...
          Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his
          UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to
          the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I was tough on him. But he learned
           fast. How he connected the Circle
           of Sales to the expanding universe
           is impressive as hell. I'll never
           forget about the Value Index now.
           He gave a perfect speech.

                          (THEN)
           And... He's polite. Instead of
           fighting me off that night, what
           does he do but kisses me one and
           then all but tucks me in. What kind
           of guy does that to a loopy tramp
           like me? He could have ravaged me.
           I misread this guy and if I had a
           brain I'd find a way to steal him
           away from that cutie pie and keep
           him for myself. I wonder if he'd
           like that, if he would... What did
           I just say?

                          (THEN)
           What did I just say about Larry
           Crowne?
          The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that
          last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each
          other. The men stifle laughs.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm so sorry. Please go on.

           Thank you... If it was the romance

          They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her
          name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her.
          Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to
          pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.

           I hope you continue your education.
           Back at East City. You've made
           such a good start.

                          LARRY CROWNE

          They look at each other.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                          LARRY CROWNE
           In my old job, I'd have steered you
           to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie
           interface is clumsy and the menu
           needs too many inputs.
          He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It was working fine. Then I think
           I pressed too many buttons.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ah. The Auto On Feature is
           engaged. Menu. Select. Features.
           Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes.
           On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back.
           Back. Back. Exit.
          While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could
          of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears.
          And smelled him.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Seemed like years and years.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           All better now. Should be able to
           find your way.
          Nothing to do now but say goodbye.

                         
          They hear a pounding.

                         
          Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is
          over.

          head count.
          Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one,
          again.
          Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...

           down time. Don't you?

           Larry Crowne is taking six units
           from me, devouring the material
           like a starving man.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Larry's enrolled?

           He's continuing his education and
           tells me it is because of you.
           That your class changed his life.

          In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.
          Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.

                         
          Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly
          opens the door.
          The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny
          flat, but she can make out...
          Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.
          Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.

                         
          When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells
