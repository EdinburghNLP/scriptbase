<b>                             EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT
</b>
                             November 14, 2002

<b>
</b>

<b>FADE IN:
</b>




<b>EXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK
</b>
Glimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against
the tide of time.
Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen
against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns.
FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees.




<b>INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
</b>
Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite
darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like
atomized ether.
There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.
DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --




<b>FINAL CELL
</b>
A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying.
He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he
scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year,
the spoon finally breaks through.




<b>INT. NARROW CHANNEL
</b>
Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a
dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a
shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS
open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER.




<b>INT. PRISONER'S CELL
</b>
The tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the
wall, then billows outward like a sail.




<b>INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER
</b>
pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans
the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates.
And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b>

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                       2.
</b>




<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light.
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through.
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it
out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a
Nazi flag.
At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches
long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.




<b>MYSTERIOUS POV
</b>
From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else.
Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.




<b>PRISONER
</b>
starts toward the way out.




<b>INT. PRISONER CORRIDOR
</b>
The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one
-- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the
wall, revealing the hole.




<b>INT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS
</b>
ALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush
through.




<b>INT. NARROW CHANNEL
</b>
Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight.




<b>EXT. PRISON - NIGHT
</b>
SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous
structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for
the trees on the other side of the wall.

<b>                                           (CONTINUED)
</b>

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         3.
</b>




<b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                            GUARDS
</b>
                      (in Turkish)
             Stop!   Stop!
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING
OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their
target. Guards check their weapons on the run.




<b>EXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road.
Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.
OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.




<b>INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
FATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13),
JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams
again.

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes!
Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her
hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails.
Drained of color. Almost black.
Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical.
On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all
crammed into the hallway outside the opened door.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)
</b>

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                     4.
</b>




<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one
that's gone bad.
The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his
heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here.
GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER --




<b>EXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING
</b>
Not in a third world country but smack center in one of
America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in
the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest
fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt
liquor.

<b>SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY
</b>




<b>EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT
</b>
A faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps
out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.




<b>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER
</b>
Doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief
of sunlight. A MAN -- whose face we don't see -- steps
inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of
a raven.
He pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a
cigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.




<b>INT. NARROW STAIRCASE HALL WALL
</b>
Lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the
unexplainable.
The Stranger pushes through. Suspicious faces step out
of his path. The ones that don't he pushes aside -- even
the gangbangers.
The man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact,
no fear of anything.
This man is JOHN CONSTANTINE.
He arrives at his destination, barges into --

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                      5.
</b>




<b>INT. APARTMENT 7B
</b>
One scan of the situation is all it takes. The bed --
the child -- the panicked priest -- who rushes to John.

<b>                        HENNESSEY
</b>
                  (whispering)
          Thank God you're here...
John shoots him a disgusted look.    Hennessey gives him a
wide berth.
John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a
glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing
tip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the
child's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor
instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of
the little girl and whispers --

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          This is Constantine. John
          Constantine, asshole.
The girl JOLTS, bandages on her arms cut into her skin.
Eyes snap open -- glare right through him.

<b>                          JOHN
</b>
          How ya doing?

<b>                        JEANIE
</b>
          Vamos juntos a matarla.
John whips out a key chain crammed with medallions.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Let's see who we got here...
He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's
face. He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS
until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look
away.
John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely
puzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          I need a mirror. Now.
Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact.   John pushes
it away, turns to the doorway crowd.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          A large mirror. At least --
                  (sizes up the child)
          -- three feet high.

<b>                                            (CONTINUED)
</b>

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                        6.
</b>




<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
The hallway crowd discusses possibilities.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>

<b>             MOVE.
</b>
Tenants run to retrieve a mirror.     Hennessey looks
worried.
John grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings
the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces
it toward the window.




<b>INTERCUT - APARTMENT 5G BELOW
</b>
Several of the MEN from the hallway crowd storm through
an OLD WOMAN'S stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron-
framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the
wall.




<b>JOHN
</b>
centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS
EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window,
looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is
parked.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Chaz?
CHAZ (20s) looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated.
You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Move the car.

<b>                             CHAZ
</b>
             Why?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>

<b>             MOVE THE DAMN CAR.
</b>
John frees the drapery rope, ducks back into the room.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             Park the car -- Move the car...
Chaz shifts into reverse, moves the car three feet.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             There, I moved the damn car.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                      7.
</b>




<b>INT. HALLWAY
</b>
Four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. The
Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They swing
the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She
freaks.




<b>INT. APARTMENT 7B
</b>
Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope
through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan.
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to
be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.
John has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.
Dark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and
English.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --
The girl chokes as if ready to spit.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          That's it -- time to go home.
Jeanie SCREAMS --

<b>                        JEANIE
</b>
          Tiempo para morir!
Her body suddenly PULSES half again larger. John recoils
for a beat. Odd. He continues in Aramaic --

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Amar natash bow basar --
Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen
expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon
inside were trying to burst right through.
John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh,
like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances
to Hennessey. What the hell?
MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.
John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
          Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.

John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over
him.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Hennessey, tie it off --
Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly
ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the
girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above
him.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Now close your eyes -- all of you
             -- and whatever happens -- do not
             look into the mirror.
The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the
weight.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind
             from the flesh I command thee!
Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young
body all out of proportion.
John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is
reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young
girl in there, but something else. The surface of the
mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to
look --

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             No!
Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises
up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep.

<b>                             HENNESSEY
</b>
             John?!

<b>                              JOHN
</b>
                        (looking into
                         mirror)
             Not yet!
John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting
off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out
first?
Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She
goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to
death.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             Look!   Look at me!
But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the
medallion that caused the earlier reaction --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Goddamit -- look!
-- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide
and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her
reflection and the image in the mirror changes
drastically.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Smile pretty you vain prick.
The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off
DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in.
MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon
reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into
three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Now, Hennessey. Now!
Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus
pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended

<b>FINGER.
</b>

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             For your boss.
Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion.
Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of
wood --

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             No you don't.
John jumps up and helps push the mirror free.




<b>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR
</b>
Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over
end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING
the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO
buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three
hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON
the taxi's hood.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>

<b>             SHIT!
</b>
Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING
into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air.
The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city
beyond.
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.




<b>INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
Jeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again.
And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note
the girl's fingernails. No longer black.
John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still
burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is
approaching the mother.

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             Now about the fee...
John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact
that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance.
He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a
child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing
of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick.
This image is repeated over and over.
John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.




<b>INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER
</b>
Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing
the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross
themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch
them, shake their hands.
A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail
at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished
veneer.
This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers.
JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing
something. No one there. Balthazar is gone.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps
where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the
tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause.

<b>                              HENNESSEY
</b>
             Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Hennessey.
Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the
exit.




<b>INT. FOYER
</b>
John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance.      John
rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck.

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             I know, I know, but I didn't think
             she was really possessed, not like
             that.

<b>                           JOHN

             I'm not back an hour and you drag
             me into --

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             -- Don't be mad, John, don't be --
John rummages through his coat pockets --

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             On the left side.
John keeps searching.

<b>                             HENNESSEY
</b>
             Vest pocket.
John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Don't do that shit on me --

<b>                             HENNESSEY
</b>
             Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have
             half.
Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the
hat.

</b>
             I should take it all, save you
             from yourself.
He gestures that bagged BOTTLE in Hennessey's jacket.

<b>                           HENNESSEY
</b>
             It keeps them out, so I can sleep.
             Please, John, I need to sleep.
John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips
a few bills from the wad and hands them over.
Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to
follow. John simply holds up a hand. Hennessey stops,
watches John walk out. Alone.




<b>EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT
</b>
John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from
the taxi's hood.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I told you to move it.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             Well maybe if you had told me you
             were dropping a three-hundred
             pound mirror with a pissed-off
             demon in it I would have moved it
             further.
Chaz slams the hood.      They slide into the car.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             Well?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Well what?
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls
out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             Shouldn't have cut your stay in
             the land of enlightenment. You
             were so close to growing a
             conscience.
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and
sits back.

He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Never ceases to entertain.
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs.




<b>EXT. THE SKY
</b>
One of those perfect days. With perfect clouds. So
clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven.
Two young girls rise INTO FRAME on side-by-side swings.
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible
sky. Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to
Earth.

<b>                           MAN (V.O.)

             You still with me?




<b>INT. SUBWAY - DAY

ANGELA'S (30) weary eyes open. She's on her belly hidden
between track ties and shadows even deeper. Grips a
police-issue revolver tight. She's pinned down, unable
to move.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Yeah...
The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES
ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere.
How either of these two got here isn't important.      Who
will get out is.

             So what's next, Detective?   We

Intermittent RADIO CHATTER buzzes from Angela's WALKIE-

left.

                     (almost pleading)

far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER.

             Get off the tracks! Blueline is

Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp.
The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through
the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova.
The SOUND is DEAFENING.

<b>                           MAN (O.S.)

             C'mon, Detective, step into the

Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT.
She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado --
rises as she AIMS.
And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun.
Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET
RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes
down right in the train's path.

Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her
breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the
train roars past in a staccato blur.




<b>EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks.




<b>TAXI TRUNK

OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John
starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells --

<b>                           CHAZ

             There are four bags. I have two

             Make two trips?
John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath.




<b>INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY
</b>
Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks
totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area,
runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally
stops at a pearl-white dazzler.
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep
area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13.
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead,
scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED."
He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished
wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity.
An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her
a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it.
John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the
pool tables.

<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT
</b>
Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as
a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end
seem like it's a mile away.
Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives.

<b>                        CHAZ
</b>
                  (yells across room)
          Simple question. How much longer
          do I have to be your slave?
John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          You're not my slave, Chaz. You're
          my very appreciated assistant.
          Like Tonto and Robin and that
          skinny fellow with the fat friend.
Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon
Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand-
marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of
place.

<b>                        CHAZ
</b>
          How much longer?
John doesn't like his tone.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Well I don't know, what's the
          going rate for saving a taxi
          driver hanging from his
          fingernails about to be swallowed
          into the jaws of Hell?

John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his
pockets.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          I need to make an appearance at

Chaz sighs, starts out --

Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him.

             A little something from Delphi.
It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow.
Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing.

<b>                             CHAZ

             Gee, thanks.
Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his
jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the
window -- stares out.

<b>                           BEEMAN (O.S.)

             'Provisions depleted?'
John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             I gave you three months worth.
             You were gone only one.
This diminutive occult version of Bond's "Q" carries a
custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What can I say, Beeman, India was
             a real drain.
They shake hands.     Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the
table, unzips it.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             So what do you need?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Maybe. Incubus in this girl I
             just exorcized seemed a bit more
             spirited than usual.
Beeman starts pulling things out.      First is a frayed RAG.
Then glass containers...

             Well, I've got your stone
             fragments from the Road to
             Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea
             Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --
Out comes a little MATCHBOX with a smiling bug graphic.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
He shakes the matchbox and the BEETLE flutters inside.
It's WINGS create an eerie HIGH-PITCHED WHIRL. John
shrugs. So?

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             Yeah, to you it's nothing but to
             the Fallen -- like fingernails on
             a chalkboard.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What is it with you and bugs?
Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured BRASS KNUCKLES.
Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings.
John takes them, tries them on. Nice fit.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             Gold was blessed by the Bishop
             Anicott during the Crusades.
John spots a foot-long COPPER TUBE in the bag, pulls it
out, grips the bicycle handle on one end.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             Watch it there.
With this puny little thing? John gives the handle a
squeeze and WHOOOOSH -- ten-foot FLAME BELCHES out.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             Dragon's breath.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I thought you couldn't get it
             anymore.
Beeman shrugs, modesty. John starts to put it down on
the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away.

                     (off John's look)
             Piece of the shroud Moses wore to
             the mountain.
John picks it up -- You're shitting me, right?    Nope.

<b>                           JOHN

Beeman just stares at him -- is this a joke?

             Wouldn't happen to have anything
             for --
Beeman sets down a bottle from the bag -- Vick's 44.

<b>INT. LOCKER ROOM
</b>
Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the
grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her
shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror.
Tired, aging eyes stare back.

<b>                        WEISS (O.S.)

Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker.

<b>                          ANGELA
</b>
          Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.
The two exchange a look.

<b>                        WEISS
</b>
          You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No

                  (shuts his locker)
          Even though it was reckless --
          irresponsible -- stupid...

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          I knew you still cared.

          I know, nobody's luck lasts

He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care.
Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her
locker door, notices her reflection does not turn.
She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it
should be. She shudders, slams the locker door.




<b>EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM

So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a
pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun.

Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A
Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front
are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which
is --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Two frogs on a bench.
Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him --
he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS.

<b>                           CHAZ
</b>
             Two frogs on a bench.
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card
shows a BEAR in a dress.

<b>                            CHAZ
</b>
             What?   But I'm with him!   Right,
             John?   John?
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz
backs away, stares after him. Someday.




<b>INT. CLUB MIDNITE
</b>
MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.
NICO, a young black man, walks past John.

<b>                           NICO
</b>
             Neighborhood's going to Hell.
John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on.
One of the men in the group turns, watches John.
Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN.




<b>INT. HALLWAY

John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of
two very large doors.

Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over
countless centuries. John places his fingers into the
gnarled folds, closes his eyes --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Numquam leadatur a morsu.
A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors
don't budge.

             Midnite! Come on, do I have to
             huff and puff here?!
The doors unlatch.




<b>INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE
</b>
SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific
sculpture that normally displays our solar system in
relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS
with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL,
ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR."
This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And
it's not moving.

PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office.
Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A

             That's not what I asked.

</b>
             Hey, can I help it if Buddhist
             monks don't take bribes?
Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from
his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops
Midnite cold.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Gotcha.
A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He
takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares
breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a
cosmic wind.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             Second century depiction of a

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Right.    So we good here?
Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic
precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the
Universal orrery.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             It should counter the iconic
             plane --

</b>
             That damn thing's never going to
             balance.
Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts
to move. To turn.

John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic
collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt.
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously.

<b>                           MIDNITE

</b>
             It's authentic, Midnite, you just
             have the wrong piece. Jesus...
The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face
is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What? -- I didn't blink -- that
             was a cough. You never cough?
Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a
thick stack of HUNDREDS.

</b>
             I don't know... Just a feeling --

to see --

him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out.

             Don't have it or don't want to use

Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him.

             Just look around. A few days.
             You spot anything unusual,
             anything -- you let me know.
             Okay?
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy,
then reaches behind his neck --

</b>
             It'll be like old times.
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That
unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's
pocket.

Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the
bottle over. John downs the rest. Nods.

Angela in the SHOWER -- trying to wash off the guilt.

Angela now in a recliner, cat in her lap.   She's tired.
Eyes are heavy.

Angela's eyes open. An Angela whose frightened features
are dripping with a fever sweat.
She's in a hospital gown, stares around a corner.
Janitor polishes the floor in the distance. A nurse
checks off charts in the f.g. And right between the two
darts Angela, unseen by anyone.

A metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out --

The sound has drawn the attention of BARRY (10) lying in
bed. He moves up and stares out the window -- sees the
broken glass in the courtyard. He scans up the building
and spots a FIGURE standing on the roof.




<b>ROOFTOP - WIDER
</b>
Chilling April air flutters Angela's gown, vaporizes her
breath. Tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates
the unthinkable.
Cityscape of lights are spread out below but Angela is
seeing something else.

</b>
is a city engulfed in RED FLAMES. Follow that tear with
the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek
and slips into her mouth.
ANGELA shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has
swelled and reddened just like the Prisoner's. And
there's that same circular symbol in the flesh.
She wipes her tears -- tries to be strong. Takes a few
breaths for courage, them simply steps off.

BARRY'S WIDE EYES follow her down.

Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down
to Angela's contorted body. But she's still alive.
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast. He reaches
out, touches her face. Eyes close. She's gone.

Angela stirs awake.   Disturbed.

John switches on the light, leans up from the sink and
wipes his mouth with a towel. It's covered with blood.
More runs down the drain. He stares at himself in the
mirror. ON John's worried eyes --

Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers

          It's Isabel.
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard.
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the
face.
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and
furious.
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela. That's
when you realize that wasn't a dream. This is her twin.
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now.
Angela's eyes well with tears. It takes everything she
has to stay in control. Helps to wrap herself in the
job. She steps back, looks up at the tall building.

<b>                        ANGELA

Angela gives him an incredulous glare.   Shakes her head.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

John marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step
behind. He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs.
Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers.
John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates.




<b>INT. RAVENSCAR - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

View of the rooftop. There's Isabel in her nightgown,
stepping up -- pausing just a second. Then one step and
she's gone. So clear. So unrefutable.

Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her
shoulder.

             Take some time...
Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the
others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was
that?




<b>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE
</b>
A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A
DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John
stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.

<b>                           JOHN

             No -- I've beaten things,

             people have never even heard of
             and after all that you think I'm
             going to be done in by THIS?
He raises a puny little cigarette. DR. LES ARCHER (50)
sighs. A delicate bedside manner is not his specialty.

             This is different. This is
             aggressive.
John tries to stay cool -- fails.     He TRASHES the X-ray
boxes. Diseased lungs disappear.      Doc shakes his head.

<b>                           DR. ARCHER

             Twenty years ago you didn't want

<b>INT. HALLWAY

John steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to
gather himself. He starts walking. Wants out of here
fast.




<b>INT. RAVENSCAR - HALLWAY

Angela is on the move. Emotions are coming in strong.
She can't get out of here fast enough.
She aims for the elevators, sees a MAN has just entered
one.

Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in. John stands
inside alone. This should be the first time we realize
they were in the same hospital.

<b>EXT. SOMEWHERE IN ISTANBUL - DAY
</b>
A PICKUP TRUCK crosses a barren landscape.
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner.
He grips the relic tight in one hand.   That anxious fever
has returned.
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising
jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're
on -- heading the opposite way.
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic
tighter.
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through
the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks
his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the
process.
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control. He
swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over
as driver.
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and
into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising
airliners in the distance.




<b>EXT. L.A. APARTMENT - DAY

Close to condemned status. SCAN UP floor after floor,
COMING TO REST ON a window covered with aluminum foil.




<b>INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT
</b>
Every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum
foil. A sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of
newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing
in check.
He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet
but it's not there. Oh yeah -- in the pocket. Decision
made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the
walls and the window.

<b>EXT. ECHO PARK (DOWNTOWN L.A.) - DAY
</b>
John sits at a park bench. Motionless. Taking in the
world. Clouds passing the sun. Shadows drifting across
the city. Leaves swirling after passing cars.
John just sits there, HEARING every breath he takes,
wondering which one will be his last.

<b>                         ELLIE (O.S.)
</b>
          Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!
John turns to see ELLIE (23) strutting up the sidewalk.
Uninhibited. Oozing sex appeal. But dangerous. In more
ways than you think.

<b>                        ELLIE
</b>
          That's funny as shit, John.

<b>                        JOHN

</b>
          Now why wouldn't you trust me?

<b>                        JOHN

          I don't know, something in the

She sits right on his lap, playfully.

<b>                        ELLIE
</b>
          Don't worry, John, you'll beat
          this. You beat everything.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Not this time, Ellie.
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside.

<b>                        ELLIE
</b>
          Oh wow, you're serious... No
          wonder the Boss is in such a good
          mood.

Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd SOUND as she
does.

</b>
             What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe
             you but to even ASK that? All
             those saints and martyrs slipping
             through his grasp -- his own foot
             soldiers sent back to him in
             chunks. He's going to take all
             that out on you, John, and he's
             going to enjoy ripping your soul
             to shreds until the end of time.

<b>                           JOHN

             So I take that as a 'no?'

<b>                           ELLIE
</b>
             You're the one soul the man
             himself would actually come up
             here to collect. And you know how
             much he despises this place.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I'm starting to see his point.
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm.

<b>                           ELLIE
</b>
             Have you gone to see the Snob?
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard.     No way.

<b>                           ELLIE
</b>
             Look, don't let your ego get in
             the way on this. I'd miss having
             someone up here I can... relate
             to.
She gives him a kiss. And for a second John's leg is
brushed by a tail. John doesn't react. Just turns and
walks away.




<b>INT./EXT. CHAZ'S TAXI - DAY

Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society
building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place
for this city. John stares out the back seat window,

A few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies
Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists.
John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the --




<b>LIBRARY
</b>
John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front
of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped
in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret.
John stands to the side and waits for their conversation
to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds.

<b>                           ATTENDANT

Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away,
her gaze fixed on the same two men.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             I'm not staying long either.
John glances over and for the second time they make
contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit
too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace.

John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start
to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men.
Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and
John goes for --
-- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one.

             Father... David -- this is Isabel.

             I'll talk to him again.
But Angela has just lost a load of faith.




<b>BY THE FIREPLACE
</b>
Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with
unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against
the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings.
The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat.

<b>                           GABRIEL

                     (without looking back)
             I know what you want, son.

             Been keeping your all-seeing eye
             on me, have you?

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             I could offer how a shepherd leads
             even the most wayward of his flock
             but it might sound disingenuous.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             So you're going to make me beg?
Angela pauses on her way out, looks over.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             It wouldn't help. You've already
             wasted your chance at redemption.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What about the minions I've sent
             back, the souls that I've saved --
             that should guarantee my passage
             across --

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
                     (keeping it private)
             -- No -- passage requires faith
             and faith by definition is belief
             without proof. You have proof.
             And that means you're not playing
             by the same rules as everyone
             else. Your work has mostly been
             for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             This is bullshit -- bullshit!
Now he's really got Angela's attention.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             It's like you've got some cosmic
             scale weighing everything we do --
             help an old lady across the
             street -- put in a nickel, kick a
             dog, take out a dime -- you're

John jumps up, leans into his face.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             And you know what, you're the ones
             with the problem, not us -- You make
             these impossible rules to decide who
             goes up, who goes down and you don't
             even understand us --
This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             Each of you is born with the
             promise of salvation preordained.
             The cost of your redemption is
             simple belief. And yet you whine
             about impossible rules. Sometimes
             I imagine you hardly deserve the
             gift you have been given.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Gift?! More like a curse the way
             you manage things.
Gabriel stands and towers over John.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             I am taking your situation into
             account, John, but don't push me.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Why me, Gabriel? It's personal,
             isn't it? I didn't go to church
             enough? I didn't pray enough? I
             was five bucks short in the
             collection plate? Why?
Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             You're going to die because you
             smoked 30 cigarettes a day since
             you were 15. And you're going to
             Hell because of the life you took.
             Or to put it in a way that your kind
             would understand. You're fucked.




<b>EXT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour.
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the
other side, looking equally frayed. They share another
glance.

John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.        Empty.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             He has a rotten sense of humor.
                     (steps past)
             And his punch lines are killers.
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the
RAIN, away from Chaz's taxi pulling up.

<b>                            CHAZ
</b>
                      (shouting out)
             John?   It's raining! Hey!
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at
the empty cigarette pack.

<b>INT. HENNESSEY'S APARTMENT - A CIGARETTE PACK
</b>
lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and
stacks of newspapers. Hennessey sits amongst the
garbage, slumped over. But he's not sleeping.
He's surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to
guide him. His hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of
information.
Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey's eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers
away and sees an OBITUARY. A name -- Isabel Dodson.




<b>EXT. L.A. STREETS - EVENING
</b>
John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.

<b>                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)
</b>
             Hey, buddy, you got a light?
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing
behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.

<b>                           OLD MAN
</b>
                     (coughs)
             We gotta stick together, right?
John gathers himself. As he walks over to this OLD MAN,
he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a
matchbox.
The box shudders as a high-pitch FLUTTERING filters from
inside. Old Man winces as his entire body VIBRATES.
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with
the screech beetle inside. And now he knows -- a beat
too late.
Old Man attacks.
John is knocked onto his haunches. As the Old Man closes
in, he's revealed in more detail. Body and face are
actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city
vermin. Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held
together in the shape of a man.
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's
outstretched grasp. He shakes the matchbox and the
screech beetle inside flutters again.
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart
for a second, then snaps back together. He GRABS onto
John with fingers of squirming vermin. Snake wraps
around his wrist. Crab snaps at his skin.
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to
vibrate even further. Old Man grabs John's head and
vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face.
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then
smashes it against the sidewalk.
BEETLE lets out a death SHRIEK and the Old Man
stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can
actually see the b.g. through the seams.
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it
with all his might. Old Man form shatters on impact.

</b>
The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of
scattering critters. John starts stomping on them as
they scatter into the city.
John stands there, shocked and concerned.      What the hell
is going on?




<b>INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
That surveillance VIDEO FOOTAGE from Ravenscar plays
again. There's Isabel in her nightgown walking across
the roof.
Spread out on a cluttered coffee table is Isabel's case
file. CORONER'S REPORT is opened. Let's see "NO DRUGS
IN SYSTEM" and the biggie -- "Cause of Death -- SUICIDE."
Angela sits on the couch in her robe.      Disheveled and
distraught. She's taking this hard.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>

She lowers her head.     And in that brief moment of
silence --

</b>
                     (on TV)
             Constantine.
Angela snaps back to the TV, freezes in shock.
There's Isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking
right back AT us -- at Angela. Then she's gone.
Angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence
again. This time Isabel doesn't look back. This time
there is no name. But Angela did see it. Did hear it.
She sits for a second.     Stunned.

A police guard scans passengers and a printout of the

This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and
glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the

Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the
iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He
has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt.

<b>                           JOHN

             Always a catch...
Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             My sister was murdered last week.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Sorry to hear...

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Her name was Isabel.   Isabel
             Dodson?
She looks for a reaction.     None.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             You don't remember her?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Never met her.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             You sure?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             She look anything like you?
                     (as Angela nods)
             I would've remembered.
Another beat as their eyes meet.       John looks away.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             She was a patient at Ravenscar.
             Then last Tuesday she just decided
             to step off the roof.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I thought you said she was murdered?

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Isabel would never take her own life.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You'd be surprised at what people
             will do.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Look, I know I'm not making much
             sense -- hell I'm not really sure
             what I'm doing here... I just
             feel -- the circles you travel
             in -- the occult, demonology,
             exorcisms...
John just stares at that spider in the glass.       Trapped.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             I believe someone got to her, Mr.
             Constantine, brainwashed her into
             stepping off that roof. Some kind
             of legion or cult.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Well I thought with your
             background and experience, you
             could at least point me in the
             right direction.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             Yeah, okay.   Sure.
John points -- toward the exit.      Angela is not amused.
But she's not giving up.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             My sister always talked about a
             world better than this. Heaven as
             some call it. She wasn't afraid
             of dying because she knew it was
             waiting for her. What everyone
             fails to grasp is that if she had
             really taken her own life --

</b>

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             -- she would have committed a
             mortal sin and her soul would have
             gone straight to Hell where it
             would never feel love or
             compassion or anything but pain
             again as the master himself rips
             her apart over and over for the
             rest of eternity.
                     (beat)
             That about right?
The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless.
John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it
back -- but it's too late.
She turns and starts out, slows --

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             You're not the only one afraid of
             Hell.
John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He
glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long.
Good riddance.
But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the
buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused,
realizes they're heading in Angela's direction.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Oh shit...
He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks
the glass over. Spider runs free.




<b>EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks
along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her.
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in
with each step.

<b>                           JOHN (O.S.)
</b>
             Detective!
Angela looks back, sees John in the street.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             How open is your mind?

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't
see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But
John does. He starts walking toward her.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?
                     (off no answer)
             How about what comes out of each?
Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Hey!

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             You mean like angels?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             And demons.
Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             See, you don't have the mindset
             for this kind of work.
They walk together down the lonely street.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Look, I see terrible things every
             day. A mother drowns her baby. A
             ten-year-old shoots his father.
             But it's not demons, it's the evil
             that men do.
Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another.
They're not looking back so they don't see it.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You're right, we're capable of
             terrible things but we usually
             justify it with motives like money
             and power and jealousy.
Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Then sometimes, something comes
             along and gives us just the right
             nudge and we do truly evil things
             just for the kick of it.

</b>

<b>                           ANGELA

             I don't believe in demons.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             You should.   They believe in us.
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then
blacks out. Both look up.
The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT.
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind
them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight
ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING

<b>BRIGHT.
</b>

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             We should go...
Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand --

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Fast.
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural
WIND races toward them.
John jerks her into action. They run towards the next
light. It blinks out right when they reach it.
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety
of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.




<b>EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY
</b>
They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of
overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the
branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats
at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek.
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER,
fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths.
John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum.
A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination.
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of
blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like
LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them.

<b>                             ANGELA
</b>
             What is that?

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
John is just as surprised he's saying this --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Wings.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Wings?
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that
cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around
Moses.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             And maybe talons.
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Are you kidding? Of what?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Something that's not supposed to
             be here.
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand.
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get
CLOSER -- ghastly sound of MOVEMENT in the fringes of
light.
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with
every second the circle of light gets smaller and those
SOUNDS GET CLOSER. John takes out his special lighter.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Close your eyes.
They are now standing in pitch darkness.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Why?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Suit yourself.
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion --
sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand.
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then IGNITES with a
brilliant retina-searing FLASH -- blinding Angela and
illuminating a --
-- CIRCLE OF WINGED DEMONS -- a roiling broth of
reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
RED FLAME radiates from the cloth and DEMONS SHRIEK as
they are instantly vaporized.
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket,
extinguishes the flame. He leans down to a rubbery stain
left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. Shakes his
head in disbelief.

<b>                           JOHN

                     (to himself)
             'I accidentally crossed over?'    I
             don't think so.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
                     (coming up behind)
             What was that? I saw wings -- and
             teeth -- they were flying. What
             the hell were those things?!

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             They weren't angels.
John scans the area, trying to think this through.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Seplavites, actually. Scavengers
             for the damned.
                     (off her lost look)
             Demons?

<b>                           ANGELA

             What? You can't be serious...
             this is impossible...

             Yeah...
                     (to himself)
             And I don't think they were after
             me...
John looks at her with renewed interest.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You really believe she wouldn't
             commit suicide?

<b>                           ANGELA

             My sister?

             Never in a million years.
John makes the decision.

He starts walking.     Angela is now compelled to follow.

<b>                             ANGELA

             How?

<b>                            JOHN

             Simple.   See if she's in Hell.




<b>EXT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
Not exactly an inviting place.
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his
destination.




<b>INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
John stares at a photo of Angela and her father in police
uniform. Obviously happier times.
Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box.
That gray cat follows close to her heels.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             These are all Isabel's things.

<b>                             JOHN

             The cat too?

<b>                             ANGELA
</b>
             Yeah, why...?
John ignores the box of items, picks up the cat. He
studies it a bit, then sits back in a chair with it.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Don't you need candles and a
             pentagram for this to work?

                     (deadpan)
             Why, do you have any?
John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I need you to step outside now.

</b>
Angela wants to stay.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             Angela?   Please.
Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the
cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a
moment where animal and man seem to connect.
The water around John's feet begins to BOIL.
ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on
its way to latch.
Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers,
is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John
has now crossed over into --




<b>APARTMENT IN HELL
</b>
Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep,
raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind
him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed
structure in Beirut.
Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a
nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not
quite night.
John steps over the crumbling wall into --




<b>EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES
</b>
John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze
of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long-
forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE
penetrates the silence.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Is she here?
On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut
through the putrid brown haze.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Is she here?!
His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down
to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're
crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking
down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief.

<b>                              JOHN
</b>

<b>             IS SHE HERE?!
</b>
That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge
blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape,
rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this
isn't a safe place for the living.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             It's a simple question!    Is she
             here or not?!!
John suddenly locks on something far off.
On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a
sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows
she's looking right at him.

<b>                              JOHN
</b>
             Isabel?
She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a
small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing
darkness.




<b>INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY
</b>
In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes
pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES --

<b>                           JOHN (O.S.)
</b>
                     (weakly)
             Angela... come back in...
Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS
out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside.




<b>INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off
his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost
all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him.

<b>                              ANGELA
</b>
             John?     What happened?

Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm --
reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name
"ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it.
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors
Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight --
tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain
overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor.
John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches
out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this
close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes
herself.

<b>                            ANGELA
</b>
             How?   How did you do this...?
John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails.




<b>INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a
cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type.
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he's still alone.
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead.
Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last.
Hennessey shudders. This is it.
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void --

<b>                           JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
             When I was a kid, I saw things...




<b>FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk
in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox.

<b>                           JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
             Things I wasn't supposed to.
The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face
is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are
dug into the ground.

John looks up at the Waitress.

She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the
table by the window.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             My parents sent me to a doctor, a
             shrink, a priest. I was in four
             different institutions by the time
             I was eighteen.
Angela notes him rubbing his wrist.

             The last place they put me was run
             by a church...
A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO...

The Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING.

<b>                           JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
             The revered Father made the
             brilliant deduction that I was
             possessed, said I needed to be
             exorcised...




<b>INT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE
</b>
The Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below,
leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down
by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams
at them all.

             It was like someone trying to pull

Young John clamps his eyes shut tight.

</b>
Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          So I took things into my own hands
          and I found a way out.

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          You attempted suicide.
John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a
jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          I never attempt anything.
John's reflection in the window becomes --

kneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a...




<b>INT. CLASSROOM
</b>
Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from
all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage
men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in
school chairs and wait for John to do the deed.
He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world
around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR --

Paramedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a

The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming.
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version.

</b>
          Officially I was dead for seven

Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN.




<b>INT. AMBULANCE
</b>
FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse --




<b>INT. MORGUE (PRESENT)
</b>
Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes
fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back.
Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed.
He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming
in.

<b>                        SECURITY GUARD
</b>
          Hey, what're you doing in here?
Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer
partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further --
sees the plastic cut away. Jesus.
The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist.

<b>                        JOHN (V.O.)

          When I returned I didn't just see

Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body.
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.

             Heaven and Hell are right here,
             behind every wall, every face --
             the world behind the world. It's
             crossing over that's the real
             trick. That's why most demons can
             only whisper in our ears. But
             even a whisper can turn your
             favorite pleasure into your worst
             nightmare.




<b>INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT

HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'.

<b>                           MAITRE D'
</b>
             Sir, you need a reservation!
But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's
everywhere.
He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish,
pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are
yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life
depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything
in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes.
In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly
eating his meal. Balthazar.
Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on
it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside
gets thinner.
He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it
back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her
husband pulls her away.
Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he
grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand.
A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto
Hennessey.

<b>                           JOHN (V.O.)

             But the worst demons are the ones
             that are allowed to be here -- the
             ones that are half-human so they
             blend in...
Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and
starts toward the back EXIT.

That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment
we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that
instant we get a brief glimpse of --




<b>ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES
</b>
An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light.




<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies.
Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He
leaves out the back exit.

<b>                           JOHN (V.O.)

             They call it 'the Balance.' I

Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him.

John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at
him -- finally --

             Isabel saw things too.

The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that
chased Hennessey is just outside.

<b>                           WEISS (O.S.)
</b>
             Security Guard spotted him near
             the body, chased him out.
We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is
a complete shambles of fine dining --

             He comes over here, makes a run at
             the entire menu and pow --
             deflates like a fricken Macy's day
             balloon.
-- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down
at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an
assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore
is familiar now.
John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop
starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be.
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into
Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he
himself removed from his friend. That's even more
crushing.

John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.

With a loud crowd and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY
the noise back here is DEAFENING. But this is Beeman's

Beeman is on the phone. There's a conversation but it's
way too noisy to hear. All we see are the emotions on
Beeman's face. No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one
of the biggies.
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and
starts drawing -- listening and drawing --
He's finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That
cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention.

             Revelations and the end of the
             world. Then one day she just

John and Angela head toward Isabel's room. A NURSE

Barry, the boy in the courtyard.
He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he
breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms
outstretched.

             I'm sorry. They were friends. He

Neither does John.

             Maybe she left something else.
             Something more personal. Just for
             you.
Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You were her twin, Angela.    Twins
             tend to think alike.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             I'm not like my sister.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             But you were at once time. When
             you were kids. When you'd spend
             every waking hour with each other.
             You'd start a sentence, she'd
             finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd
             cry.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             That was a long time ago...

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             That kind of bond doesn't just
             disappear.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             There's nothing here.
Angela seems unbalanced.     John gets more aggressive.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             She planned her death in this
             room, she thought it up right
             where you're standing --
Angela backs away.     John advances.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             She knew you'd come -- She counted
             on you to see what she saw, to
             feel what she felt -- to do what
             she did. What did she do, Angela?

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             How should I know?

<b>                           JOHN

             What did she do, Angela?

<b>                             ANGELA
</b>
             I don't know!

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What would you do?
Angela backs into a wall.       Nowhere else to go now.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             What would you leave her? What
             would it be? Where would it be?!
             Where would it be?
Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of
her way. She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating.
John stays back, watches. Angela opens her eyes. The
tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees --

<b>                             ANGELA
</b>
             The tree.




<b>EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
</b>
A lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard.
John and Angela approach it. Examine it. Nothing. John
drops lower on the tree, to a child's height.   Finally
sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela.
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees.
That same SYMBOL. The one Hennessey carved into his
hand. But this time there's more.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
                     (trying to
                      rationalize)
             There must have been a tree in our
             backyard... when we were kids...
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything.
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol --

<b>                             JOHN
</b>

<b>             'COR 14:01.'
</b>

<b>                             ANGELA
</b>
             Cor?

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Corinthians.

</b>

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
                     (shaking her head)
             There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
John's face goes pale --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I need a church.




<b>INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER
</b>
Several families sit in solemn prayer. The pastor
comforts a man and wife. John and Angela slip through,
head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall.
They whisper.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the
             book of Ethenius. It's like a
             dark mirror of the Bible. It
             paints a different view of
             Revelations, says that the world
             will not come to an end at the
             hand of God but be reborn in the
             embrace of the damned.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             There's a difference?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Depends on which side of the fence
             you're standing.
John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl
of holy water near the altar.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             So why haven't I seen this book
             before?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Because it doesn't exist here on
             this side.
John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to

<b>BOIL --
</b>

<b>                           ANGELA (O.S.)
</b>
             What do you mean --
Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela
mid-question and the room in that dim half-light.
John turns and is inside --

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                     70.
</b>




<b>SAME CHAPEL - HELL
</b>
The epitome of blasphemy -- A church in Hell. Only they
don't worship God in here. And that's not Christ on the
cross. And those stained glass windows are now slate
black.
John is now facing books with completely different
markings. He searches as a DRONE rises in pitch and an
INKY BLACKNESS begins to flow down the walls, getting
closer to John with each heartbeat.
He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes --




<b>REGULAR CHAPEL
</b>

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          -- not here on this side?
John turns, covered in sweat. He's holding a book she's
never seen, is already flipping through it.

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          Where did that come from?

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
                  (stopping to read)
          13:29. 13:30 -- Here...
          Corinthians 14:01...
                  (skimming to this)
          'The sins of the father would only
          be exceeded by the ego of the
          son.'

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          Whose son?
John stands, his brain going into overdrive.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Symbol isn't a demon's... that's
          why I couldn't place it... not a
          normal possession...

<b>                        ANGELA
</b>
          John, what are you talking about?

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          But he can't cross over --
          impossible for the son to cross
          over...

<b>                         ANGELA
</b>
          Whose son?   God's?

<b>                           JOHN

             No.  The other one.
                     (off her look)
             Lucifer had a son too.




<b>INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES
</b>
Beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp. The narrow
alley of machines stretches out behind him. He stares
into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page
folded a thousand times. Turns another page.




<b>BOWLING AREA
</b>
Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's
closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness,
the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
beasts.

<b>                           BEEMAN (O.S.)
</b>
             Oh my...




<b>BEHIND THE LANES
</b>
Beeman has stopped turning pages. That's because he's
now staring at an etching of the same symbol. Below are
ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body.
But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling.
A figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly
welcoming the beast into this world.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             This is not good...
BOWLING BALL hits a lane.     Beeman spins to the sound.
BALL ROLLS round and round, closer and closer until it
CLANGS dead against the back wall of one of the lanes.
Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin
machines.
He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the
machinery and peeks out the pin hole.

<b>                           BEEMAN
</b>
             John?

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                     72.
</b>




<b>EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John
gets her up to speed.

<b>                         JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
           The myth says Mammon was conceived
           before his father's fall from
           grace but was born after.




<b>INT. SUV
</b>

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
           But unlike his old man, he's never
           been in the presence of the Creator
           so he has no fear of him, no respect
           either. That goes double for us --
           God's most prized creations. Mammon
           would be the last demon we'd ever
           want crossing over.

<b>                         ANGELA
</b>
           But demons can't come and go,
           that's what you said.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
           Unless they found a bridge.
                   (off her look)
           Some psychic with the chops to
           reach all the way to Hell and the
           grit to withstand whatever shit
           she'd pull out.

<b>                          ANGELA
</b>
           Isabel...

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
           But even a bridge wouldn't help
           Mammon. Because to cross over, the
           myth says he'd still need the one
           thing he could never get. Divine
           assistance. The help of God.
Angela sits back, letting that sink in.

<b>                         ANGELA
</b>
           So it's impossible.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
           Impossible? Sure it's impossible.
           That's what makes it so dangerous.
           These things exist to break the
           rules, to find the loopholes. If
           the past is any indication, then
           the future isn't on our side.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
John sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode.

<b>                          ANGELA
</b>
             She knew. That's why she killed
             herself. But it doesn't make
             sense...

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Makes sense to me.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             John, she sacrificed herself to
             beat him.
John nods.     Your point?

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Why is she in Hell?
One of those rare moments where John has no answer.




<b>INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY
</b>
Something small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It
lands in the trough, spins round and round --
Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver
object keeps spinning.
He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then
another.
Book on his desk ignites in flame.




<b>EXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT
</b>
SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before
Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few
flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John
rushes in.




<b>INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY
</b>
Only a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley.

<b>                             JOHN
</b>
             Beeman?
John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's
locked from the other side.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
                     (pounds on door)
             Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Maybe he's not here.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             He's always here.
Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices,
turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES
near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots
them as well.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             What?
John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and
thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth.
They approach the pin area of the center lane. The
source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch
trough is a solid mound of flies.
John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the
mound.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Oh Jesus, no --
He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million
flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged.
Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears --

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
                     (stepping back)
             Oh God --
John goes ballistic, screams to the walls --

</b>
             Who are you?! Answer me!!
             Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I
             summon you!
He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct
TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all
his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating --
Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode --

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Angela steps back in awe as the air around his
outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole
from the bowling alley right into another world right
here -- darker -- Hellish --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Into the light I command thee!!
             Into the light I --
John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms
separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela
just how ill he really is.
She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             ... this is my fault... I sent
             them in... I sent them right to
             their deaths... a damn one-man
             plague.

             John, you need a doctor.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying.
John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help.

<b>                           JOHN

             Please --
He uses the handrail to walk away. Angela stands there,
confused by her own emotions. She turns back to the
carnage, hears the distant SIRENS.




<b>INT./EXT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John sits in his opened window, simmering. He holds a
lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips.
Outside the city goes about its unending churn.

Down on the street are several police vehicles. ENGINES

John meets her eyes.     Sees the questions piling up.

<b>                           ANGELA

                     (walking towards him)
             You see something in me...
             Something Isabel had.

<b>                           JOHN

             Go home, Angela.

<b>                           ANGELA

             I need to understand --
John just shakes his head.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Why not?

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Because you open up to that world,
             you're inviting whatever's out
             there back in. That's what
             happened to Isabel.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             I'm not Isabel.

<b>                           JOHN

             No, she embraced her gift while
             you denied yours and that denial
             is exactly why you're still alive.
             Stick with me, that'll change.
John gets off the window, starts walking away.

<b>                           JOHN

             And I don't need another ghost

That stops him cold.

</b>
             I can't let them get away with
             that. Even if it means going down
             the same path she did. Now if you

             You do this, there's no turning

Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement.

Pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment -- drawing
closer to the opened bathroom door. WATER is pouring.

             It's the universal conduit.
             Lubricates the transition from one

John turns off the faucet.

Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself.
When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.

John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above
the water as she lowers down. Her breathing is picking
up. John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Angela takes a deep breath, holds it. John pulls his
hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted
on his the entire time.




<b>ANGELA'S POV
</b>
A silent John ripples above.     His hand grips her arm,
skin to skin.




<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Angela lies there and panic sets in. She starts to
surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom,
holds it firm. Her eyes dart about. Air is running out.
She can't hold her breath much longer. It's not
working --
But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the
current were ramping down. It slows to that dim half-
light as --
JOHN'S EYES -- CLOSE.     A single blink.
ANGELA is lying in now BOILING WATER, screaming for all
of her life. Water muffles the sound but not the fury.
Huge TUB SHUDDERS hard -- snapping out of the hold down
bolts. John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman?
Another SCREAM and the inch-thick TUB CRACKS.     Water
starts streaming onto the tile.
John lunges, grabs Angela and PULLS her up from the
water -- her muffled SCREAMS SHATTERING the air as her
mouth breaks the surface. She SLAMS hard against his
chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his
back -- leaving marks that might just scar.
TUB GIVES WAY and the damn breaks. John and Angela go
down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them
both.
ANGELA lies there on top of John. Trembling.      She looks
up him, eyes filled with revelation.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             All those people... so sad...
John nods, helping her understand.

             to duck... it's not luck... I've
             always known...
Tears stream down her cheeks. John reaches out to touch
her when her eyes CLAMP TIGHT in pain --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Angela?
Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out.
John pries himself from the tile, goes after her.




<b>INT. BEHIND THE ALLEY
</b>
Angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping
water the entire way. John tries to keep up.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             It was rolling toward him -- not a
             ball -- something smaller. Shiny.
She stops, kneels to the floor.     John walks up to join her.
Something glints in the catch trough. She reaches down,
plucks it up and brings an odd COIN INTO VIEW --
John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar
coin.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Balthazar.




<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are
dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go
everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets.
Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.




<b>CHRISTIAN RELICS

There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the
petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft

<b>-- HOLY SHOTGUN.

He swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting
powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into
one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and FIRES.
BULLET leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his
endless apartment, blasts the center out of --
A carton of Lucky Strikes.
SETTLE ON the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away.

<b>                           ANGELA (V.O.)

<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER

John is stuffing the bowling bag while Angela watches,
now dressed in dry clothes. That shirt is John's.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             That half-breed tipped my scales
             when he started killing my
             friends. I'm just adding a little
             counterweight.
John lifts that holy shotgun -- KA CHICK --

             What about me?    I can't stay here
             forever.
John turns to her -- locks on those eyes. He reaches
into his coat pocket as he walks up to her. She shudders
as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're
cheek to cheek. When he pulls back she sees he has
clipped Hennessey's AMULET around her neck.

<b>                           JOHN

             Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

A jet-black '70s BARRACUDA BLASTS from the basement

Angela hangs on as John grabs the SKULL shifter knob --

'57 Chevy sign, that Mission in the park.
This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.

Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of
concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money.
Lots of it.
Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty.
Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John
looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick
DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in.
John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico
from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a
"Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door
open.

             Hey, early bird is a fat bird,
             know what I'm sayin'?
Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug
and successful businessman he is. He stops at a LONG
MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His
"look."

<b>                           PRETTY BOY

             Phillip Morris.
As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts
slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a
vowel stretch. His face distorts even further.
That's got him moving closer to the mirror.
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears
in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he
sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to
move --

<b>BOOOM --
</b>
One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a
FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and
flame.
John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --
that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his
holy shotgun.

<b>                           JOHN

John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising
from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is
burned off, but now he's pissed.

<b>                           BALTHAZAR

Balthazar's young turks attack. One leaps over the
trading station. John swings around -- aims the SHOTGUN
-- BOOM -- half-breed is blasted midair.
The other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers
across the ceiling. John aims up -- PUMPS SEVERAL ROUNDS
-- steps out of the way as a body falls, smashes into a
desk. BOOM -- BOOM -- that'll keep it down.




<b>INT. BARRACUDA
</b>
Angela hears the GUNSHOTS. Cop instinct takes over and
she gets out of the car. Checks the amulet. Intact.




<b>INT. BZR TRADING ROOM
</b>
John turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't
hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame.
Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else
underneath. The true form.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             How's he doing it, you half-breed
             shit?!
John swings the flame aside so he can KICK Balthazar
against the wall. But now his WEAPON SPUTTERS. Shit.
Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and
grabs John by the throat.
Balthazar rises from the ashes.     He may be burned, but
he's one tough son of a bitch.
Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't
break his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages
through his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred
GOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand.
Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him
across the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying
ripple throughout Balthazar's body.
But he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling
on him. Again and again -- each punch weakening this
demon more.
John finally gets him against the wall. Right arm's
tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand,
and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away.
Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of
death.

John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat.
Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches
it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses --
A Bible.

             You see, that makes you eligible

             Just tell me how Mammon is
             crossing over and you can go back
             to your shithole.
Balthazar isn't convinced.
John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read --

             'May the merciful God have mercy
             on you and grant you the pardon of
             all your sins...'
He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar
glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding
authority.

<b>                           JOHN

             He was finished off by a soldier's
             spear.
He points in the Bible at a detailed painting of the
event -- Jesus hanging on the cross -- being pierced by a
soldier's spear. It matches that child's drawing John
removed from the fridge -- now lying on his seat.

             A hound on the hunt.
A blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible
speed -- denting in roofs, CRACKING a WINDSHIELD --
causing general chaos. Cars brake -- SLIDE into each
other. And still this thing keeps coming.

The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the

<b>                            ANGELA
</b>
             I lost it.
BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good
foot.
A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts
shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in.
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly.
John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and
onto the hood -- right INTO VIEW.
A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably
Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an
extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass.
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire
windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS
PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car.
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda
into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is
thrown from the car.
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             It's a fine line that separates a
             hero from a fool.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             I'll take my chances.

<b>                           MIDNITE

             And taint my establishment with
             your blood? I don't think so.

<b>                           JOHN

             Midnite --

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             You know what that device can do
             to the ill-equipped --

             Where the hell is the chair, you
             dumb shit?!
Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's
seven feet. John knows he went too far.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             That was the cancer talking, you

<b>                           MIDNITE

             Once.
John nods.

-- the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and
cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last

Sing.

<b>                           MIDNITE

             I have insurance issues.
John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks
him.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             You haven't surfed in decades.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Like riding a bike...
He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             You'll be lucky to reach an

John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him.

</b>
             In your condition your body won't

<b>                           JOHN

             I just need enough rope to find

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             One goddamn problem at a time --
John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair.
His feet dangle off the ground. Midnite stands by, won't
help. So John starts strapping himself in the chair.
His chest, his ankles. One wrist. He obviously can't
strap the other. He looks to the big man.

<b>                           JOHN

her the City of Angels sweep past. Her eyes drift open

The city is ON FIRE. It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic
vision before she jumped.

Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to

</b>
             I'll try and guide you out.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             Mammon was forced out of that girl
             when she jumped so unless he found
             a holding vessel to wait in, he
             would have fallen back to Hell.

<b>                           JOHN

             No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.

</b>
             Then watch yourself. He could be
             in anyone out there.
John nods. Midnite lifts a palm of INSECT WINGS in front
of his face.

<b>                           JOHN

Midnite cranks the JUICE on the panel as he BLOWS and John
reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. His head slams
back against the slats. His skin ripples from the force.
STAY ON his face as the sound of POWER courses through John.

stretching to infinity.

             Find the possessor and the Spear

The flash whips back TOWARD us and John is suddenly
somewhere else. He looks O.S.




<b>INT. PRISON CHAMBER FROM THE OPEN
</b>
FROM that MYSTERIOUS POV, we watch the Prisoner hold the
Spear for the first time. Like before, he turns and
looks behind him where --
John now stands. Watching.      John centers on the Spear in
the Prisoner's hand.




<b>FLASH AHEAD - INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT

That same MYSTERIOUS POV of the Prisoner in line.      He
turns as he did before and it's --

John is there. Watches as the Prisoner enters the
abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar. John reacts. How did he
miss this?




<b>FLASH AHEAD - INT. SLEEP ROOM
</b>
Fifty beds with fifty patients. Asleep. The Prisoner
kneels next to one of the beds. John walks over, touches
him and he rocks to the floor. Dead. Body reveals the
Spear on the blanket of the bed.
John reaches out to touch it when the boy BARRY suddenly
SITS UP from under the blanket and grabs him by the
throat. NOTE the boy's BLACKENED FINGERNAILS.
John struggles to pull him off but the boy's grip is
locked tight. John grabs at his hands -- chokes out the
name --

John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls

John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of

Midnite and finally --

WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across

Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a
table.

             You know these won't kill them.
John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan.

             You probably won't even get close
             enough to use them.
In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India.
It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it
dissolve.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             And it's not just the boy.
John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small
casting blocks.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             You better worry about whoever's
             helping him.
John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings
into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS.

<b>                           MIDNITE

             As much as I admire your blind

             about to become the floodgate of
             Hell is reaching a bit, even for
             you.
John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just
knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             Well I suppose two fools can die
             just as easily as one.
John almost smiles.

</b>
             Hey, you think I'm trusting you to
             save the world?
John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
             But we're going to need more than
             a few magic bullets to get inside.
John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around
the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm...

Midnite raises an eyebrow.




<b>EXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT
</b>
The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing
on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The
abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit
night. Vague figures move about near the emergency
entrance.
John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John
stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof.

             Figures.




<b>INT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM
</b>
Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in
the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large
hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is
pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes
its toll. Especially on a child.
His hands are below his waist and now we see they're
lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her
face floats just above the surface as he buckles
restraining straps around her wrists.




<b>INT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING
</b>
Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly
strut inside. Stop.
HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd.
This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers.
Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are
crowded in front of a set of double doors.
Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys.
John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot
cop.

             Okay -- let's cut the scratch and
             call it a night. Meeting's over.
That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few
chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from
the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy.

<b>                           JOHN

her.

             I'm sure you will.

             Go to Hell.
Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger.




<b>SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
Ellie and a room of half-humans -- all looking up as
water sprays from every nozzle. John and Midnite tense
because the first drops have no effect. A beat -- a
SPURT in the waterlines and suddenly -- SHRIEKS fill the
room as half human skin begins to FRY.

<b>                           ELLIE
</b>
             Holy water!
Emergency lighting has snapped on -- throwing the room
into a strobing nightmare of action. Flashes of human
skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons
underneath. It's total pandemonium as their rage is
directed toward the only real humans in the room.
John and Midnite fling their coats open -- draw their
WEAPONS and starts FIRING away at the attacking horde.
Sacred bullets cause major damage -- wounds that ripple
out through demon bodies.
John and Midnite slam back to back -- spinning under the
protective shield of a showering sprinkler head --
shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture
into the COLUMN OF SPRAY.
One reloads while the other FIRES. It's a hellish form
of a turkey shoot. Nothing sacred, nothing spared.
John goes for the double doors. Midnite covers him --
blows away another two disintegrating demons. Two come
up behind and he spins, takes them down.
JOHN gets to the doors, starts to open them when Ellie
jumps onto his back -- nails digging in.

John FIRES over his back, loosens her grip. He grabs
hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead
sprinkler head. Legs flail about.
Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John.

John drops Ellie to the floor. No more pretty face -- no
face at all -- yet the screams still come.
John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through.




<b>INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM
</b>
Angela's body and face are completely submerged now. She
comes to, sees Barry above her -- tries to rise but the
boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there. Last
bubbles are floating up from her mouth. Barry places his
other hand on her arm, closes his eyes.




<b>INT. CORRIDOR
</b>
Holy rain has stopped in here. A fine mist floats in the
air. John and Midnite make their way through. Only
their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence.
Another set of doors is ahead. Before they reach it a
faint shadow crosses in the mist. Both pause, expecting
something to reveal itself. But it doesn't.




<b>INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM
</b>
Faint waves undulate Barry's skin -- ripple from his
chest, down his arms and into a submerged Angela. Every
muscle in her body tenses in stark relief.

Barry's image ripples above her in silence. Room
lighting starts to pulse -- slower and slower and when
it's caught in that dim half-light -- Angela JOLTS and

<b>PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM HELL

Angela is lying in a bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to
see a room not much different than the one she just left.
Except for the SOUND. That low DRONE RISING IN PITCH --
those DEMONIC SCREECHES scratching at the walls.
And now those INKY splotches begin consuming the color
and light from the walls. Moving in on Angela. Closer
and closer -- whatever's coming is just about on her.

<b>                         MAMMON (O.S.)

Angela SPINS and for a split second comes face to face

John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing
in the tank. His hands in the water. On Angela.

<b>                          JOHN
</b>
                    (rushing toward him)
          Barry!
Barry looks up, sees the two men rushing toward him.
Guns aimed.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
          Let her up!!   Let her up!!
A beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's
staring at a frightened child. Barry backs away as --
-- Angela sits up behind John.    Water rippling off,
straps dangling free.
John turns -- locks on her BLACK EYES.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>
          Shit --
John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror
in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick
fix.
He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and
pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism
on the fly.

<b>                        JOHN
</b>
          Amar natash bow basar! Rescind
          from the flesh I command thee --

Angela's eyes snap open -- dark and dilated. John sees
it -- clasps a hand over her mouth -- cutting off her air
supply.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Back to Hell, asshole --
Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through.
Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face.
Angela BITES into his palm. John recoils. She shoves
him off and John hits the tile hard. Angela jumps from
the tank, pushes past in a blur. John spins to see
Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his
size-twelve grasp.

<b>                           MIDNITE
</b>
                     (to John)
             Finish it.

<b>INTERCUT WITH:
</b>




<b>MYSTERIOUS HIGH POV
</b>
John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but
it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions
Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides --
crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John
puts a hand to her forehead --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut
             num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui
             serpentes.

<b>                           JOHN/MIDNITE
</b>
             Rescind from the flesh I command
             thee -- Amar natash bow basar!
Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes
and fingernails begins to fade. It's working...
Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing
YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness.
John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is
lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed
into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible
force against the floor.
Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words
die on his lips.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW
on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object.
He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves
and slams those tattoos together --

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Into the light I command thee!
             Into the light I command thee!
It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this
spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion
the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes
that familiar shape of WINGS.

<b>                           VOICE OF MAN (O.S.)
</b>
             Your ego is astounding.
John strains to see the shadow become the real thing --
the majestic wings of an angel.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Gabriel?
John is too weak to even be surprised anymore.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             Figures...
Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             And the wicked shall inherit the
             Earth.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             You presume to judge me, John.

<b>                            JOHN
</b>
             Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call
             me provincial.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             I am seeking to inspire humankind
             to be all that was intended.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good
             thinking...
Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John.

             You've had it too easy for too
             long.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             So what's a few thousand years of
             pain, right?

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             You never deserved to be blessed.
             You've all been born with a silver
             spoon in your mouth, never really
             appreciating the gift you were
             given so freely -- unconditional
             love from your creator.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             And that just bugs the shit out of
             you.

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             It's not your fault. Like the
             animals you are, you never learn
             unless sufficiently prodded.
             Pleasure has no lasting effect.
             But subject you to pain,
             unpleasantness -- suffering -- and
             you will take notice, you will
             fight to overcome, to earn your
             redemption. That is when you're
             at your best.
Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You're trying to teach us a
             lesson?

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             No, I'm giving you the chance to
             rise above the suffering and truly
             earn the love of God.
                     (a beat)
             The road to salvation begins
             tonight. Right now.
John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the
Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's
wings beat once.
The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into

</b>
-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops
to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses.

</b>
Gabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his
rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her --
pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula.




<b>CORRIDOR - JOHN
</b>
can't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity.
It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die.
But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long
time.

<b>                         JOHN

                   (whispering)

           favorites... I'm not even allowed
           in your house these days... but I
           could use a little attention...
John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek
landing flat against the tile.
Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he
stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea.




<b>PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES
</b>
begin to quiver.   The color drains.    Blackness is waiting.




<b>CORRIDOR - JOHN
</b>
slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of
mirror.

posture begins to change. Mammon's form ripples through
her -- starts to push out through her skin. Gabriel
stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist.

<b>                         GABRIEL

</b>
pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar. He pauses a
beat, closes his eyes. STAY ON his face as he makes one
swift SLICE movement.
But he's in a rush here -- makes that same motion across
his other wrist as well.
With both wrists purging his life away, John settles back
into the corner and waits for the inevitable.

<b>                          JOHN

            Hurry...

Raises the Spear over Angela's chest.
HEAR the SOUNDS of a million DEMONS inside of her ready
to break free --
He holds the Spear high above her chest -- readies for
the final thrust as --




<b>CORRIDOR
</b>
Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and TIME COMES TO A

<b>COMPLETE STOP.
</b>
All we're left with is a distant METALLIC DRONE, like the
reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago.
John lies in that dim half-light.    Motionless.
Something starts to swirl near him and just like that,
John is no longer alone. Shadow falls over his pathetic
form.

<b>                          SATAN (O.S.)

John pries his eyes open...

             Hello, John.

<b>                             JOHN

             You're early.

<b>                           SATAN

             You're the one show I wouldn't

<b>                             JOHN

             So I've heard.
Satan sees John's slit wrists.

</b>
             I didn't think you'd make the same
             mistake twice.
John looks up at him.

<b>                           SATAN
</b>
             You didn't, did you?

<b>                           JOHN

             And why would that matter to you?

Satan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies
this dying man.

             This is another one of your cons.

             Go look for yourself...
Satan is still suspicious.

             You've waited twenty years for me,

Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is
overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time --

             Gabriel?
Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel
reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his
might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and
Gabriel has now pierced dead air.
Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John
did. She struggles and the demon inside appears --
reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on
the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON.

<b>                           SATAN

             So... what do you want?   An

ANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain.
Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her
eyes --




<b>EXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY
</b>
Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings,
penduluming up in SLOW MOTION.
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But
this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing.
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for
what seems so close... so close...
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky.

John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes
his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds
himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try
as he might, he can't budge John an inch.
And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if
weightless, begins to rise toward something above.
No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the
embrace of God.
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE --

<b>                        SATAN
</b>
          The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE

<b>          BELONGS TO ME!!
</b>
John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan,
the middle finger fully extended. Final straw.
Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split
second. His hands remain on fire.

<b>                        SATAN

          You will live, John Constantine,
          you will live so you'll have the
          chance to prove that your soul
          truly belongs in Hell. You will
          live!
Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's
body --
John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue --
collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of
diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final
blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over --




<b>INT./EXT. RAVENSCAR
</b>
-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out
across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills
beyond.




<b>INT. CORRIDOR

On his hands and knees, John takes that first breath.
New lungs fill for the first time. No cough. Not even a
wheeze. Face has renewed color. Wrists have sealed
tight.

John is healed.
He stands, steps back inside the --

John stops over the body of one seven-foot African
warrior. He stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion.          A
SOUND draws his attention to the one thing that could
cause him even greater rage --

<b>GABRIEL --
</b>
is hunched over near a wall. Jagged cartilage stumps
protrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is
burned into the floor behind him. It's all that remains
of his once majestic wings.
John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel.
He realizes what this means. Gets a kick out of it.

<b>                            JOHN

Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet
floor.

             Then pass judgment on me now.
John raises the gun -- puts it to Gabriel's forehead.

             Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my

John's finger nudges the trigger.

             ... and I'll be condemned again...

<b>                            GABRIEL
</b>
             Do it!

<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)

<b>CONTINUED:

It takes everything John has not to pull that trigger.
He lowers the gun, shaking his head.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             You're even worthless as bait.
John starts to turn away --

<b>                           GABRIEL
</b>
             Deny your true nature today, but
             what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow
             after that? It is only a matter
             of time before you end up right
             back where you belong. It is who
             you are, Constantine. Damned.
John's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the
entire arc until it ends abruptly against Gabriel's face.
The ex-angel is propelled all the way to the wall --
SLAMS HARD against the concrete. Body crumples on
impact, slides down to the muck. You know this hurt like
absolute hell.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>
             That's called pain.    Get used to it.
John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold.
Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and
Barry. The experience has obviously left them both
drained.
John walks across the room, kneels down to them.

<b>                           ANGELA
</b>
             Thank you, John.
He nods, beat. Wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts
a hand on Barry's shoulder. HOLD a beat ON this gritty
family tableau.




<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - MIDNITE'S UNIVERSAL ORRERY
</b>
MOVING SLOWLY PAST the inoperative device. PAST
strangely-shaped objects of platinum and gold, with names
and symbols that make a bit more sense now.




<b>EXT. AFRICA - DAY
</b>
Huge sun beats down on a lone FIGURE walking across a
stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth. He stops,
kneels to the heavily-cracked soil. Starts digging.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                       118.
</b>




<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY
</b>
A HAND comes in, affixes an unseen object to a protruding
rod. Its weight causes it to drop OUT OF FRAME but a
moment later it rises back INTO VIEW and finds a balance.




<b>EXT. AFRICA
</b>
JOHN pulls back the protective hood from his face.
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life. He pops a
NICORETTE TABLET, then unwraps rolls of cloth from around
the Spear of Destiny. He drops it in the hole, stares at
it a long beat.




<b>INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - THE ORRERY
</b>
The entire mechanism shudders. And now miraculously,
every globe, every moon, every obscure object in this
miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete
sync.
As it does, the defining object finally slides INTO VIEW.
John's lighter.   ANGELA watches it rotate past, nods in
approval.




<b>EXT. AFRICA
</b>
John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred
relic. He stands, nods. Job done.
A breeze blows past and John senses being watched. He
spins and finds -- nothing. For a hundred miles. He
starts walking.

<b>                        JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
          Some people are born to make a
          difference. I had to die. Twice.

<b>                                       MATCH CUT TO:
</b>




<b>EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - ANGELA
</b>
walking right in step. Something is closing in on her.
A new TAXI pulls up. Chaz is driving. Angela gets in.

<b>                        JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
          God does work in mysterious ways.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                     119.
</b>




<b>EXT. AFRICA
</b>
John continues walking as something closes in on him at
incredible speed.

<b>                        JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
          Some people like it...
Our view RISES OVER him and gliding across the barren
landscape are the SHADOW of WINGS.

<b>                        JOHN (V.O.)
</b>
          Some people don't.




<b>                                         FADE OUT.
</b>













<b>                        THE END
