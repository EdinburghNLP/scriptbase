Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) movie scriptby Graham Chapman & John Cleese & Eric Idle & Terry Gilliam & Terry Jones & Michael Palin.Final draft, 20.3.74.
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


Please Read This Bit Before Reading The Screenplay:

This is the official 'Unoffical' Monty Python And The Holy Grail screenplay.
This file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974, before filming took
place.  There are many minor differences from what appears here and what
ended up on the screen.  
This file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film.

I tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isn't
easy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue, in ASCII.
Any Scene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a "" before it.
Anything Penciled in has a "", I also put cut information before penciled in.

What is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out and
what "Catch Phrases" were literally penciled in.  The reason I keyed in
this file was caused by me downloading current transcript going
around internet.  It was an amazing job... I wouldn't want to have attempted
what he did... But it wasn't in a good script format and I didn't like how
direction was written in. Since I HAD the real screenplay I thought...
What the hell!

After This I plan to key in "Monty Python's Second Film" it is the 1st draft
of the Holy Grail. It is the script that eventually got canabalized into
sketches for the 4th season of Python.  It Is sill quite different and well
worth a read. is anybody interested in it?????

Oh yes... I will STRESS this fact once more... THIS IS A SCREENPLAY... So
don't yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the film... This is what was
written before filming took place and it is still quite accurate.

Enough of this...

P.S. TO AHH:  DON'T YOU KNOW WHO CONNIE BOOTH OR CAROL CLEVELAND IS?!?!?!
AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GRAHAM CHAPMAN SOUNDS LIKE?!?!?! Sorry I just had to
say that... As the complete and total bastard that I am.

1  EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY

Mist.  Several seconds of it swirling about.  silence
possibly, atmospheric music.  SUPERIMPOSE "England AD 787".
after a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance.
They come slowly closer.  Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR
followed by a SERVANT who is banging two half coconuts
together.   ARTHUR raises his hand.

               ARTHUR
     Whoa there!

SERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish.  ARTHUR
peers through the mist.  CUT TO shot from over his shoulder:
castle (e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist.  On the castle
battlements a SOLDIER is dimly seen.  He peers down.

               SOLDIER
     Halt!  Who goes there?

               ARTHUR
     It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
     of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons,
     sovereign of all England!

Pause.

               SOLDIER
     Get away!

               ARTHUR
     I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the
     length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join
     our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.

               SOLDIER
     What?  Ridden on a horse?

               ARTHUR
     Yes!

               SOLDIER
     You're using coconuts!

               ARTHUR
     ...What?

               SOLDIER
     You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging
     them together.

               ARTHUR
          (Scornfully)
     So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
     land, through the kingdom of Mercea.

               SOLDIER
     Where did you get the coconuts?

               ARTHUR
     Through ... We found them.

               SOLDIER
     Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!

               ARTHUR
     What do you mean?

               SOLDIER
     Well, this is a temperate zone.

               ARTHUR
     The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin
     or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are
     not strangers to our land.

               SOLDIER
     Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

               ARTHUR
     Not at all.  They could be carried.

               SOLDIER
     What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

               ARTHUR
     Why not?

               SOLDIER
     I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight
     inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky
     to find a coconut under a pound.


               ARTHUR
     It could grip it by the husk ...

               SOLDIER
     It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple
     matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not
     hold a a one pound coconut.

               ARTHUR
     Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that
     Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

A Slight pause.  Swirling mist.  Silence.

               SOLDIER
     Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat
     its wings four hundred and ninety three times every
     second.   right?

               ARTHUR
          (irritated)
     Please!

               SOLDIER
     Am I right?

               ARTHUR
     I'm not interested.

               SECOND SOLDIER
          (who has loomed up on the battlements)
     It could be carried by an African swallow!

               FIRST SOLDIER
     Oh  yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European
     swallow. that's my point.

               SECOND SOLDIER
     Oh yes, I agree there ...

               ARTHUR
          (losing patience)
     Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights
     of Camelot?!

               FIRST SOLDIER
     But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.

               SECOND SOLDIER
     Oh yes.

ARTHUR raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY.  They turn
and go off into the mist.

               FIRST SOLDIER
     So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.

               SECOND SOLDIER

     Wait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?

               FIRST SOLDIER
     No, they'd have to have it on a line.

Stillness.  Silence again.


2  ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE - DEATH AND DEVASTATION

CUT TO Terry Gilliam's sequence of Brueghel prints.  Sounds of
strange medieval music.  Discordant and sparse.  Wailings and
groanings.  The last picture mixes through into live action.
BIG CLOSE UP of contorted face upside down.  A leg falls across
it.  Creaking noise.  The bodies lurch away from CAMERA to
reveal they are amongst a huge pile of bodies on a swaying cart
that is lumbering away from CAMERA.  It is pulled by a couple of
ragged, dirty emaciated WRETCHES.  Behind the cart walks another
MAN who looks slightly more prosperous, but only on the scale
of complete and utter impoverishment.  He wears a black hood and
looks sinister.

               CART DRIVER
     Bring out your dead!

We follow the cart through a wretched, impoverished plague-ridden
village.  A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging.
In the open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of
legs dangling from the ceiling.  In another doorway an OLD WOMAN
is beating a cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat.
The cart passes round a dead donkey or cow in the mud.  And a MAN
tied to a cart is being hammered to death by four NUNS with
huge mallets.

               CART DRIVER

     Bring out your dead!

There are legs stick out of windows and doors.  Two MEN are fighting
in the mud - covered from head to foot in it.  Another MAN is on his
hands in knees shovelling mud into his mouth.  We just catch
sight of a MAN falling into a well.

               CART DRIVER
     Bring out your dead!

               LARGE MAN
     Here's one!

               CART DRIVER
     Ninepence.

               BODY
     I'm not dead!

               CART DRIVER
     What?

               LARGE MAN
     Nothing... There's your ninepence.

               BODY
     I'm not dead!

               CART DRIVER
     'Ere.  He says he's not dead.

               LARGE MAN
     Yes he is.

               BODY
     I'm not!

               CART DRIVER
     He isn't.

               LARGE MAN
     He will be soon. He's very ill.

               BODY
     I'm getting better!

               LARGE MAN
     You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.

               CART DRIVER
     I can't take him like this.  It's against regulations.

               BODY
     I don't want to go on the cart.

               LARGE MAN
     Don't be such a baby.

               CART DRIVER
     I can't take him.

               BODY
     I feel fine.

               LARGE MAN
     Do me a favour.

               CART DRIVER
     I can't.

               LARGE MAN
     Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't
     be long.

               CART DRIVER
     I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine
     today.

               LARGE MAN
     When's your next round?

               CART DRIVER
     Thursday.

               BODY
     I think I'll go for a walk.

               LARGE MAN
     You're not fooling anyone you know.
          (to CART DRIVER)
     Isn't there anything you could do?

               BODY
          (singing unrecognisably)
     I feel happy... I feel happy.

The CART DRIVER looks at the LARGE MAN for a moment.  Then they both
do a quick furtive look up and down the street.  The CART DRIVER
very swiftly brings up a club and hits the OLD MAN. (Out of shot
but the singing stops after a loud bonk noise.)

               LARGE MAN
          (handing over the money at last)
     Thanks very much.

               CART DRIVER
     That's all right.  See you on Thursday.

They turn ... Suddenly all the village fall to their knees, touching
forelocks etc.  ARTHUR and PATSY ride into SHOT, slightly nose to
the air, they ride through without acknowledging anybody.  After
they pass, the LARGE MAN turns to the CART DRIVER.

               LARGE MAN
     Who's that then?

               CART DRIVER
          (Grudgingly)
     I dunno, Must be a king.

               LARGE MAN
     Why?

               CART DRIVER
     He hasn't got shit all over him.


3  EXTERIOR - DAY

ARTHUR and PATSY riding.  They stop and look.  We see a castle in the
distance, and before it a PEASANT is working away on his knees trying
to dig up the earth with his bare hands and a twig.  ARTHUR and
PATSY ride up, and stop before the PEASANT

               ARTHUR
     Old woman!

               DENNIS
     Man!

               ARTHUR
     Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle
     over there?

               DENNIS
     I'm thirty-seven.

               ARTHUR
     What?

               DENNIS:
     I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.

               ARTHUR:
     Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'

               DENNIS
     Well you could say: "Dennis"

               ARTHUR
     I didn't know you were called Dennis.

               DENNIS
     You didn't bother to find out, did you?

               ARTHUR
     I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind
     you looked ...

               DENNIS
     What I object to is that you automatically treat me like
     an inferior ...

               ARTHUR
     Well ... I AM king.

               DENNIS
     Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine
     clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that?
     By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist
     dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our
     society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...

An OLD WOMAN appears.

               OLD WOMAN
     Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh!
     how d'you do?

               ARTHUR
     How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ...
     can you tell me who lives in that castle?

               OLD WOMAN
     King of the WHO?

               ARTHUR
     The Britons.

               OLD WOMAN
     Who are the Britons?

               ARTHUR
     All of us are ... we are all Britons.

DENNIS winks at the OLD WOMAN.

     ... and I am your king ....

               OLD WOMAN
     Ooooh!  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were
     an autonomous collective ...

               DENNIS
     You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship,
     A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes ...

               OLD WOMAN
     There you are, bringing class into it again ...

               DENNIS
     That's what it's all about ...  If only -

               ARTHUR
     Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in
     that castle?

               OLD WOMAN
     No one live there.

               ARTHUR
     Well, who is your lord?

               OLD WOMAN
     We don't have a lord.

               ARTHUR
     What?

               DENNIS
     I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take
     it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.

               ARTHUR
     Yes.

               DENNIS
     ... But all the decision of that officer ...

               ARTHUR
     Yes, I see.

               DENNIS
     ... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority
     in the case of purely internal affairs.

               ARTHUR
     Be quiet!

               DENNIS
     ... but a two-thirds majority ...

               ARTHUR
     Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.

               OLD WOMAN
     Order, eh -- who does he think he is?

               ARTHUR
     I am your king!

               OLD WOMAN
     Well, I didn't vote for you.

               ARTHUR
     You don't vote for kings.

               OLD WOMAN
     Well, how did you become king, then?

               ARTHUR
     The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
     held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by
     Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ...
     That is why I am your king!

               OLD WOMAN
       Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one.

               DENNIS
     Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out
     swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme
     executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from
     some farcical aquatic ceremony.

               ARTHUR
     Be quiet!

               DENNIS
     You can't expect to wield supreme executive power
     just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

               ARTHUR
     Shut up!

               DENNIS
     I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some
     moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would
     put me away!

               ARTHUR
          (Grabbing him by the collar)
     Shut up, will you. Shut up!

               DENNIS
     Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.

               ARTHUR
     Shut up!

PEOPLE (i.e. other PEASANTS) are appearing and watching.

               DENNIS
          (calling)
     Come and see the violence inherent in the system.
     Help, help, I'm being repressed!

               ARTHUR
          (aware that people are now coming out and watching)
     Bloody peasant!
          (pushes DENNIS over into mud and prepares to ride off)

               DENNIS
     Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.

               ARTHUR
     Come on, patsy.

They ride off.

               DENNIS
          (in the background as we PULL OUT)
     did you see him repressing me, then?  That's what I've
     been on about ...


4  EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY

MIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest.  They pass rune
stones.  We TRACK with them.  CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they ride.
MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the forest.  They
come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead intently. Their eyes light up.

Sound FX of fight.

CUT TO their eyeline.  A clearing on the other side of which is a rough
wooden foot-bridge across a stream.   At the start of the bridge a
tremendous fight is going on.  A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armour, his
face totally masked in a visor, is fighting a slightly smaller KNIGHT in
green armour.  (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT's armour is identical to the
BLACK KNIGHT's save for the colour.)

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY.  They watch, growing more impressed
as they watch the fight.

CUT BACK TO the fight.  The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT, who
avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the sword
out of the GREEN KNIGHT's hand.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed.

CUT BACK TO the fight.  The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly nasty
mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK KNIGHT's sword.

ARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive.

CUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT, who
ducks under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to close
on the GREEN KNIGHT.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of the
fight reaching a climax.  Four almighty clangs.  Then Silence.

CUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out.  The BLACK KNIGHT
sheathes his sword.

ARTHUR looks at PATSY.  Nods and they move forward.

CUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his head
and hurling him into the river.  ARTHUR and PATSY approach him.

               ARTHUR
     You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.

               BLACK KNIGHT
       Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?

               ARTHUR
       I do not challenge you.

The BLACK KNIGHT stares impassively and says nothing.

               ARTHUR
     I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

Hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which dosn't come. ARTHUR is
only slightly thrown.

     ... I seek the bravest and the finest knights in all
     the world to join me in my court at Camelot ...

The BLACK KNIGHT remains silent

               ARTHUR
     You have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?

Silence.

               ARTHUR
       A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all
       my knights ...

               BLACK KNIGHT
       Never.

               ARTHUR
     You make me sad.  But so be it.  Come Patsy.

As he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     None shall pass.

               ARTHUR
     What?

               BLACK KNIGHT
     None shall pass.

               ARTHUR
     I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must
     cross this bridge.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Then you shall die.

               ARTHUR
     I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     I move for no man.

               ARTHUR
     So be it!

ARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT.  A furious fight
now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR delivers
a mighty blow which completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm at
the shoulder.  ARTHUR steps back triumphantly.

               ARTHUR
     Now stand aside worthy adversary.

               BLACK KNIGHT
          (Glancing at his shoulder)
     'Tis but a scratch.

               ARTHUR
     A scratch?  Your arm's off.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     No, it isn't.

               ARTHUR
          (Pointing to the arm on ground)
     Well, what's that then?

               BLACK KNIGHT
     I've had worse.

               ARTHUR
     You're a liar.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Come on you pansy!

Another ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHTS's
other arm off, also at the shoulder.  The arm plus sword, lies on the ground.
               ARTHUR
     Victory is mine.
          (sinking to his knees)
     I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Come on then.

               ARTHUR
     What?

He kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet.  ARTHUR gets up still
holding his sword.  The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking.

               ARTHUR
     You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Had enough?

               ARTHUR
     You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Course I have.

               ARTHUR
     Look!

               BLACK KNIGHT
     What!  Just a flesh wound.
          (kicks ARTHUR)

               ARTHUR
     Stop that.

               BLACK KNIGHT
          (kicking him)
     Had enough ... ?

               ARTHUR
     I'll have your leg.

He is kicked.

     Right!

The BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off.
The BLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     I'll do you for that.

               ARTHUR
     You'll what ... ?

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Come Here.

               ARTHUR
     What are you going to do. bleed on me?

               BLACK KNIGHT
     I'm invincible!

               ARTHUR
     You're a looney.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!

ARTHUR takes his last leg off.  The BLACK KNIGHT's body lands upright.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     All right, we'll call it a draw.

               ARTHUR
     Come, Patsy.

ARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge.

               BLACK KNIGHT
     Running away eh?  You yellow bastard, Come back here and take
     what's coming to you.  I'll bite your legs off!


5  EXTERIOR - DAY

A village.  Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short, sharp
cracks.  It comes nearer.  We see it is a line of MONKS ala SEVENTH SEAL
flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with
wooden boards.  They pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful
YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the streets.  They drag her to a
strange house/ruin standing on a hill outside the village.  A
strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR BEDEVERE.

               FIRST VILLAGER
     We have found a witch.  May we burn her?

               ALL
     A Witch! Burn her!

               BEDEVERE
     How do you know she is a witch?

               ALL
     She looks like one. Yes, she does.

               BEDEVERE
     Bring her forward.

They bring her forward - a beautiful YOUNG GIRL (MISS ISLINGTON) dressed up
as a witch.

               WITCH
     I am not a witch.  I am not a witch.

               BEDEVERE
     But you are dressed as one.

               WITCH
     They dressed me up like this.

               ALL
     We didn't, we didn't!

               WITCH
     This is not my nose,  It is a false one.

BEDEVERE takes her nose off.

               BEDEVERE
     Well?

               FIRST VILLAGER
     ... Well, we did do the nose.

               BEDEVERE
     The nose?

               FIRST VILLAGER
     And the hat.  But she is a witch.

               ALL
     A witch,  a witch,  burn her!

               BEDEVERE
     Did you dress her up like this?

               FIRST VILLAGER
     ... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.

               BEDEVERE
     Why do you think she is a witch?

               SECOND VILLAGER
     She turned me into a newt.

               BEDEVERE
     A newt?

               SECOND VILLAGER
          (After looking at himself for some time)
     I got better.

               ALL
     Burn her anyway.

               BEDEVERE
     Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.

ARTHUR and PATSY ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest

               ALL
     There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?

               BEDEVERE
     Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?

               ALL
     Burn them.

               BEDEVERE
     And what do you burn, apart from witches?

               FOURTH VILLAGER
     ... Wood?

               BEDEVERE
     So why do witches burn?

               SECOND VILLAGER
          (pianissimo)
     ... Because they're made of wood...?

               BEDEVERE
     Good.

PEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion.

               ALL
     I see.  Yes, of course.

               BEDEVERE
     So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

               FIRST VILLAGER
     Make a bridge out of her.

               BEDEVERE
     Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

               ALL
     Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...

               BEDEVERE
     Does wood sink in water?

               ALL
     No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To
     the pond.

               BEDEVERE
     Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?

               ALL
     Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...

               ARTHUR
     A duck.

They all turn and look at ARTHUR.  BEDEVERE looks up very impressed.

               BEDEVERE
     Exactly.  So... logically ...

               FIRST VILLAGER
          (beginning to pick up the thread)
     If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

               BEDEVERE
     And therefore?

               ALL
     A witch! ... A duck!  A duck!  Fetch a duck.

               FOURTH VILLAGER
     Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.

               BEDEVERE
     We shall use my largest scales.

He leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed,  made of
wood and rope and leather.  They put the GIRL in one pan and the duck
in another.  Each pan is supported by a wooden stave.  BEDEVERE checks
each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest.

               BEDEVERE
     Remove the supports.

Two PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers.  The GIRL and the duck
swing slightly but balance perfectly.

               ALL
     A witch!  A witch!

               WITCH
     It's a fair cop.

               All
     Burn her!  Burn her!  Let's make her into a ladder.

The VILLAGERS drag the girl away, leaving ARTHUR and BEDEVERE regarding
each other admiringly.

               BEDEVERE
     Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?

               ARTHUR
     I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

               BEDEVERE
     My liege ... forgive me ...

ARTHUR looks at PATSY with obvious satisfaction.


               ARTHUR
     Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
     and join our number at the Round Table?

               BEDEVERE
     My liege,  I am honored.

ARTHUR steps forward, drawing his sword, with a slight hint of difficulty

               ARTHUR
     What is your name?

               BEDEVERE
     Bedevere, my Liege.

               ARTHUR
     Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!


6  VARIOUS MONTAGE - ANIMATION

               VOICE OVER
     And so King Arthur gathered his knights together ... bringing from all
     the corners of the kingdom the strongest and bravest in the land ...
     To sit at The Round Table ...

   Under this voice over we have a montage of shots of ARTHUR recruiting
   his Knights:

   1.   ARTHUR, PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE riding through hillside.
          MIX TO:

   2.   A castle.  LONG SHOT of SIR GAWAIN standing outside and ARTHUR's
          group approaching and shaking hands perhaps.

   3.   MIX TO the group now plus SIR GAWAIN and PAGE (who is weighted
          down by an enormous quantity of luggage) riding down by a stream
          and approaching SIR HECTOR.  ARTHUR dubs him.

   4.   MIX TO the group (now plus HECTOR and PAGE) approaching some group
          of buildings or whatever.  In the distance SIR ROBIN is being taught
          the lute by one of his MUSICIANS.  ARTHUR calls and SIR ROBIN
          immediately reacts and hands the lute to his MUSICIAN and comes to
          join ARTHUR & CO.

   5.   MIX TO SIR GALAHAD surrounded by chickens.  He is wearing a carpenters
          apron over his immaculate armour and is finishing off a hen-house.
          We see the group approach and he throws off the apron and puts down
          the hen-house and goes to join them.

   6.   MIX TO the group riding along again.

   7.   MIX TO SIR LAUNCELOT handing a BABY to his WIFE (who has several other
          CHILDREN hanging about) and he strides off to join ARTHUR, leaving his
          castle, WIFE and CHILDREN.  The castle (Eilean Donan) has washing
          hanging outside it.  A real family castle.  There are at least
          six kids.

   8.   MIX TO the complete group, i.e. ARTHUR and PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE,
          GAWAIN and PAGE, HECTOR and PAGE, GALAHAD and PAGE, SIR ROBIN and
          six MUSICIANS, LAUNCELOT and PAGE.

7  EXTERIOR - SUNSET

Fairly close HEAD-ON SHOT of the KNIGHTS riding along. BEDEVERE and ARTHUR
at the front of the group deep in conversation.

               BEDEVERE
     And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.

               ARTHUR
     This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how
     sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

               BEDEVERE
     OF course, my Liege ...

               LAUNCELOT
          (he points)
     Look, my liege!

They all stop and look.

               ARTHUR
          (with thankful reverence)
     Camelot!

CUT TO shot of amazing castle in the distance.  Illuminated in the rays of
the setting sun.

Music.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and the group.  They are all staring with fascination.

               GALAHAD
     Camelot ...

               LAUNCELOT
     Camelot ...

               GAWAIN
          (at the back, to PAGE)
     It's only a model.

               ARTHUR
          (turning sharply)
     Sh!
          (to the rest)
     Knights!  I bid you welcome to your new home!  Let us ride ...
     to Camelot.


8  INTERIOR - NIGHT

CUT TO interior of medieval hall.  A large group of armoured KNIGHTS are
engaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very up-beat
'If they could see me now' type of fast bouncy number.  The poorer verses
are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights actually engaged in
the described task while the line itself is sung.  They sing:

               KNIGHTS
     We're knights of the round table
     We dance whene'er we're able
     We do routines and chorus scenes
     With footwork impeccable.
     We dine well here in Camelot
     We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.

     We're knights of the Round Table
     Our shows are formidable
     But many times
     We're given rhymes
     That are quite unsingable
     We're opera mad in Camelot
     We sing from the diaphragm a lot.

Booming basses.  A routine where two XYLOPHONISTS play parts of KNIGHTS'
armour producing a pleasing effect.

     In war we're tough and able.
     Quite indefatigable
     Between our quests
     We sequin vests
     And impersonate Clark Gable
     It's a busy life in Camelot.

               SINGLE MAN
     I have to push the pram a lot.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and COMPANY as we had left them.

               ARTHUR
     No, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.

               KNIGHTS
     Right!

               ARTHUR
     It is a silly place.

They set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance
and strange heavenly choir music.  The PAGES, horselike, take fright for a
moment, they whinny and rattle their coconuts.  ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS
fall on their knees.  A holy voice booms out.

               GOD
     Arthur!  Arthur ...  King of the Britons ...

They all prostrate themselves even further

     Oh, don't grovel ... do get up!  If there's one thing I can't stand,
     it's people grovelling!!

ARTHUR and COMPANY rise.

               ARTHUR
     Sorry ...

               GOD
     And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's
     sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ...
     What are you doing now?

               ARTHUR
     I'm averting my eyes, Lord.

               GOD
     Well, don't.
       I really don't know where all this got started.
     It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing.
     Now knock it of

               ARTHUR
     Yes, Lord.

               GOD
     Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round
     Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...

               ARTHUR
     Good idea, O Lord!

               GOD
     Course it's a good idea.

Suddenly another light glows beside GOD or possibly within the light which
is GOD a shape slowly starts to form.

     Behold ... Arthur ... this is the Holy Grail ...
       the Sacred Cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper ...

The form in the bright light is just discernible as an iridescent chalice
... the KNIGHTS gasp.

     Look well, Arthur ... for it is your sacred task to seek
     this Grail.

It begins to fade.  Music crescendo as both lights fade.

     That is your purpose Arthur ... the Quest for the Holy Grail ...

It is gone.  All the KNIGHTS are left gasping in awe and wonderment.  They
all turn and look at ARTHUR.

               LAUNCELOT
     A Blessing.  A blessing from the lord.

               BEDEVERE
       Praise be to God!

  An awed pause, then ARTHUR rallies them.

               ARTHUR
       We have a task,  we must waste no time! To Camelot!

               GALAHAD
       God be praised!

Stirring music crescendo.  They ride off.

9  EXTERIOR - CASTLE - DAY

MIX THROUGH one or two shots of them on their way again, until they approach
a terrific castle (a little one would do too).  They advance quite close to
the castle and draw themselves into a line.  At a signal from ARTHUR the two
PAGES step forward and give a brief fanfare.

A MAN appears on the battlements.  ARTHUR addresses him.

               ARTHUR
     Hello.

               MAN
     'Allo.  Whoo is eet?

               ARTHUR
     I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round
     Table.  Whose castle is this?

               MAN
     This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

               ARTHUR
     Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God
     with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for
     this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.

               MAN
     Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.
     He's already got one, you see?

               ARTHUR
     What?

               GALAHAD
     He says they've already got one!

They are stunned.

               ARTHUR
     Are you sure he's got one?

               MAN
     Oh yes.  It's very nice

  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER (MAN) turns to some others.

               MAN
       I told him we already got one.

  They all giggle.


               ARTHUR
     Well ... can we come up and have a look?

               MAN
     Of course not!  You are English pigs.

               ARTHUR
     Well, what are you then?

               MAN
     I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you
     silly king.

               GALAHAD
     What are you doing in England?

               MAN
     Mind your own business.

               ARTHUR
     If you will not show us the Grail we shall storm your castle.

Murmurs of assent.

               MAN
     You don't frighten us, English pig-dog!  Go and boil your
     bottoms, son of a silly person.  I blow my nose on you, so-called
     Arthur-king, you and your silly English K...kaniggets.

He puts hands to his ears and blows a raspberry.

               GALAHAD
     What a strange person.

               ARTHUR
     Now look here, my good man!

               MAN
     I don't want to talk to you, no more, you empty-headed animal,
     food trough wiper.  I fart in your general direction.  You mother
     was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.

               GALAHAD
     Is there someone else up there we could talk to?

               MAN
     No.  Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time.

               ARTHUR
     Now this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonab...

               MAN
       Fetchez la vache!

               GUARD
       Quoi?

               MAN
       Fetchez la vache!

CUT BACK TO battlements.  A cow is led out of a stall.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR.

               ARTHUR
     Now that is my final offer.  If you are not prepared to agree to my
     demands I shall be forced to take ... Oh Christ!

A cow comes flying over the battlements,  lowing aggressively.  The cow
lands on GALAHAD'S PAGE, squashing him completely.

               ROBIN
       What a cruel thing to do.

               BEDEVERE
            (Choking back tears)
       It hadn't even been milked.

               ARTHUR
     Right! Knights! Forward!

ARTHUR leads a charge toward the castle.  Various shots of them battling on,
despite being hit by a variety of farm animals.

               ARTHUR
          (as the MAN next to him is squashed by a sheep)
     Knights!  Run away!

Midst echoing shouts of "run away" the KNIGHTS retreat to cover with the odd
cow or goose hitting them still.  The KNIGHTS crouch down under cover.

               LAUNCELOT
     The sods!  I'll tear them apart.

               ARTHUR
          (restraining LAUNCELOT from going out and having a go)
     No!

               BEDEVERE
     I have a plan sir.

CUT BACK TO battlements of castle.  FRENCH SENTRIES suspiciously peering
towards the English lines.  Wind whistles.

Shot of the empty scrubland or undergrowth or woodland around the castle.
Emptiness.  Wind.  More shots of the FRENCH SENTRIES peering into the dusk.
  As night falls.  MIX THROUGH TO night On the battlements a brazier burns or
  torches on the wall as the SENTRIES peer into the dark. Shots of the
  woodland with fires burning where the English lines are.

During all this the sounds of extensive carpentry have possibly been herd,
followed by silence, followed by renewed outbursts or activity.

CLOSE-UP FRENCH looking very nervous.  Dawn breaking. Shot of woodland.
Nothing.  Wind.  Dawn still breaking.  Shots of the FRENCH.  They suddenly
hear something.  A faintly detectable squeaking which is getting louder.

CUT TO WIDE SHOT of castle and woodland.  Squeaking getting louder.  Shot of
the FRENCH TAUNTER pointing.  WIDE SHOT again.  The squeaking gets louder
an enormous twenty-foot-high wooden rabbit is wheeled out of the
undergrowth into the open space in front of the castle.  The ENGLISH scuttle
back into the undergrowth.  The rabbit has a large red bow tied round it
and a rather crudely written label,  which reads "Pour votres amis
Francais". The CHIEF TAUNTER looks at it, narrowing his eyes.  Then he
turns and leaves battlements.

CUT TO ARTHUR and COMPANY watching from the bushes.  The main gate of the
castle opens a little and the CHIEF TAUNTER's head sticks out,  then another
Froggie head,  then another.  They mutter to each other in French,  look
rather pleased,  then rush out and start to pull the giant rabbit in.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and COMPANY behind some bushes watching.

               ARTHUR
     Now what happens?

               BEDEVERE
     Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall
     and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise,
     not only by surprise but totally unarmed!

               ARTHUR
     Who ... Who breaks out?

               BEDEVERE
     Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the
     rabbit and ...

LAUNCELOT covers his eyes.

               BEDEVERE
     Look, if we were to build a large wooden badger...

ARTHUR cuffs him.  ARTHUR looks at the battlements.  There is a loud twang.
Look of horror.  The rabbit comes sailing over the battlements.


               ARTHUR
     Run away!

More shouts.

     Run away!

               SIR GAWAIN
            (to his PAGE as they run away)
       It's only a model.

               ARTHUR
       Sh!

They continue to retreat.  The rabbit lands on GAWAIN'S PAGE
(who is already weighed down by enormous quantity of luggage).


10  EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY

 CUT TO a MAN in modern dress standing outside a castle.  He speaks straight
 to CAMERA in a documentary kind of way.

 SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:  A Very Famous Historian.

               HISTORIAN'S SPEECH
     Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened
     King Arthur ... The ferocity of the French taunting took him
     completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy
     was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought
     to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest
     knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail
     individually.  Now, this is what they did.  No sooner...

 A KNIGHT rides into shot and hacks him to the ground.  He rides off.

 We stay for a moment on the glade.  A MIDDLE-AGED LADY in a C. & A.
 twin-set emerges from the trees and looks in horror at the body of her
 HUSBAND.

               MRS HISTORIAN
     FRANK!

 CUT TO animated frame,  with the words "The Tale of Sir Robin" on it.
 Pleasant pastoral music.  MIX THROUGH TO:
   VOICE: "The Tale Of Sir Robin"


11  EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY

 A KNIGHT is trotting along through a wooden sun-dapled glade, followed by
 his trusty PAGE banging the usual half coconuts.  As we see them approach
 we hear the beautiful lilting sound of medieval music, and see that
 the KNIGHT is followed by a small retinue of MUSICIANS in
 thirteenth-century courtly costume, one sings, and plays the tambourine,
 one bangs at a tabor (A small drum O.E.D) and one plays the pipes.

 The KNIGHT looks very proud and firm as we hear the first part of the song,
 but the combination of the lyrics and the large signs they pass, start
 to have their effect ...

 SONG:

     Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot,
     He was not afraid to die, Oh Brave Sir Robin,
     He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways
     Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.

     He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp
     Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken;
     To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away
     And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.

     His head smashed in,  and his heart cut out,
     And his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged,
     And his nostrils raped, and his bottom burned off,
     And his penis split ... and his ...

               ROBIN
     Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads.
     It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.

               SINGERS
     Brave, Sir Rob ...

               ROBIN
     Shut up.

They have ridden past the following signs, all in triplicate:-

     ------------------------------------------------------
      CAMELOT 43                              CERTAIN DEATH I

   BEWARE               GO BACK          DEAD PEOPLE ONLY
 ------------------------------------------------------------


12 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY

They now pass three KNIGHTS impaled to a tree.  With their feet off the
ground,  with one lance through the lot of them, they are skewered up
like a barbecue.

Then they pass three KNIGHTS sitting on the ground with one enormous axe
through their skulls.  They look timorous.

  Then a huge tree is absolutely packed with MAIDENS tied to it.  They all
  look fed up.  SIR ROBIN calls out cheerfully as he passes.

               ROBIN
       Morning.

               ONE LADY
       Bye.

SIR ROBIN rides on a little way with the music building up enormous and
terrifying tension, until suddenly there standing before him is an
enormous THREE-HEADED KNIGHT.

               THREE HEADS
     Halt!  Who art thou?

               SINGERS
     He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...

               ROBIN
          (to SINGERS)
     Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.

               THREE HEADS
     What do you want?

               SINGERS
     To fight and ...

               ROBIN
     Shut up.  Nothing really.  just to pass through, good Sir knight.

               THREE HEADS
     I'm afraid not.
       This is my bit of the forest.  Find your own bit.

               ROBIN
     I am a Knight of King Arthur's Round Table.
       I seek the Holy Grail - Stand aside and let me pass.

               THREE HEADS
     You are a Knight of the Round Table?

               ROBIN
     I am.

From now on the THREE HEADS speak individually.

               SECOND HEAD
     Shit.

               FIRST HEAD
     In that case I shall have to kill you.

               SECOND HEAD
     Shall I?

               THIRD HEAD
     Oh, I don't think so.

               SECOND HEAD
     I'm not sure.

               MIDDLE HEAD
          (to FIRST)
     What do I think?

               LEFT HEAD
     I think kill him.

               SECOND HEAD
       I'm still not sure.

               THIRD HEAD
       All right.  How many of me think I should kill him?

               FIRST HEAD
       I do.

               THIRD HEAD
       One.

               SECOND HEAD
       That's not a quorum.

               FIRST HEAD
       It is if I'm the Chairman.

               THIRD HEAD
       Oo, it's not.

               SECOND HEAD
       I'm the Chairman this week.

               FIRST HEAD
       You're not.

               SECOND HEAD
       Look, it'll make it much simpler if I vote with me.

               THIRD HEAD
       To kill him.

               SECOND HEAD
       Yeah.

               THIRD HEAD
            (tuts)
       Oh, damn.

               FIRST HEAD
           (to SIR ROBIN)
       Knight, I have decided to kill you.

               THIRD HEAD
       With one absenting.

               FIRST HEAD
       Knight, I have decided to kill you with one absenting.

               THIRD HEAD
            (to SIR ROBIN)
       Sorry about this but I have to be fair.

               ROBIN
       Oh, that's all right.  So you are going to kill me with your big axe.

               FIRST HEAD
       Er no, with my sword.

               SECOND HEAD
       Dagger.

               THIRD HEAD
       Mace is quicker.

               FIRST HEAD
       No, no, the sword, it's easier.

               THIRD HEAD
       He said axe.

               ROBIN
       Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut your head off.

               THIRD HEAD
            (to SIR ROBIN, referring to FIRST HEAD)
       For God's sake, CUT that one off, and do us all a favour.

               FIRST HEAD
       What do you mean?

               THIRD HEAD
       Yapping on all the time.

               SECOND HEAD
       You're lucky, you're not next to him.

               THIRD HEAD
       What do you mean?

               SECOND HEAD
       You snore.

               THIRD HEAD
       Oo, lies.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.

               SECOND HEAD
            (aspirating heavily)
       I haven't.

  Both THIRD and FIRST HEADS turn away slightly, making faces.

               SECOND HEAD
       It's not my fault.  It's what you both eat.

               FIRST HEAD
       Look, stop this bitching.  We've got a knight to kill.

               SECOND HEAD
       He's buggered off.

               THIRD HEAD
       So he has.  He's scarpered.

               FIRST HEAD
       That's all your fault.

               THIRD HEAD
       No, it's not.

               FIRST HEAD
            (swipes at himself)
       Take that.

               SECOND HEAD
       Ow.

               FIRST HEAD
       I'm sorry.

               THIRD HEAD
       'Ere, stop it.  I'll teach you.

  The BODY starts laying into itself with sword and mace, while the HEADS
  argue and shout with pain.  We PAN gently across to the MAIDENS on their
  tree.  They are still very fed up.

               MAIDEN
       I suppose we're lucky he's only got three heads.

               LOVELY
       Chance would be a fine thing.

               THIRD HEAD
       Oh! let's be nice to him.

               FIRST HEAD
       Oh shut up.

               ROBIN
       Perhaps I could ...

               FIRST HEAD
       Oh! quick! get the sword out I want to cut his head off.

               THIRD HEAD
       Oh, cut your own head off.

               SECOND HEAD
       Yes - do us all a favour.

               FIRST HEAD
       What?

               THIRD HEAD
       Yapping on all the time.

               SECOND HEAD
       You're lucky, you're not next to him.

               THIRD HEAD
       What do you mean?

               SECOND HEAD
       You snore.

               THIRD HEAD
       Ooh, lies! anyway you've got bad breath.

               SECOND HEAD
       Well only because you don't brush my teeth ...

               THIRD HEAD
       Oh! stop bickering and let's go and have tea and biscuits.

               FIRST HEAD
       All right! All right! We'll kill him first and then have tea
       and biscuits.

               SECOND HEAD
       Yes.

               THIRD HEAD
       Oh! not biscuits ...

               FIRST HEAD
       All right! All right! not biscuits - but lets kill him anyway ...

  WIDE-SHOT THE 3-HEADED KNIGHT is alone.

               SECOND HEAD
       He's buggered off!

               THIRD HEAD
       So he has! He's scarpered.


13 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY

Quick sequence of SIR ROBIN.  The music is jolly and bright, as if
triumphant.  ROBIN is not at all happy with the lyrics.

               SINGERS
     Brave Sir Robin ran away.

               ROBIN
     I didn't.

               SINGERS
     Bravely ran away, away.

               ROBIN
     No, no, no.

               SINGERS
     When danger reared its ugly head,
     He bravely turned his tail and fled
     Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
     And gallantly he chickened out
     Bravely taking to his feet
     He beat a very brave retreat
     Bravest of the brave Sir Robin
     Petrified of being dead
     Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin
     Turned away and fled.

They disappear into distance.

ANIMATION:  "The Tale Of Sir Galahad"


14 EXTERIOR - STORM - FOREST - DUSK

As the storm rages we pick up GALAHAD forcing his way through brambles and
over slippery rocks.  Progress is hard.  He pauses and at this moment
we hear the howling of wolves.  GALAHAD turns, then hurries onward even
more urgently.  Another louder, closer howl is herd and GALAHAD stumbles
and falls heavily.  Though obviously injured he bravely struggles
forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain.  More louder
closer howling.  He grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around
a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle,
perhaps looking rather derelict.  He makes up his mind in an instant and
stumbles manfully toward it.  More louder howling.  He reaches the
forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the
handle of his sword, looking over his shoulder the while.  Pause.
He beats again, shouting:

               GALAHAD
     Open.  Open the doors.  In the name of King Arthur.  Open the doors.
       I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.

  Some suitable noises are herd inside.

       I am on a quest for the Holy Grail.  I seek shelter.

Some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being
drawn.  The wolves' howling is very close.  As the door creaks
open GALAHAD steps quickly inside.

15 INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT

From inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and turn
as the door crashes behind him.  GALAHAD turns to the door reacting to the
fact he is trapped.

               ZOOT (OUT OF VISION)
     Hello!

GALAHAD turns back.  We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by him
smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES draped
around in the seductively poulticed room.  They look at him smilingly and
wave.

               GIRLIES
     Hello!

               ZOOT
     Welcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

               GALAHAD
     The Castle Anthrax?

               ZOOT
     Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are
     nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!

               GALAHAD
     Er ...
       You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

               ZOOT
     The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget!
     Crapper!

               MIDGET AND CRAPPER
     Yes, O Zoot?

               ZOOT
     Prepare a bed for our guest.

               MIDGET AND CRAPPER
          (grovelling with delight)
     Oh thank you, Zoot, thank you, thank you.

               ZOOT
     Away varletesses!
          (to GALAHAD)
     The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.

               GALAHAD
     Well, look er, I ...

               ZOOT
     What is your name, handsome knight?

               GALAHAD
     Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.

               ZOOT
     Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot
          (she is very close to him for a moment)
     But come.

She turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading
to the bedchamber

               GALAHAD
     Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...

               ZOOT
     Sir Galahad!!

There is a gasp from the other GIRLS

               ZOOT
     You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.

GALAHAD looks at the other GIRLS.  They are clearly on the verge of
being offended.

               GALAHAD
     Well ...

               ZOOT
          (she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows)
     I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared
     to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between
     sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no
     one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ...
     dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....

They reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber.
ZOOT turns

               ZOOT
     We are just not used to handsome knights ...
          (she notices him limping)
     But you are wounded!

               GALAHAD
     No, It's nothing!

               ZOOT
     You must see the doctors immediately.
           (she claps again)
     You must lie down.

She almost forces him to lie on the bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter the
room.  They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically.  They
approach GALAHAD.

               PIGLET
     Well,  what seems to be the trouble?

               GALAHAD
     They're doctors?

               ZOOT
     They have a basic medical training, yes.  Now you must try to rest.
     Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet!  Practice your art!!

               WINSTON
     Try to relax.

               GALAHAD
     No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

               PIGLET
     We must examine you.

               GALAHAD
     There's nothing wrong with ... that.

               PIGLET
          (slightly irritated)
     Please ... we are doctors.

ZOOT reappears.  GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax.  Then there is
a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour.  WINSTON glances quickly
in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and starts getting off the
bed and collecting his armour, saying:

               GALAHAD
     No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!

               PIGLET
     Back to your bed!  At once!

               GALAHAD
     I'm sorry, I must go.

GALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it.  As he leaves the room
we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing
and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and beautiful.  They smile
enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by
the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs.  He nods to them stiffly once
or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY.
He visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying:

               GALAHAD
       Good evening ... Ah, Zoot!  Er ...

               DINGO
       No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.

               GALAHAD
       Oh.  Well, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.

               DINGO
            (very dramatically)
       No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot.

               GALAHAD
       Er, why?

               DINGO
       She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to
       stay for ever!

               GALAHAD
       Oh!

               GALAHAD
       Oh ... will you excuse me?

               DINGO
       Where are you going?

               GALAHAD
       I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!

               DINGO
       No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot!

               GALAHAD
       What is it?

               DINGO
       Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting fire to our beacon,
       which - I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ...  It is not the
       first time we've had this problem.

               GALAHAD
       It's not the real Grail?

               DINGO
     Wicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the
     penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment
     ... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her.  Come!

               GIRLS
     A spanking!  A spanking!

               DINGO
     You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you
     may deal with her as you like and then ... spank me.

               AMAZING
     And spank me!

               STUNNER
     And me.

               LOVELY
     And me.

               DINGO
     Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!

               GIRLS
     A spanking.  A spanking.  There is going to be a spanking tonight.

               DINGO
     And after the spanking ... the oral sex.

               GALAHAD
     Oh, dear! Well, I...

               GIRLS
     The oral sex ...  The oral sex.

               GALAHAD
     Well, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.

At this moment there is a commotion behind and SIR LAUNCELOT and CONCORD,
possibly plus GAWAIN, burst into the bathing area with swords drawn and
form themselves round SIR GALAHAD threatening the GIRLS.

               LAUNCELOT
     Sir Galahad!

               GALAHAD
     Oh ... hello ...

               LAUNCELOT
     Quick!

               GALAHAD
     Why?

               LAUNCELOT
     You are in great peril.

               DINGO
     No he isn't

               LAUNCELOT
     Silence! Foul temptress!

               GALAHAD
     Well, she's got a point.

               LAUNCELOT
     We'll cover your escape!

               GALAHAD
     Look - I'm fine!

               GIRLS
     Sir Galahad!

He threatens DINGO.

               GALAHAD
     No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!

               GIRLS
     Yes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!

               LAUNCELOT
     Come Sir Galahad, quickly!

               GALAHAD
     No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!

               DINGO
     Yes, let him handle us easily.

               LAUNCELOT
     No sir.  Quick!


He starts pulling GALAHAD away.

               GALAHAD
     No, please.  Please! I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred.

               GIRLS
     He will beat us easily.  We haven't a chance.

               DINGO
     Oh shit!

By now LAUNCELOT and CONCORDE have hustled GALAHAD out of the bathing
area and are running through the outside door.

               LAUNCELOT
     We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.

               GALAHAD
          (dragging his feet somewhat)
     I don't think I was.

               LAUNCELOT
     You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.

               GALAHAD
     Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?

               LAUNCELOT
     It's too perilous.

They are right outside the castle by now.

               GALAHAD
     Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.

               LAUNCELOT
     No, no, we must find the Grail.

The thunderstorm is over.  A bunch (sic) of PAGES are tethered to a tree with
more MEN waiting.  Their tethers are untied and the PAGES start banging away
with their coconuts.  GALAHAD is swept along with them as they ride off.

               GALAHAD
     Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?

               LAUNCELOT
     No.  It's unhealthy.

               GALAHAD
     ... I Bet you're gay.

               LAUNCELOT
     No, I'm not.

GAWAIN or CONCORDE gives a knowing glance at LAUNCELOT.  VOICE comes in as
they ride off.

               VOICE OVER
     Sir Launcelot had saved Galahad from almost certain
     temptation but they were still lost, far from the goal
     of their search for the Holy Grail.  Only Bedevere and
     King Arthur himself, riding day and night, had made
     any progress.


16  ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION

 ARTHUR and BEDEVERE in the depths of a dark forest with an old blind
 SOOTHSAYER.  He lies in a broken down old woodman's hut.

               ARTHUR
     And this "Enchanter" of whom you speak,  he has seen the grail?

The SOOTHSAYER laughs forbiddingly, adding to the general spookiness of
this encounter.

               ARTHUR
     Where does he live?
          (he stares into the blind eyes of the OLD MAN)
     Old man ... where does he live ...

               SOOTHSAYER
     He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.

               ARTHUR
     And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?

The BLIND MAN laughs again to himself.

               SOOTHSAYER
     There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge
     of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.

               ARTHUR
     But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?

               SOOTHSAYER
     Seek you the Bridge of Death ...

               ARTHUR
     The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?

The OLD MAN laughs sinisterly and mockingly.  They look down and he is
gone.  They stand up.  Suddenly behind them is a noise.  They turn sharply
in the door of the little hut is a cat.  It miaows and is gone.  They
slowly back out of the hut.  As they touch the doorposts they just flake
away into dust.  The whole hut is rotten.  It collapses

Spooky music.  They are thoroughly shaken, and they begin to hear noises of
people moving in the forest around them.  They start to back cautiously
away from the hut, suddenly there is heavy footfall behind them.  They
turn in fear and:

Sudden CUT TO BIG CLOSE-UP of a frightening black-browed evil face.

               TALL KNIGHT OF NI
     Ni!

ARTHUR and BEDEVERE recoil in abject fear.  PATSY rears up with coconuts.

               ARTHUR
          (to PATSY)
     Easy ... boy, easy ...

ARTHUR peers into the darkness.

     Who are you?

               SIX VOICES FROM DARKNESS
     NI! ... Peng! ... Neeee ... Wom!

An extraordinary TALL KNIGHT in all black (possibly John with Mike on his
shoulders) walks out from the dark trees.  He is extremely fierce and
gruesome countenance.  He walks towards KING ARTHUR and PATSY, who are
wazzing like mad.  (Salopian slang, meaning very scared.  almost to the
point of wetting oneself, e.g. before an important football match or
prior to a postering.  Salopian slang meaning a beating by the school
praeposters.  Sorry about the Salopian slant to this stage direction - Ed.)

               ARTHUR
          (wazzed stiff)
     Who are you?
               TALL KNIGHT
     We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!

               BEDEVERE
     No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!

               TALL KNIGHT
     The same!

               ARTHUR
     Who are they?

               TALL KNIGHT
     We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee
     ... Wom!

               BEDEVERE
     Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.

               TALL KNIGHT
     The Knights Who Say "Ni"! demand a sacrifice.

               ARTHUR
          (to the TALL KNIGHT)
     Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the
     Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...

               TALL KNIGHT
     NI!

               ARTHUR
          (recoiling)
     Oh!

               TALL KNIGHT
     NI!   NI!

               ARTHUR
          (he cowers in fear)
     Oh!

               TALL KNIGHT
     We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.

               ARTHUR
     All right!  What do you want?

               TALL KNIGHT
     We want ... a shrubbery!

               ARTHUR
     A what?

               TALL KNIGHT
     Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!

The PAGES rear and snort and rattle their coconuts.

               ARTHUR
     All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you
     a shrubbery ...

               TALL KNIGHT
     You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall
     not pass through this wood alive!

               ARTHUR
     Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will
     return with a shrubbery.

               TALL KNIGHT
     One that looks nice.

               ARTHUR
     Of course.

               TALL KNIGHT
     And not too expensive.

               ARTHUR
     Yes ...

               TALL KNIGHT
     Now - go!

ARTHUR and BEDEVERE turn and ride off.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     Ni!  Ni!

Shouts of "Ni" and "Peng" ring behind them.


17 EXTERIOR - DAY

CUT BACK TO the HISTORIAN lying in the glade.  His WIFE, who has been
kneeling beside him, rises as two POLICE PATROLMEN enter the glade.
They bend over her HUSBAND.  One takes out a notebook.

CUT TO and animated title - "The Tale of Sir Launcelot"


18 INTERIOR - PRINCE'S ROOM IN CASTLE - DAY

A young, quite embarrassingly unattractive PRINCE is gazing out of a castle
window.  His FATHER stands beside him.  He is also looking out.  The
PRINCE wears a long white undershirt (like a night shirt).

               FATHER
     One day, lad, all this will be yours ...

               PRINCE
     What - the curtains?

               FATHER
     No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...
          (indicates the vista from the window)
     all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and
     valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ...
     that'll be your kingdom, lad.

               PRINCE
     But, Mother ...

               FATHER
     Father, lad.

               PRINCE
     But, Father, I don't really want any of that.

               FATHER
     Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when
     I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a
     castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em.
     It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank
     into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN
     sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up.
     ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in
     this island.

               PRINCE
     But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...

               FATHER
     Rather what?

               PRINCE
     I'd rather ... just ... sing ...

MUSIC INTRO

               FATHER
     You're not going to do a song while I'm here!

Music stops.

     Listen, lad, in twenty minutes you're going to be married to
     a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

               PRINCE
     I don't want land.

               FATHER
     Listen, Alice ...

               PRINCE
     Herbert.

               FATHER
     Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all
     the land we can get.

               PRINCE
     But I don't like her.

               FATHER
     Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ...
     she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...

               PRINCE
     I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ...
     a certain ... special ... something ...

MUSIC INTO FOR song.

               FATHER
     Cut that out!

Music cuts off abruptly.

     You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!
     Guards!

TWO GUARDS enter and stand to attention on either side of the door
One of them has hiccoughs and does so throughout.

               FATHER
     Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until
     I come and get him.

               FIRST GUARD
     Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.

               FATHER
     No.  Until I come and get him.

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FIRST GUARD
     Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.

               FATHER
     No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.

               FIRST GUARD
     ... and you'll come and get him.

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FATHER
     That's Right.

               FIRST GUARD
     We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him
     entering the room.

               FATHER
     Leaving the room.

               FIRST GUARD
     Leaving the room ... yes.

               FATHER
     Got it?

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

FARTHER makes to leave.

               FIRST GUARD
     Er ... if ... we ... er ...

               FATHER
     Yes?

               FIRST GUARD
     If we ... er ...
          (trying to remember what he was going to say)

               FATHER
     Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't
     leave the room.

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FATHER
     Right?

               FIRST GUARD
     Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?

               FATHER
          (carefully)
     No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...

               FIRST GUARD
     Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had
     to leave and we were with him.

               FATHER
     No ... just keep him in here.

               FIRST GUARD
     Until you, or anyone else ...

               FATHER
     No, not anyone else - just me.

               FIRST GUARD
     Just you ...

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FIRST GUARD
     Get back.

               FATHER
     Right.

               FIRST GUARD
     Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.

               FATHER
     And make sure he doesn't leave.

               FIRST GUARD
     What?

               FATHER
     Make sure he doesn't leave.

               FIRST GUARD
     The Prince ... ?

               FATHER
     Yes ...  make sure ...

               FIRST GUARD
     Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!
          (he points to the other GUARD and laughs to himself)
     You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when
     he's a guard ...

               FATHER
     Is that clear?

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FIRST GUARD
   Oh, yes.  That's quite clear.  No problems.

FATHER pulls open the door and makes to leave the room.  The GUARDS follow.

               FATHER
          (to the GUARDS)
     Where are you going?

               FIRST GUARD
     We're coming with you.

               FATHER
     No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave
     the room until I get back.

               FIRST GUARD
     Oh, I see,  Right.

They take up positions on either side of the door.

               PRINCE
     But, Father.

               FATHER
     Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!

 He points to a wedding suit on a table or chair.  FATHER throws one last
 look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door.

 The PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the window.
 MUSIC INTRO to song ...

 The door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in.

               FATHER
      And no singing!

               SECOND GUARD
     Hic.

               FATHER
          (as he goes out.)
     Go and have a drink of water.

FATHER slams the door again.  The GUARDS take up their positions.  The SON
gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought strikes him
... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales
it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall ... and fires the arrow
out of the window.

He looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly.


15 EXTERIOR - A FOREST - DAY

CUT TO the middle of the forest.  SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with
a trusty servant, CONCORDE.

               LAUNCELOT
     And ... o v e r ...  we go!

He strides over a big tree trunk ... his "horse" does run and jump ...

               LAUNCELOT
          (enthusiastically)
     Well taken, Concorde!

               CONCORDE
     Thank you, sir, most kind ...

               LAUNCELOT
     And another!

CONCORDE misses a beat.

     Steady!  Good ... and the last one ...

CONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts.  He does the break for the
leap ... there is a thwack.  SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse
  to land.

               CONCORDE
     Message for you, sir.

He falls forward revealing the arrow with the note.

               LAUNCELOT
     Concorde - speak to me.

He realises he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ...
when he notices the note.  He takes it out and reads it.

               LAUNCELOT
          (reading)
     "To whoever finds this note -
     I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry
     against my will.  Please please please please come and rescue me.
     I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."

SIR LAUNCELOT's eyes light up with holy inspiration.

               LAUNCELOT
     At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...
          (he draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE)
   Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!

               CONCORDE
     I'm not quite dead, sir ...

               LAUNCELOT
          (a little deflated)
     Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally
     wounded in vain!

               CONCORDE
     I think I could pull through, sir.

               LAUNCELOT
     Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.

He makes to leap off dramatically.

               CONCORDE
     I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.

               LAUNCELOT
     I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished
     this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.

               CONCORDE
     Really, I feel fine, sir.

               LAUNCELOT
     Farewell, Concorde!

               CONCORDE
     It just seems silly ... me lying here.

SIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest.

20 EXTERIOR - CASTLE GATEWAY - DAY

Two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram:
"H & L".

TWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on their
right spears.  We can hear from inside revelry and celebration music.

We hear LAUNCELOT's footsteps.  The TWO SENTRIES are watching him.  One of
them raises his hand.

               FIRST SENTRY
       Halt, friend ...

LAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and
hacks him to the floor.  Blood.  Swashbuckling music (perhaps).
LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming.

               SECOND SENTRY
     Hey!

He looks down at his mutilated comrade.


21 EXTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard.

in the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are arriving.
Converging on a doorway.  A country dance in progress.

SIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them.

CUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking
right and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way.

He fights his way through the country dance.  Blood.  Shrieks.  Bemused
looks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise.

Possibly Errol Flynn music.

One COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand.

Right and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his
way through the door and into the main hall.


22 INTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO interior of main hall.  Sound of busy preparations.  MEN setting
up huge hogsheads of wine.  MEN putting up last minute flower arrangements.
COOKS bearing huge trays of food, pies, suckling pigs, a swan, boar's
head, etc.

The BRIDE being dressed by several ATTENDANTS.  FATHER ordering SERVANTS
around - organizing the STEWARDS etc.

SIR LAUNCELOT bursts through the middle of them, slashing heroically,
hacking, wounding and killing.  Again fairly CLOSE-UP chaotic SHOTS.
We see GUESTS stagger back wounded - a COOK bites the dust, etc.

SIR LAUNCELOT eventually reaches the staircase ... runs up it and
into a small door.


23 INTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase.  He reaches the door
of the PRINCE's room.  he flings it open.

               FIRST GUARD
     Ah!  Now ... we're not allowed to ...

SIR LAUNCELOT runs him through,  grabs his spear and stabs the other
guard who collapses in a heap.  Hiccoughs quietly.

SIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the PRINCE,
averting his head.

               LAUNCELOT
     Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot,
     from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...
          (he looks up for the first time and his voice trails away)
      away ... I'm terribly sorry ...

               PRINCE
     You got my note!

               LAUNCELOT
     Well ... yes ...

               PRINCE
     You've come to rescue me?

               LAUNCELOT
     Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...

               PRINCE
          (his eyes light up)
     I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ...
     there must be ...

MUSIC INTRO to song.

               FATHER
          (suddenly looking in the door)
     Stop that!

Music cuts out.

FATHER sees SIR LAUNCELOT still kneeling before his son.

               FATHER
     Who are you?

               PRINCE
     I'm ... your son ...

               FATHER
     Not you.

               LAUNCELOT
          (half standing self-consciously)
     I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.

               PRINCE
     He's come to rescue me, father.

               LAUNCELOT
          (embarrassed)
     Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...

               FATHER
     Did you kill all those guards?

               LAUNCELOT
     Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...

               FATHER
     They cost fifty pounds each!

               LAUNCELOT
     Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ...
     I can explain everything ...

               PRINCE
     Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope here all
     ready ...

 He throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the room
 He  looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all ready.

               FATHER
     You killed eight wedding guests in all!

               LAUNCELOT
     Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.

               FATHER
     I can understand that.

               PRINCE
          (half out of the window)
     Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!

               FATHER
          (to his SON)
     Shut up!
          (to LAUNCELOT)
     You only killed the bride's father - that's all -

               LAUNCELOT
     Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...

               FATHER
     Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!

               LAUNCELOT
     Gosh - Is he all right?

               FATHER
     You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost
     me a fortune!

               LAUNCELOT
     I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north
     from Camelot ... when I got this note.

               FATHER
     Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?

The PRINCE's head peeps over the windowsill.

               PRINCE
     Hurry!

               LAUNCELOT
     I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.

               FATHER
     'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....

               LAUNCELOT
     Is it?

               PRINCE (out of vision)
     I am ready, Sir Launcelot.

               FATHER
     Do you want to come and have a drink?

               LAUNCELOT
     Oh ... that's awfully nice.

               PRINCE (OOV)
          (loud and shrill)
     I am ready!

As they walk past the rope, the FATHER nonchalantly cuts with his knife.
there is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from very far away
as the PRINCE makes contact with the ground.

               LAUNCELOT
     It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited
     and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...

               FATHER
     Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own
     that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?

He puts his arm round LAUNCELOT's shoulders as they go though the door.


24 INTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO the great hall.  GUESTS wounded and bloody, are tending to the dead
and injured, sighs and groans, the PRINCESS in her white wedding dress is
holding her chest and coughing blood.
People dabbing the stains off her dress.

FATHER and SIR LAUNCELOT start to walk down the grand staircase.  Talking
to each other.

One of the GUESTS notices and points to SIR LAUNCELOT.

               GUEST
     There he is!

As one man all remaining able-bodied MEN look up and make for the staircase,
muttering angrily.  SIR LAUNCELOT grabs his sword.

               FATHER
     Hold it!

But it is too lake.  SIR LAUNCELOT cannot be stopped.  With fearless abandon
he throws himself into the CROWD and starts hacking and slashing.  He has
carved quite a number up before the FATHER can stop him and pulls him back
onto the stairs.  Renewed groans and cries.


               FATHER
          (shouting above noise)
     Hold it!  Please!
               LAUNCELOT
     Sorry!  Sorry ...
          (with bitter self reproach)
     There you See ... I just got excited again and I got carried away ...
     I'm ever so sorry.
          (to the CROWD)
     Sorry.

CROWD kneeling round their wounded again.  Moans etc.

               GUEST
     He's killed the best man!

               SECOND GUEST
          (holding a limp WOMAN)
     He's killed my auntie.

               FATHER
     No, please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
     Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who ...  We
     are here today to witness the union of two young people in
     the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one
     of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.

Murmurs from CROWD;  the BRIDE smiles with relief, coughs.

     But I don't want to think I've not lost a son ...
     so much as gained a daughter ...

Smattering of applause.

     For, since the tragic death of her father ...

               SHOUT FROM BACK
     He's not quite dead!

               FATHER
     Since the fatal wounding of her father ...

               SHOUT FROM BACK
     I think He's getting better!

FATHER nods discreetly to a SOLDIER standing to one side.  The SOLDIER
slips off.  FATHER's eyes watch him move round to where the voice
came from.

               FATHER
     For ... since her own father ... who ... when he seemed about to
     recover ... suddenly felt the icy ... hand of death upon him.

A scuffle at the back.

               SHOUT FROM BACK
     Oh, he's died!

               FATHER
     I want his only daughter, from now onwards, to think of me as her
     old dad ... in a very real and legally binding sense.

Applause.

     And I'm sure sure ... that the merger ... er ... the union
     between the Princess and the brave but dangerous Sir Launcelot
     of Camelot ...

               LAUNCELOT
     What?

Gasp from the CROWD.

               CROWD
     The dead Prince!

There is CONCORDE holding "THE DEAD PRINCE" in his arms.

               CONCORDE
     He's not quite dead!

               PRINCE
     I feel much better.

               FATHER
     You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!

               PRINCE
     I was saved at the last minute.

               FATHER
     How?

               PRINCE
     Well ... I'll tell you ...

MUSIC INTRO to song.  CONCORDE stands the SON on his feet and adopts cod
"and now a number from my friend" pose.

               FATHER
     Not like that!

But the music doesn't stop and the CROWD starts to sing.

               CROWD
     He's going to tell.

               FATHER
     Shut up!

               CROWD
     He's going to tell ...

               FATHER
          (screaming)
     Shut UP!

 As the song starts the FATHER tries yelling at them and eventually gives
 up.  SIR LAUNCELOT joins CONCORDE in the CROWD.

               LAUNCELOT
       We must escape.  Quickly before the song.

               CONCORDE
       Come with me, sir.

               LAUNCELOT
       You're not right for this genre ... I must escape more dramatically.


               CONCORDE
       Quickly, sir, come this way!

               LAUNCELOT
       No!  It's not right for my idiom.  I must escape more  ... more ...

               CONCORDE
       Dramatically, sir?

               LAUNCELOT
       Dramatically.

               CROWD
     He's going to tell
     He's going to tell
     He's going to tell about his great escape.
     Oh he fell a long long way
     But he's here with us today
     What a wonderful ... escape.

CONCORDE goes.  SIR LAUNCELOT runs back up the stairs, grabs a rope
of the wall and swings out over the heads of the CROWD in a
swashbuckling manner towards a large window.  He stops just short
of the window and is left swing pathetically back and forth.

               LAUNCELOT
       Excuse me ... could somebody give me a push ...


25 EXTERIOR - A DESERTED VILLAGE - DUSK

Toothless old CRONE by the roadside.  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and two PAGES
ride up and draw up alongside the CRONE.

               ARTHUR
      Is there anywhere where we could buy a shrubbery?

The OLD CRONE crosses herself with a look of stark terror.

               CRONE
     Who sent you?

               ARTHUR
     The Knights Who Say Ni!

               CRONE
     Aaaagh!
          (she looks around in rear)
     No!  We have no shrubberies here.

               BEDEVERE
     Surely, there must be.

  ARTHUR restrains from threatening the LADY.

               ARTHUR
            (aside)
       It will be not good to argue.  These simple people are terrified
       of the Knights Who Say Ni!

               CRONE
            (she cowers)
       Ohhh!

  ARTHUR takes BEDEVERE further aside.

               ARTHUR
       There is only one way to get the information we want ...

               BEDEVERE
       Send her a letter from a long way away?

               ARTHUR
       Er, no ... no, we must ...

               BEDEVERE
       Talk to her in funny voices?

               ARTHUR
            (slightly crossly)
       No ...

               BEDEVERE
       How about trying ourselves to a tree?

               ARTHUR
            (grittily)
       No.  Our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of
       the awful Knights Who Say Ni!

               BEDEVERE
            (sagely)
       Ah!  Hit ourselves with a big rock ...

  He nods knowingly.

               ARTHUR
            (tolerantly but firmly)
       No.  Nothing we do to ourselves will frighten her as much as
       what we can do to her ...

               BEDEVERE
       Ah!

               ARTHUR
       We must threaten to say "Ni"!

               BEDEVERE
            (terror)
       Oh, no.

  They reapproach the OLD CRONE who is cowering more than ever.

               ARTHUR
     Listen, old crone!  Unless you tell us where we can buy a
     shrubbery, my friend and I will ... we will say "Ni!"

               CRONE
     Do your worst!
       I have herd the Knights say "Ni"! in the night.  I have herd the
       hideous Peng! and they have said "Nee-wum"! to my sister but still
       I have not revealed ...

               ARTHUR
     Very well, old crone.  Since you will not assist us voluntarily
     ... "Ni"!

               CRONE
     No.  Never.  No shrubberies.

               ARTHUR
     Ni!

               BEDEVERE
     Nu!

               ARTHUR
     No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!

               BEDEVERE
     Ni, ni, ni!

               ARTHUR
       It's not working.
     You're not doing it properly.  Ni!

               BEDEVERE
     Ni!

               ARTHUR
     That's it.  Ni!  Ni!

A PASSER-BY on a horse is observing them.

               ROGER
     Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?

               ARTHUR
     Erm, yes.

               ROGER
     Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni"
     at will to old ladies.  There is a pestilence upon this land!
     nothing is sacred.  Even those who arrange and design
     shrubberies are under considerable economic stress
     at this point in time.

               ARTHUR
     Did you say shrubberies?

               ROGER
     Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name
     is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

               BEDEVERE
          (rather aggressively, to ROGER)
     Ni!

               ARTHUR
     No.  No.  No!


26 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DUSK

CUT TO the glade in the forest again.

               ARTHUR
      Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?

               TALL KNIGHT
     That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly -
     But there is one small problem.

               ARTHUR
     What is that?

               TALL KNIGHT
     We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!

               ONE KNIGHT
     Ni!

               OTHERS
     Sh!

               ONE KNIGHT
          (wispers)
     Sorry.

               TALL KNIGHT
     We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

               OTHERS
     Ni!

               OTHERS
     Ni!

               ONE KNIGHT
     Peng!

               OTHERS
     Ni!

               OTHERS
     Sh!  Sh!

               TALL KNIGHT
     Therefore ... we are no longer contractually bound by any agreements
     previously entered into by the Knights Who Say Ni!

               ONE KNIGHT
     Ni!

               ANOTHER
     Peng!

               ANOTHER
     Sh!

               TALL KNIGHT
     Shut up!
          (to ARTHUR)
     Therefore, we must give you a test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who
     say Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

               OTHERS
       (terrific chorus)
     Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

               ARTHUR
     What is this test, Knights of N...
          (can't say it)
     ... Recently Knights of Ni!

               KNIGHT
     Ni!

               TALL KNIGHT
     Firstly.  You must get us another shrubbery!

               OTHER KNIGHTS
          (half seen)
     More shrubberies!  More shrubberies for the ex-Knights of Ni!

               ARTHUR
     Not another shrubbery -

               TALL KNIGHT
     When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here,
     beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a
     two-level effect with a path through the middle.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!

Chorus of "Ni!  Ni!"

               TALL KNIGHT
     When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut
     down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!

               ARTHUR
     We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!

               TALL KNIGHT
     Oh, please!

               ARTHUR
     Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!

               OTHER KNIGHTS
          (they all recoil in horror)
     Oh!

               TALL KNIGHT
     Don't say that word.

               ARTHUR
     What word?

               TALL KNIGHT
     I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words
     the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!

               ARTHUR
     How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?

               TALL KNIGHT
          (cringing in fear)
     You said it again!

               ARTHUR
     What, "is"?

               TALL KNIGHT
          (dismissively)
     No, no ... not "is"!

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     Not "is"!  Not "is"!

Suddenly singing is heard from deep in the forest.

               SIR ROBIN'S SINGERS
     Bravely good Sir Robin was not at all afraid
     To have his eyeballs skewered ...

               TALL KNIGHT
          (irritated)
     "Is" is all right ... You wouldn't get far not saying "Is"!

               BEDEVERE
     My liege, it's Sir Robin!

               TALL KNIGHT
          (covering his ears)
     You've said the word again!

SIR ROBIN and his SINGERS appear in the clearing.  The SINGERS are going on
cheerfully as usual and ROBIN walks in front of them, continually
embarrassed at their presence.

               SINGERS
     ... and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off ...

ROBIN holds his hand up for silence.

               ARTHUR
     Sir Robin!

He shakes his hand warmly.

               ROBIN
 My liege!  It's good to have found you again ...

               TALL KNIGHT
 Now he's said the word!

               ARTHUR
 Where are you going good Sir Robin?

               ROBIN'S SINGERS
          (starting up again)
     He was going home ... he was giving up,
     He was throwing in the sponge.

               ROBIN
          (to SINGERS)
     Shut up!  No ... er ... no ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I certainly
     wasn't giving up ... I was actually looking for the grail ...
     er thing ... in this forest.

               ARTHUR
     No ... it lies beyond this forest.

               TALL KNIGHT
     Stop saying the word!

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...

               ARTHUR
          (losing his patience with the fearful KNIGHTS OF "NI")
     Oh, stop it!

Terrific confusion amongst the KNIGHTS OF "NI", they roll on the ground
covering their ears.  The TALL KNIGHT remains standing trying to control
his MEN.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     They're all saying the word ...

               TALL KNIGHT
     Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...

               OTHER KNIGHTS
     You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.

ARTHUR beckons to BEDEVERE and ROBIN and they pick their way through
the helpless KNIGHTS OF "NI" and away into the forest.


27 EXTERIOR - HISTORIAN'S GLADE - DAY

We CUT TO an almost subliminal shot of the HISTORIAN'S WIFE being shown
into a police car, which then roars off out of the glade

   CUT BACK to the forest.  The Knights of "NI" are slowly recovering.  they
   get up.

               TALL KNIGHT
       Well, At least We've got ONE shrubbery.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
       Yes, Yes ... We've Done very Well ...  NI!

               TALL KNIGHT
       Ssh! I think somebody's coming.  We'll get them to give us
       another shrubbery.

               OTHER KNIGHTS
       Good Idea.  More shrubberies.  As many as possible.

   Perhaps we start to TRACK BACK from the scene as they go on talking.

               TALL KNIGHT
       What shall we call ourselves this time?

               KNIGHT
       How about "The knights of Nicky-Nicky"?


28 EXTERIOR - DAY

   A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a group formation, at the
   apparent direction of someone behind the camera.  A Few coughs
   as they shuffle together.  a moment of silence.  then they burst
   into pleasant (melliflubus) song.

   Song:   When the trees do blossom full
          and all the hills are green
          Oh! Oh! We sing
          hey! hey! We sing
          our count....ry Song...

   A hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up.  sound of raucous
   laughter OFF CAMERA.

   CUT TO Reveal a firing squad of ARCHERS kneeling not ten feet away from
   the group of SINGERS.

   Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD.  He is roaring with
   roaring with laughter.  and his court is slightly shabby - bearing all the
   marks of a faded richness.  it is a court without women, and nobody
   does the washing or shaves very well. perhaps there is washing however
   on the line over the castle.  KING BRIAN'S ADVISERS stand around
   him.   Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN
   himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the people
   at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly
   the result of some violent edict a few years back)

               KING BRIAN
       HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! HA! HA! HA! HA!
       Oh! Very good! Next!

               FIRST ADVISER
            (a Little uncomfortably - perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously
          giving him some pain)
       There are no more, Sir.

               KING BRIAN
            (grabbing him by the collar)
       What do'you mean you filthy dog!

               FIRST ADVISER
       There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom, Sir.

               KING BRIAN
       No more close harmony groups!!!

               FIRST ADVISER
       We have scoured the kingdom.

               KING BRIAN
            (lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his
          arm again slightly)
       You Miserable worm! you wretch! You Walking son of a dunghill keeper!
       Guards!

   Two Rather shabby looking GUARDS approach. (as everyone else they also
   have their left arms missing)

               FIRST ADVISER
       have mercy your MAJESTY!

               KING BRIAN
   GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest
   tree in the kingdom!

   The Guards grab him unmercifully and drag him off.  he whines piteously.


29 EXTERIOR - DAY

   CUT BACK to the glade where the KNIGHTS OF NI! were.  A police car
   roars up.  Two PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVE and a CONSTABLE get out, look
   around suspiciously, perhaps kneel and examine the ground. one POLICEMAN
   finds PATSY's shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that
   was hanging from BEDEVERE.

   They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car and drive off.


30 EXTERIOR - DAY

   Back in KING BRIAN's Court. the FIRST ADVISER has been dragged off.  there
   are muffled screams coming from the nearby tree.  the FIRST ADVISER
   is being hauled up it on pulleys.

               SECOND ADVISER
       Your Majesty, I can Find you a Lute player, whose music is passing
       sweet.

               KING BRIAN
       It's not the same, You thick-headed fool!
            (KING BRIAN hits him on the back of the head.  he falls.)
       There's no fun in killing soloists!

               SECOND ADVISER
            (picking himself up)
       He may have a friend...

               KING BRIAN
       GUARDS!

               SECOND ADVISER
       Oh Please your majesty!  Please!

               KING BRIAN
       Take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom!

   The GUARDS drag the ADVISER roughly away.

               SECOND ADVISER
       No!
            (he is dragged off screaming and protesting)

               KING BRIAN
            (roaring at the rest of the court)
       I will personally disembowel the next little bastard who tells me that
       there are no more close harmony ...

   At this moment we hear faintly the sound of singing. KING BRIAN stopped
   to listen.  The entire COURT turns thankfully towards the mellifluous
   sounds.

       We're the knights of the round table
       our shows are formidable
       but many times we're given rhymes
       that are quite unsingable...

               KING BRIAN
       Wait a minute! Five point harmony with a counter-tenor lead!

   Various members of the COURT sigh and breathe more easily.

               CREEP
       Thank goodness.

               KING BRIAN
       Shut up!
            (punches him right on the end of the nose and shouts to the
          SECOND ADVISER)
       Oy you!

               SECOND ADVISER
            (doubled-up, Surrounded by soldiers busy with his stomach)
       Yes, Your majesty?

               KING BRIAN
       Go and get 'em!

               SECOND ADVISER
            (gratefully)
     Thank you sir!
            (He staggers off with some difficulty)

               GUARD
       'ere... We'd just started taking his kidneys out.

   CUT TO ARTHUR,BEDEVERE,GALAHAD and LANCELOT.  (Garwin,thrstam, Hecrot)
   plus all their pages.  there are riding along singing cheerily.

               KNIGHTS
       We're baby mad and Camelot
       we nurse and push the pram a lot
       in war we're tough and able
       quite indefatigable
       between our quests we sequin vests
       and dress like betty gable
       it's a...

               SECOND ADVISER
       HALT!

               SIR GALAHAD
       Who are you who dares to halt the knights of king Arthur's round table
       in mid-verse?

               SECOND ADVISER
       I bring greetings from the court of king Brian.

               SIR LANCELOT
       King Brian the wild?

               SECOND ADVISER
       Some call him that, but he's calmed down allot recently.

               SIR GALAHAD
       Are those YOUR kidneys?

               SECOND ADVISER
            (covering his stomach)
       No no... It's nothing - just a flesh wound.
            (The KNIGHTS look at each other)
       he has herd your beautiful melody; and wishes you to come to his court,
       that he may listen at his ease ooh!

               SIR LANCELOT
       You must be joking!
            (general murmur or agreement from the other KNIGHTS.)
       Go to the court of king Brian the wild and sing close harmony!

               OTHER KNIGHTS
       No fear etc.

               SECOND ADVISER
            (in increasing pain)
       It need not be close harmony oooh agh!

               SIR GALAHAD
       Ah but it would get round to close harmony, wouldn't it?

               SECOND ADVISER
       Not necessarily ... As I say king Brian is much more relaxed than
       he used to be.

               SIR GALAHAD
       I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of
       straight choral work?

               SECOND ADVISER
       Well obviously he'd prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!

               KNIGHTS
       Ah! There you are!

               SIR LAUNCELOT
       We'd end un-like the Shalott Choral Society.

               SECOND ADVISER
       Oh that was an accident - honestly he's so calm now oh!

               ARTHUR
       No we must be on our way.

   They start off.

               SECOND ADVISER
            (by now lying on the ground at his last gasp but still trying to
          sound threatening)
       If you don't come and sing for him ... ah ... he'll drive ... oh
       ... iron spikes though your heads.

               KNIGHTS
       Ah! That sounds more like Brian the wild!

               SECOND ADVISER
            (looking helplessly at his intestines)
       He ... he ... still gets irritable occasionally.

               SIR GALAHAD
       Like with close harmony groups.

               SECOND ADVISER
       Ooh ... Look if you're scared ...

               SIR LANCELOT
       We're not SCARED!

               SECOND ADVISER
            (With his last ounce of strength)
       Very well! King Brian challenges your to sing before him in close
       harmony!

               ARTHUR
       A challenge?

   The KNIGHTS look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow
   suffuses KING ARTHUR's eyes as he looks heaven-wards. The other KNIGHTS
   look at him rather fearfully.

               ARTHUR
            (majestacally)
       It is a challenge.  We cannot refuse.

               SIR GALAHAD
       King Brian's a fucking looney.

               SECOND ADVISER
       Great!
            (dies)

               SIR GALAHAD
       Are you all right?

   CUT TO KING BRIAN the wild on his dias.  he sees the KNIGHTS enter
   the arena.

               KING BRIAN
       Ah good!

   CUT TO TRUMPETERS who executes a rather bad fanfare full of missed
   notes.  meanwhile various SHOTS of preparation.

   KING BRIAN settling down.

   KNIGHTS being led up to the podium. the last of the previous close harmony
   group is being loaded onto a cart and pushed away by the cart driver
   from scene tow (Perhaps we see him being paid off)

   SHOT of KING BRIAN on his podium and the HERALD being untied and having
   his gag removed.

   SHOT of ARTHUR and KNIGHTS getting into a group on the podium still
   rather nervous.

   The fanfare comes to an end, and several wrong notes.

               KING BRIAN
            (who can't wait)
       RIGHT! Carry on gentleman.

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN SAYS CARRY ON!

               ARTHUR
            (wispering)
       All right ... two tenor lines - I'll take the base.

   They all nod.

       One... Two... Three...

   Sound of Bows being drown very near by.

   ARTHUR looks up and frowns.

   CUT to reveal a line of twenty ARCHERS they all have their left leg
   missing, but they DO have two arms.

   Their arrows are drawn back and point directly at ARTHUR & CO.

               ARTHUR
       Hold it! Err ... King Brian!

               HERALD
            (Louder than ever)
       ARTHUR OF CAMELOT ADDRESSES THEE OH MIGHTY KING BRIAN!

               KING BRIAN
          (trueulently)
       What?

               ARTHUR
       What are THEY For?
            (Indicates the archers)

               KING BRIAN
       Them? they're... just to show you where the audience would be.

               ARTHUR
       Well we'd prefer to do it without an audience.

               KING BRIAN
       Oh you've GOT to have an AUDIENCE!

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN THE WISE AND GOOD RULER OF THIS LAND SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO
       HAVE AN AUDIENCE!

               ARTHUR
       We'd rather give a private recital.

               HERALD
       THEY SAY THEY'D RATHER GIVE A PRIVATE RECITAL! O WISE GOOD AND JUST
       KING BRIAN AND NOT THE LEAST BIT WILD!

               KING BRIAN
            (to himself)
       Turds...

   HE nods to the ARCHERS who turn and hop smartly off in step.

               ONE-LEGGED RSM
       Left ... Left ... Left, left, left, left
       Left ... Left ... Left, left, left, left.

   They hop round behind a long fence and disappear from sight
   (Fence needs to be about 7 or 9 feet high)

               KING BRIAN
       Right! Ready when you are.

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN IS READY!

               ARTHUR
       And ... One ... Two ... Three ... Four ...

   They are just about to sing when the ARCHERS, bows read and arrows points,
   peep over the top of the fence.

       HOLD IT!

               SIR GAWAIN
            (singing)
       We're

   Quick flash of ARCHERS sensed to fire, one tires to hold his shot back but
   fails and fires his arrows by accident in the air.

   Quick flash of FIRST ADVISER who is hanging by his nostrils from the
   highest tree in the kingdom, moaning, getting hit by the arrow.

               KING BRIAN
       What is it now?

               ARTHUR
       We're not entirely happy with the acoustics.

               HERALD
       THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH...

               KING BRIAN
            (impatiently)
       Oh Sod the acoustics!  Get on with the singing!

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN SAYS SOD THE ACOUSTICS!

               ARTHUR
       In that case we shall just have to perform elsewhere.
            (turns to his knights and begins to usher them off)

               HERALD
       THEY SAY IN THAT CASE THEY SHALL HAVE TO PERFORM ELSEWHERE, O RICH,
       FAMOUS AND EXTREMELY CALM KING!

               KING BRIAN
            (getting very angry and dribbling slightly)
       NO! you've GOT to sing on the target are - er - convert ... er ...
       thing ...

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN HAS STUMBLED OVER HIS WORDS! WHAT A WONDERFULLY HUMAN
       INCIDENT.

               KING BRIAN
       Don't editorialize!

               HERALD
       SORRY, KING.

               KING BRIAN
       Come on you bastards! Sing close harmony!

   KING BRIAN snaps his finders and the ARCHERS rise above the fence without
   any pretence it concealment - fitting arrows into their bows.

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN CALLS THEM BASTARDS AND DEMANDS TO HEAD CLOSE HARMONY!
       WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?

               KING BRIAN
       I said don't.

               HERALD
       Sorry, King.

               KING BRIAN
       Right! On the count of three ... one ...

               HERALD
       THE KING'S SAID ONE!

               KING BRIAN
       Two!

               HERALD
       THE KING'S SAID TWO! THEY'VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT!

   We hear the sound of bows being drawn back.  Tension mounts.  the KNIGHTS
   all look pretty grim.  The end is clearly pretty near.

               KING BRIAN
            (face in a paroxysm of blood-lust)
       Three!

               HERALD
       THREE!

   Sound in the distance of beautiful close harmony singing

       "Bravely, good sir robin was not at all afraid..."

   CUT TO see SIR ROBIN and his MINSTRELS approaching from round a corner
   of the castle. SIR ROBIN walks a few feet in from of the them looking
   rather embarrassed.

               KING BRIAN
            (turning to the sound)
       FANTASTIC!

   CUT BACK TO ROBIN'S MINSTRELS

       "To have his eyeballs skewered and his kidneys ... argh!"

   They are suddenly pin-cushioned with arrows.

               KING BRIAN
       HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO!
       Oh bloody marvellous!

   ROBIN turns and looks at the decimated remains of his MINSTRELS, surprised
   but relieved.

               ARTHUR
       Sir Robin! this way!

   ARTHUR leads is MEN off the platform and they are joined by their PAGES and
   make good their escape.

               KING BRIAN
       HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO!

               HERALD
       KING BRIAN'S SHOT THE WRONG GROUP!

               KING BRIAN
       Shut up!

   HE swings his sword and slices the HERALD'S head off.

               HERALD'S HEAD
            (as it rolls away)
       PRESS FREEDOM INFRINGED!


28 EXTERIOR - BEYOND FOREST - DAY - ANIMATION

Shots of ARTHUR etc.  Riding out of the forest.  They leave the forest and
they meet LAUNCELOT and GALAHAD.

               VOICE OVER
     And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to
     find the Enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.
     Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much
     rejoicing.


29 EXTERIOR - ANOTHER LANDSCAPE - DAY - ANIMATION

               VOICE OVER
     In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's
     minstrels ...  And there was much rejoicing ... A year passed ...

MONTAGE of shots of the KNIGHTS.

     Autumn changed into Winter ... Winter changed into Spring ...  Spring
     changed back into Autumn and Autumn gave Winter and Spring a miss and
     went straight on into Summer ...  Until one day ...


30 EXTERIOR - WASTES - DAY

The KNIGHTS are riding along the top of a ridge.  The country is wild and
inhospitable.  Suddenly some of them see fire in the distance and ride
towards it.  As they approach they see an impressive WIZARD figure striding
around conjuring up fire from the ground and causing various bushes and
branches to burst into flame.

               ARTHUR
     What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint
     or tinder?

               TIM
     I am an enchanter.

ARTHUR looks at BEDEVERE.

               ARTHUR
     By what name are you known?

               TIM
     There are some who call me Tim?

               ARTHUR
     Greetings Tim the Enchanter!

               TIM
     Greetings King Arthur.

               ARTHUR
     You know my name?

               TIM
     I do.
          (does another fire trick)
     You seek the Holy Grail.

               ARTHUR
     That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.

               TIM
          (does another fire trick)
     Quite.

Ripple of applause from the KNIGHTS.

               ARTHUR
     Yes we seek the Holy Grail.
          (clears throat very quietly)
     Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.

               ONE OR TWO KNIGHTS
     Yes it is.

               ARTHUR
     And so we're looking for it.

               KNIGHTS
     Yes, we are.

               BEDEVERE
     We have been for some time.

               KNIGHTS
     Yes.

               ROBIN
     Months.

               ARTHUR
     Yes ... and obviously any help we get is ... is very ... helpful.

               GALAHAD
     Do you know where it ...

TIM does another fire trick.

               ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
     Sssssh!

               ARTHUR
     Fine ... well er ... we mustn't take up anymore of your time ...
     I don't suppose ... sorry to sort of keep on about it ... you
     haven't by any chance ... aaah ... any idea where one might
     find ... a ... aaa ...

               TIM
     What?

               ARTHUR
     A G...g...g...

               TIM
     A Grail?

They all jump slightly and look about apprehensively.

               ARTHUR
     Er ... yes ... I think so.

               ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
     Yes.

               TIM
     Yes.

               KNIGHTS
     Fine.

               ROBIN
     Splendid!

               OTHERS
     Yes, marvellous.

TIM looks thoughtful and they all stand around a little.  Then TIM produces
another fire trick producing several different colours.

               ARTHUR
     Look, you're a busy man ...

               TIM
     Yes, I can help you with your guest.

Slight pause.

               ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
     Thank you.  Yes, thank you very much.

               TIM
     To the north there lies a cave,  the cave of Caerbannog,
     wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock,
     the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged ...

There is a thunderclap and a wind starts.  They KNIGHTS get nervous.

               TIM
      ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.

               ARTHUR
     How shall we find this cave, O Tim?

               TIM
     Follow!

The KNIGHTS register delight and wheel round on themselves.

     But follow only if you are men of valour.  For the entrance
     to this cave is guarded by a monster, a creature so foul
     and cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived.
     Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair ...
     therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or courage
     come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty pointy teeth.

               ARTHUR
       What an eccentric performance!


31 EXTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO impressive rock face with caves in it.  The KNIGHTS are 'riding'
towards it.  A foreboding atmosphere supervenes.  TIM gives a signal for
quietness.  ARTHUR shushes the 'horses'.

               ARTHUR
     Shhh!

The PAGES decrease the amount of noise they are making with the coconuts
for a few seconds.  Then there is a burst of noise from them including
whinnying.

               BEDEVERE
          (to ARTHUR)
     They're nervous, sire.

               ARTHUR
     Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.

TIM takes a strange look at them.  They walk on leaving the PAGES behind.
After a few more strides TIM halts them with a sign.

               TIM
     Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

CUT TO shot of cave.  Bones littered around.  The KNIGHTS get the wind
up partially.  A little dry ice, glowing green can be seen at the
entrance.  Suddenly we become aware of total silence.  Any noises the
KNIGHTS make sound very exaggerated.  They unsheathe their swords.

               ARTHUR
     Keep me covered.

Stir among KNIGHTS.

               BEDEVERE
     What with?

               ARTHUR
     Just keep me covered.

               TIM
     Too late.

               ARTHUR
     What?

               TIM
     There he is!

They all turn,, and see a large white RABBIT lollop a few yards out of the
cave.  Accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster noise.

               ARTHUR
     Where?

               TIM
     There.

               ARTHUR
     Behind the rabbit?

               TIM
     It is the rabbit.

               ARTHUR
     ... You silly sod.

               TIM
     What?

               ARTHUR
     You got us all worked up.

               BEDEVERE
     You cretin!

               TIM
     That is not an ordinary rabbit ... 'tis the most foul cruel
     and bad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.

               ROBIN
     You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!

               TIM
     That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!

               GALAHAD
       Oh, fuck off.
       Get stuffed.

               TIM
     He'll do you up a treat mate!

               GALAHAD
     Oh yeah?

               ROBIN
       You turd!
       Mangy scots git!

               TIM
     Look.  I'm warning you.

               ROBIN
     What's he do?  Nibble your bum?

               TIM
     Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a...
     look at the bones.

               ARTHUR
     Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

               BORS
     Right.  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew coming up.

               TIM
     Look!

As TIM points they all spin round to see the RABBIT leap at BORS'
throat with an appalling scream.  From a distance of about twenty feet
there is a tin opening noise, a cry from BORS.  A quick CLOSE-UP
of a savage RABBIT biting through tin and BORS' head flies off.  The
RABBIT leaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking
in the KNIGHTS' direction and growling menacingly.

               ARTHUR
     Je...sus Christ!

               TIM
     I warned you!

               ROBIN
     I done it again.

               TIM
     Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better
     didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you
     called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.

               ARTHUR
     Oh, shut up.

               TIM
          (quietly)
     It's always the same ... if I've said it once.

               ARTHUR
     Charge!

They all charge with swords drawn towards the RABBIT.  A tremendous twenty
second fight with Peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also on the
Kung Fu and karate-type films ensues, in which some four KNIGHTS are
comprehensively killed.

     Run away!  Run away!

               ALL KNIGHTS
          (taking up cry)
     Run away!  Run away!

They run down from the cave and hide, regrouping behind some rocks.  TIM,
some way away, is pointing at them and laughing derisively.

               TIM
     Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.

               ARTHUR
     Who did we lose?

               LAUNCELOT
     Sir Gawain.

               GALAHAD
     Ector.

               ARTHUR
     And Bors.  Five.

               GALAHAD
       Three, sir!

               ARTHUR
     Three.  Well, we'll not risk another frontal
     assault.  That rabbit's dynamite.

               ROBIN
     Would it help to confuse him if we ran away more.

               ARTHUR
     Shut up.  Go and change your armour.

ROBIN leaves, walking strangely.

               GALAHAD
     Let us taunt it.  It may become so cross that it will make
     a mistake.

               ARTHUR
     Like what?

GALAHAD cannot find a suitable answer to this.

               GALAHAD
     Do we have any bows?

               ARTHUR
     No.

               LAUNCELOT
     We have the Holy Hand Grenade.

               ROBIN
     The what?

               ARTHUR
     The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.  'Tis one of the sacred
     relics Brother Maynard always carries with him.

               ALL
     Yes. Of course.

               ARTHUR
          (shouting)
     Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!

Slight pause.  Then from the area where the 'HORSES' are, a small group
of MONKS process forward towards the KNIGHTS, the leading MONK bearing
and ornate golden reliquary, and the accompanying MONKS chanting and
waving incense.  They reach the KNIGHTS.  The hand grenade is suffused
with the holy glow.

ARTHUR takes it.  Pause

               ARTHUR
     How does it ... er ...

               LAUNCELOT
     I know not.

               ARTHUR
     Consult the Book of Armaments.

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     Armaments Chapter Two Verses Nine to Twenty One.

               ANOTHER MONK
          (reading from bible)
     And St.  Attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying
     "O Lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow
     thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. "and the Lord did grin and
     people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies
     and orang-utans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and...

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     Skip a bit brother ...

               ANOTHER MONK
     ... Er ... oh, yes ... and the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou
     take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more,
     no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the
     number of the counting shalt be three.  Four shalt thou not count,
     neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.
     Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number,
     be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
     towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.

               ARTHUR
     Right.

He pulls Pin out.  The MONK blesses the grenade as ...

               ARTHUR
     (quietly)
     One, two
       , three ...
       , five ...

               GALAHAD
       Three, sir!

               ARTHUR
       Three.

ARTHUR throws the grenade at the RABBIT.  There is an explosion and cheering
from the KNIGHTS.

               ALL KNIGHTS
     Praise be to the lord.  Huzzah!

32 INTERIOR - CAVE - DAY

MIX THROUGH TO the KNIGHTS entering the cave.  It is a large cave and as
they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave
a fearsome looking CREATURE which watches them with some surprise
as they walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall.
The KNIGHTS are accompanied by BROTHER MAYNARD.

               ARTHUR
     There!  Look!

               BEDEVERE
     What does it say?

               GALAHAD
     What language is this?

               BEDEVERE
     Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     It is Aramaic!

               GALAHAD
     Of course.  Joseph of Aramathea!

               ALL
     Of course.

               ARTHUR
     What does it say?

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     It reads ... "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of
     Aramathea."

Excitement.

     "He who is valorous and pure of heart may find the Holy Grail
      in the aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."

               ARTHUR
     What?

               BROTHER MAYNARD
      "The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."

               BEDEVERE
     What's that?

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     He must have died while carving it.

               BEDEVERE
     Oh, come on.

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     That's what it says.

               ARTHUR
          (miming)
     But if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
     He'd just say it.

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     It's down there carved in stone.

               GALAHAD
     Perhaps he was dictating.

               ARTHUR
     Shut up.  Is that all it says?

               BROTHER MAYNARD
     That's all.  "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".

               ARTHUR
     "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".

               BEDEVERE
     Do you think he meant the Camargue?

               GALAHAD
     Where's that?

               BEDEVERE
     France, I think.

               LAUNCELOT
     Isn't there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh's in Cornwall?

               ARTHUR
     No, that's Saint Ives.

A muffled roar is heard.

               ROBIN
       Hey!

               BEDEVERE
       No, that's in Herefordshire.

               ROBIN
            (more urgently)
       No ... HEY!!!

               LAUNCELOT
       "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... "

               ROBIN
       No!  "Hey"! is surprise and alarm!

               BEDEVERE
       Oooooh!

               LAUNCELOT
       No "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... " at the back of the throat.

               BEDEVERE
       No!  "Oooooh!" in surprise and alarm!

He indicated the entrance of the cave.  They all turn and look.  There in
the opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon beast.

               ARTHUR
     Oh!
               GALAHAD
     My God!

               LAUNCELOT
     What is it?

               BEDEVERE
     I know!  I know!  I Know!

               ARTHUR
     What?

               BEDEVERE
     It's the ... oh ...
          (snaps his fingers as he tries to remember)
     it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

Another hideous roar.

     That's it!

               ARTHUR
     What?

               BEDEVERE
     It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns.

               ARTHUR
       Who was that?

               HECTOR
            (from back of group; northern and helpful)
       It was Sir Alf.

               ARTHUR
       I didn't know we had a Sir Alf.

               HECTOR
       He was feeding it bread.

               ARTHUR
            (shouting back)
       Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand
       well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

               HECTOR
       Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

               ROBIN
       Look out.

  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.  The KNIGHTS retreat
  into the darkness of the cave.

               GAWAIN
            (as they run)
       It's only a cartoon.

               ARTHUR
       Sh!

They run off.  Darkness.  The MONSTER lumbering through on animation.

               VOICE OVER
       As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur
      and his knights seemed hopeless,  when, suddenly ... the animator
      suffered a fatal heart attack.

               ANIMATOR
       Aaaaagh!

               VOICE OVER
       The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail
       could continue.

ANIMATED SEQUENCE.  Leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a
distant opening to the cave.  They reach the opening.  It is day.


33 EXTERIOR - DAY

The KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a
breathtaking, barren landscape.  Glencoe.  They are half they way up
the side of a mountain.  They rest a few seconds and get their breath
back.

               GALAHAD
      Look!

               GALAHAD
      There it is!

               ARTHUR
      The Bridge of Death!

               ROBIN
            (to himself)
       Oh! Great ...

   They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone
   which bears the words:  "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!  5 miles" and an arrow.

               ARTHUR
       God be praised.  This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke
       in scene twenty-four.

   The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along
   the side of the mountain.  GALAHAD is leading.

   MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher.  The path gets more and more
   slippery and dangerous.  They reach another milestone which says:
   "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!  4 miles" and an arrow, and "Ni!  82 miles" and
   an arrow pointing in the opposite direction.  They go on.  It is
   dangerous and difficult.  Tension in their faces.

   As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR.

               BEDEVERE
       We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...

               ROBIN
            (to himself)
       Oh, great!

               BEDEVERE
       The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveller
       three questions.  And he who answers the three questions can
       cross in safety.

               ROBIN
            (warily)
       And if you get a question wrong?

               BEDEVERE
       You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

34 EXTERIOR - DAY

   CUT TO them struggling along.  Perhaps downhill now.  It is growing misty.
   SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points.  They peer.

   CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the
   gorge below.  We cannot see the other side.

   Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they
   met earlier in the forest.

               ARTHUR
            (to BEDEVERE)
       He's the Keeper of the Bridge.  It's the old man.

               BEDEVERE
            (swallowing hard)
       Who's going to answer the questions?

               ARTHUR
       You go, Robin, and God be with you.

               ROBIN
            (looking round wildly)
       Er ... I tell you what -
            (lowering voice)
       Why doesn't Launcelot go?

               ARTHUR
            (considering a moment)
       Very well ... Sir Launcelot.  Brave Sir Launcelot.  This is the Bridge
       of Death ...

               LAUNCELOT
       Oh, yes sir ... I will take it single-handed.
            (drawing his sword)
       I will ...

   ARTHUR restrains him.

               ARTHUR
       No, hang on.  All we want is for you to approach the old man
       and he will ask you three questions.  Answer those question as
       best you can, and we will watch ... and pray.

               LAUNCELOT
       Yes, my liege ...

               ARTHUR
       Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot!  Be careful ...

   They shake hands, Arthur's eyes moisten.  LAUNCELOT approaches the
   Bridge of Death.

               ARTHUR
       Listen to the questions.

               BEDEVERE
       Look!  It's the old man from scene 24 - what's he Doing here?

               ARTHUR
       He is the keeper of the Bridge.  He asks each traveler five questions ...
               GALAHAD
       Three questions.

               ARTHUR
       Three questions ... he who answers the five questions

               GALAHAD
       Three questions.

               ARTHUR
       Three questions, may cross in safety.

               ROBIN
            (warily)
       And if you get a question wrong?

               ARTHUR
       You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

               ROBIN
       Oh ... wacho!

               GALAHAD
       Who's going to answer the questions?

               ARTHUR
       Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin you go.

               ROBIN
       Hey! I've got a great idea!
       Why doesn't Launcelot go?

               LAUNCELOT
       Yes. Let me.  I will take it single-handed ...
       I will make feint to the north-east ...

               ARTHUR
       No, hang on!  Just answer the five questions ...

               GALAHAD
       Three questions ...

               ARTHUR
       Three questions ...  And we shall watch ... and pray.

               LAUNCELOT
       I understand, my liege.

               ARTHUR
       Good luck,  brave Sir Launcelot ...  God be with you.

   LAUNCELOT APPROACHES THE BRIDGEKEEPER.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     Stop!

SIR LAUNCELOT stops.  The KNIGHTS watch anxiously.  ARTHUR sniffs briefly
and glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN's lower armour.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     Who approaches the Bridge of Death
     Must answer me
     These questions three!
     Ere the other side he see.

               LAUNCELOT
     Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is your name?

               LAUNCELOT
     My name is Sir Launcelot.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is your quest?

               LAUNCELOT
     To find the Holy Grail.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is your favorite colour?

               LAUNCELOT
     Blue.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     Right.  Off you go.

SIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist.  The bridge perhaps disappears
into the mist and we cannot see the other side.  ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN
exchange glances.  ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief.

               ROBIN
     That's easy!

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     Stop!
     Who approacheth the Bridge of Death
     Must answer me
     These questions three!
     Ere the other side he see!

               ROBIN
     Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is your name?

               ROBIN
     My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is your quest?

               ROBIN
     To seek the Grail!

               BRIDGEKEEPER
     What is the capital of Assyria?

               ROBIN
          (indignantly)
     I don't know that!

He is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the
precipice.

               ROBIN
     Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!


35 EXTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side.  He looks
back across the invisible chasm.  Dimly in the distance he hears:

               GAWAIN  (OUT OF VISION)
     Sir Gawain of Camelot!

               BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)
     What is your quest?

               GAWAIN (OOV)
     To seek the Holy Grail.

               BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)
       What goes:  black white ... black white ... black white?

               GAWAIN (OOV)
       Oh, er ... Babylon!  er ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

   SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge.  In the
   distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud,
   suddenly a hand lands on LAUNCELOT's shoulder.

               POLICEMAN (VOICE OVER)
       Just want to ask you some questions, sir.

     LAUNCELOT turns and reacts.  He is led away.


36 EXTERIOR - LAKE - DAY

   CUT TO ARTHUR, GALAHAD and BEDEVERE struggling towards the lake.

               BEDEVERE
            (to ARTHUR)
       How did you know how many wing-beats a swallow needs to
       maintain velocity?

               ARTHUR
       Oh ... when you're king you know all those things.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       What is your favorite colour?

               GAWAIN
       Blue ...  No yelloooooww!

   ARTHUR and BEDEVERE step forward.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       What is your name?

               ARTHUR
       It is Arthur, King of the Britons.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       What is your quest?

               ARTHUR
       To seek the Holy Grail.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

               ARTHUR
       What do you mean?  An African or European swallow?

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       Er ...  I don't know that ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

   BRIDGEKEEPER is cast into the gorge.

               BEDEVERE
       How do you know so much about swollows?

               ARTHUR
       Well you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.

Suddenly they appear at water's edge.  They look across the water.  A huge
expanse disappearing into the mist.  How can they cross?

Suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist
appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them.

They gaze in wonder.  The mysterious boat comes to where they are standing.
As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer
   to the boat.  As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks
   up at them.

               BOATKEEPER
            (he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)
       He who would cross the Sea if Fate
       must answer me
       these questions twenty-eight.

   He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances,
   then turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the
   water.  They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist

   FADE OUT


37 ANIMATION

   A wondrous journey in animation carries them across the lake.

   MIX TO


38 EXTERIOR - DAY

The boat carries them across a magical lake.  They land and get out of
the boat, their faces suffused with heavenly radiance, and fall to their
knees.

Crescendo on music.

               ARTHUR
     God be praised!  The deaths of many find knights have this day
     been avenged.

Music swells.  They bend their heads in prayer, before the castle for
which they have searched for so long.  Suddenly a voice comes from
the battlements.

Music cuts dead.

               FROG
     Ha ha!  Hello!  Smelly English K...niggets ... and Monsieur Arthur
     King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.

The KNIGHTS look up.

               FROG
     We French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English
     mousedropping hoarders ... how you say:  "Begorrah!"

ARTHUR stands and shouts.

               ARTHUR
     How dare you profane this place with your presence!  I command
     you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, open the door to the
     Sacred Castle, to which God himself has guided us!
          (he turns to the KNIGHTS)
     Come.

ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS advance towards the castle.

               FROG
     How you English say:  I one more time, mac, I unclog my nose towards you,
     sons of a window-dresser,  so, you think you could out-clever us French
     fellows with your silly knees-bent creeping about advancing
     behaviour.
          (blows a raspberry)
     I wave my private parts at your aunties, you brightly-coloured,
     mealy-templed, cranberry-smelling, electric donkey-bottom biters.

By this time ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and GALAHAD have reached the door.
ARTHUR bangs on the door.

               ARTHUR
     In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred
     castle.

Jeering from the battlements.

               FROG
     No chance, English bed-wetting types.  We burst our pimples at you,
     and call your door-opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained
     wipers of other people's bottoms!

French laughter

               ARTHUR
     If you do not open these doors, we will take this castle by force ...

A bucket of slops land on ARTHUR.  He tries to retain his dignity.

               ARTHUR
     In the name of God ... and the glory of our ...

Another bucket of what can only be described as human ordure hits ARTHUR.

     ... Right!
          (to the KNIGHTS)
     That settles it!

They turn and walk away.  French jeering follows them.

               FROG
     Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or
     we fire arrows into the tops of your heads and make castanets
     of your testicles already.

               ARTHUR
          (to KNIGHTS)
     Walk away.  Just ignore them.

ARTHUR, BEDEVERE and GALAHAD walk off.  A small hail of chickens,
watercress,   badgers and mattresses follows them.  But they are on their
dignity as they try to talk nonchalantly as they walk away into the trees.

               FROG
     And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!  And, if you think
     you got a nasty time this taunting, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy
     k...niggets, and A. King Esquire.

  CUT BACK TO the drenched BRIDGEKEEPER/SOOTHSAYER beside the lake He
  rises up into SHOT.

               BRIDGEKEEPER
       He would cross the sea of fate,
       Must answer me these questions
       Twenty-eight.

  CUT TO see he is talking to two PLAIN-CLOTHES POLICEMEN and two
  CONSTABLES.

               INSPECTOR
       All right, put him in the van.

  THE BRIDGEKEEPER is led away and put into a police van.

CUT BACK TO ARTHUR still walking away.  French taunts still audible in
the distance.

               FRENCH
     You couldn't catch clap in a brothel, silly English K...niggets ...

               ARTHUR
          (to BEDEVERE)
     We shall attack at once.

               BEDEVERE
     Yes, my liege.
          (he turns)
     Stand by for attack!!

CUT TO enormous army forming up.  Trebuchets, rows of PIKEMEN, siege
towers, pennants flying, shouts of "Stand by for attack!"  Traditional
army build-up shots.  The shouts echo across the ranks of the army.
We see various groups reacting, and stirring themselves in readiness.

               ARTHUR
     Who are they?

               BEDEVERE
     Oh, just some friends!

We end up back with ARTHUR.  He seems satisfied that the ARMY is ready.

PANNING down the serried ranks, pikes ready, pennants flapping in the
wind.  Some of the horses whinny nervously,  and rattle their coconuts.

ARTHUR is satisfied at last.  He addresses the castle.

               ARTHUR
     French persons!  Today the blood of many valiant knights shall
     bee avenged.  In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight
     until each one of you lies dead and the Grail returns to those
     whom God has chosen.

ARTHUR lowers his visor, turns to have a last look at ARMY, then:

     CHARGE!

The mighty ARMY charges.  Thundering noise of feet.  Clatter of coconuts.
Shouts etc.

The charge towards the castle.

Suddenly there is a wail of a siren and a couple of police cars roar
round in front of the charging ARMY and the POLICE leap out and stop
them.  TWO POLICEMAN and the HISTORIAN'S WIFE.  Black Marias skid up
behind them.

The ARMY halts.
               HISTORIAN'S WIFE
     They're the ones, I'm sure.

               INSPECTOR END OF FILM
     Grab 'em!

The POLICE grab ARTHUR and bundle him into the maria.

SIR BEDEVERE is led off with a blanket over his head.  They are bundled
into the black maria and the van drives off.

The rest of the ARMY stand around looking at a loss.

               INSPECTOR END OF FILM
          (picks up megaphone)
     All right!  Clear off!  Go on!

A few reaction shots of the ARMY not quite sure what to do.

               INSPECTOR END OF FILM
     Move along.  There's nothing to see!  Keep moving!

Suddenly he notices the cameras.

As the black maria drives away QUICK SHOT through window of all the
KNIGHTS huddled inside.

               INSPECTOR END OF FILM
          (to Camera)
     All right, put that away sonny.

He walks over to it and puts his hand over the lens.

The film runs out through the gate and the projector shines on the
screen.

There is a blank screen for some fifteen seconds.

  Suddenly jazzy music.  Animated titles.  (A new film completely free
  with the Monty Python film.)


                              "THE CREDITS"

  Four of five minute film (mainly animated) about the credits, i.e it
  includes the actual credits for the film but is really elaborate.


               THE END


  Slushy organ music starts and the houselights in the cinema come on ...
  organ music continues as the audience leave.

Dear Mike,

The Censor's representative, Tony Kerpel, came along to Friday's
screening at Twinkenham and he gave up his opinion of the film's
probale certificate.

He thinks the film will be AA, but it would be possible, given
some dialogue cuts, to make the film an A rating, which would
increase the audience.  (AA is 14 and over, and A is 5-14).

For an 'A' we would have to:

          Lose as may shits as possible

          Take Jesus Christ out, if possible

          Loose "I fart in your general direction"

          Lose "the oral sex"

          Lose "oh, fuck off"

          Lose "We make castanets out of your testicles"

I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the
shits, take the odd Jesus Christ out and lose Oh fuck off, but
to retain 'fart in your general direction', 'castanets of your
testicles' and 'oral sex' and ask him for an 'A' rating on
that basis.

Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.

Yours sincerely,

Mark Forstater.
