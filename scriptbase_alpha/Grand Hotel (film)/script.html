<b>                                       GRAND HOTEL
</b>


                                        Written by

                                       Bela Balazs



                          Based on the play "Menschen im Hotel"

                                      By Vicki Baum



                                     American version

                                   By William A. Drake

<b>                                                               SHOOTING DRAFT
</b>
<b>                
</b>
<b>                                         PROLOGUE
</b>
               Berlin.

               Season is March.

               Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.

               Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.

               Time: The Present.

<b>                
</b>
<b>               EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR
</b>
               Show general natural action of people going in and people 
               coming out but in it is the definite inference of people 
               arriving and people leaving the big hotel.

               MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA 
               PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and 
               hearing.

<b>               DISSOLVE OUT.
</b>
               DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and 
               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business 
               jumble.

               CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the 
               steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it 
               passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.

               THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement 
               across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA 
               now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. 
               Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE 
               PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.

               At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who 
               emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish 
               who she is.

               THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear 
               her saying to Senf:

<b>                                     SUZETTE
</b>                         Madam Grusinskaya will not want her 
                         car.

               This line is only just above the general clatter of action 
               but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- 
               and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going 
               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, 
               saying:

<b>                                     VOICE
</b>                         Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a 
               section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in 
               profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of 
               people drinking before their lunch.

               We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, 
               looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, 
               is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at 
               the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his 
               face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to 
               her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a 
               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at 
               his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA 
               and he moves out towards the lobby.

               BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the 
               main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of 
               waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A 
               string orchestra is playing.

               Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous 
               Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important 
               to a table.

               THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just 
               as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel 
               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:

<b>                                     MAITRE D'HOTEL
</b>                         Where is that gentleman's soup?

               The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to 
               argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to 
               another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:

<b>                                     WAITER
</b>                         Where's that soup?

               Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, 
               into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's 
               counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that 
               moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket 
               forward.

<b>                                     BOY
</b>                         Quick -- come on -- come on...

               The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception 
               of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll 
               slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over 
               a cauldron of soup.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
               CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small 
               cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and 
               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- 
               She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has 
               filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down 
               the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.

               THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. 
               Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette 
               carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A 
               horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, 
               he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to 
               tear the place down.

<b>                                     WAITER
</b>                              (anxious voice)
                         Yes.

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                              (grimly)
                         Cold.

<b>                                     VOICE
</b>                              (near Preysing's elbow)
                         Mr. Preysing...

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                              (in same voice)
                         Yes...

<b>                                     BELLBOY
</b>                         Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --

               Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- 
               He walks out through the door...

<b>                                                     DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:
</b>
               Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA 
               TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.

               Bellboy is with Preysing.

<b>                                     BELLBOY
</b>                         Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his 
                         call.

<b>                                     GIRL
</b>                         Yes, Mr. Preysing --

               Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of 
               switchboard.

<b>                                     GIRL
</b>                              (nervously)
                         They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                              (to boy)
                         You told me it was on -- you said 
                         the call was through.
                              (he waits irritably)

                         long. And in the evening, they go 
                         around in full dress... Yes, sometimes 
                         I have pain, but I can stand it.

               from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.

               At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little 
               Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The 
               Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.

                         in front of loges?

               Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.

                         the dining car goes along.

               The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese 
               speaks volubly to his wife.

                         her. I'm her ballet master and her 
                         nurse. I hardly belong to myself

               As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to 
               Senf.

               This just covers the scene.

               The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them 
               has said which brings our attention to them again.

               At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.

               The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with 
               his one hand.

               He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... 
               then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get 
               Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception 
               desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every 
                         day is precious -- every hour -- 
                         Every minute.

               Second Clerk is looking straight at him.

               Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and 
               proceeds:

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         I came here because I wanted to live 
                         here, two weeks, maybe three -- God 
                         only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- 
                         I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- 
                         I'm ill -- I can't wait.

               As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is 
               watching.

               Assistant Manager enters.

<b>                                     ASSISTANT MANAGER
</b>                         Has the gentleman a complaint?

               Rohna and Kringelein speak together.

<b>                                     ROHNA
</b>                         The gentleman is dissatisfied with 
                         room number five fifty-nine.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         I certainly have a complaint -- and 
                         a fair one.

               He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov 
               enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The 
               bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and 
               looks up.

                         stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a 
                         room -- a big room -- like you would 
                         give General Director Preysing -- 
                         I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can 
                         pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you 
                         give him a little room, way up in 
                         the corner with the hot water pipes 
                         going -- bang -- bang -- bang...

               During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna 
               quietly. The manager how turns.

                         one-seventy-six, one of our most 
                         expensive rooms. It is large and on 
                         the front with bath.

                         Does that mean that the bath is my

                         That's what I want -- a large room 
                         on the front with a private bath -- 
                         Yes, that's what I want. I can pay 
                         now if you like.

               He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract 
               money.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         That will not be necessary.

               The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to 
               the new room.

               Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has 
               noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.

               In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.

               Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his 
               sleeve.

                              (he is impressed)

               Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly 
               popular.

               Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.

               At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where 
               he has bought the evening papers.

               Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.

               At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.

                         speak to me with a cigarette in your 
                         mouth.

               Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still 
               holds it in his hand.

               She crosses to elevator.

<b>               THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR

               As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns 
               around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking 
               down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see 
               on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.

               NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.

               The lift ascends.

<b>               UPPER CORRIDOR
</b>
               Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for 
               the numbers. She moves out of scene.

               The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move 
               straight down the hall.

               Pimenov is chatting volubly.

                         receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, 
                         trains, hotels -- hotels, trains 
                         theatre.

               We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. 
               Preysing's room.

<b>                                     PIMENOV

                         waking up and calling for me.

               He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of 
               his ballet.

               At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to 
               Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there 
               is an amusing exchange of glances between them.

               Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.

               Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He 
               stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.

               He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him 
               very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.

               approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that 
               Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues 
               whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: 
               "Are you mad?"

               Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is 
               going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to 
               keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes 
               out.

               At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his 
               doorway at the end of the passage.

               At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette 
               comes out into the hall.

               By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The

                         Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

               Suzette turns back into the room.

</b>
<b>               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
</b>
               It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are 
               drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of 
               silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow 
               Room below.

               In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers 
               which she has been mending.

               She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly 
               and looks off dramatically at...

<b>               GRUSINSKAYA
</b>
               Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, 
               on the chaise-lounge.

               Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand 
               which is outside the robe moves.

               The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards 
               Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the 
               chaise-lounge and is looking down.

               Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling 
               and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.

</b>                         It is time.

               Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly 
               upright --

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Always the performance -- every day 
                         the performance -- time for the 
                         performance.
                              (she pauses and droops 
                              suddenly)
                         I think, Suzette, I have never been 
                         so tired in my life.
                              (she takes the bottle 
                              of veronal which is 
                              nearby)
                         Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.

                              telephone)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
                         brought.

               While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of 
               a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to 
               the floor and although there is only one other woman in the 
               room -- she holds the robe around her.

               She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her 
               fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes 
               and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.

               There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.

               Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the 
               case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.

               Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.

               Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. 
               Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.

                         away -- so threadbare -- the Russians --

               Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away 
               in Russia -- she does not look --

               Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.

               There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.

               She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. 
               Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. 
               As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak 
               into telephone.

                              (she turns)

               Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will 
               deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.

               She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing-
               table and sits.

               It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just 
               temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very 
               near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with 
               her a revulsion against the word performance.

               Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he 
               attempts to soothe her.

               Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.

               Meierheim is pushing the elevator button.

               The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. 
               He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in 
               the distance.

               Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.

               The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a 
               glance at her.

               They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her 
               characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first 
               time they have met in the picture.

               She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she 
               turns to Suzette.

               Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes 
               the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel 
               case.

               Suzette hesitates.

               Suzette toddles off with the pearls.

               The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the 
               Baron and descends.

               A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.

               A shot of the reverse of him looking down.

               The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in 
               his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.

               Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, 
               confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit 
               Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other 
               people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the 
               great Grusinskaya.

               The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to 
               be echoed through the lobby.

               People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the 
               attention she is getting.

               THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she 
               sweeps outside of the hotel.

               The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. 
               He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.

               We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the 
               typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that 
               Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind 
               his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an 
               odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.

               Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's 
               room.

               The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse.

               During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her 
               fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist-
               watch.

               Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.

                         does her work well, -- seems so silly.

                         girls like me in offices. Personally, 
                         I hate offices -- I'd much rather be

               Crosses to window.

<b>               FACADE OF HOTEL
</b>
               The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He 
               proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is 
               apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.

               Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.

               Baron is pretty shaken by jump.

               Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing 
               coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud 
               speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:

<b>               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
</b>
               Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls 
               in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:
</b>
               Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud 
               speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene 
               bullying waiter.

<b>               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
</b>
               The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's 
               balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.

               Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is 
               locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers 
               refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd 
               way.

               As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off 
               of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the 
               operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's 
               room.

               He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger 
               prints off with his handkerchief.

               He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring 
               suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want 
               to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. 
               Crosses to the door again.

               Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's 
               voice singing an absurd song.

               He listens. She is coming in.

               The key turns in the door.

               Quickly he hides behind the curtains.

               Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, 
               enters the room.

               He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. 
               After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. 
               We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.

               The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear 
               from Preysing's radio.

               The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer 
               it but continues her duties.

               At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it 
               up and speaks.

<b>                                     CHAMBERMAID
</b>                         No -- no -- there is no one here.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears 
               at the open door.

<b>                                     INSPECTRESS
</b>                              (to Chambermaid)
                         You're late... What have you been 
                         doing?

<b>                                     CHAMBERMAID
</b>                              (grumbling)
                         Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come 
                         back - come back.' They won't get 
                         out of their rooms.

               The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around 
               the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking 
               at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking 
               for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it 
               is locked.

               Telephone bell rings again.

               Inspectress picks it up quickly.

<b>                                     INSPECTRESS

                         The Western Theater?... No...

               Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.

               Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.

                         Isn't she at the theatre?

               Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.

                         Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... 
                         No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at 
                         the hotel.

</b>
               During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid 
               out of the room. Business ad lib.

               Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the 
               telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.

<b>                                     MEIERHEIM

                         I haven't found her. Is Desprez 
                         dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all 
                         right. Keep the show going.

                         Wait till I see her, she'll pay for 
                         this -- this little trick is going 
                         to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach 
                         of contract.

</b>                         Her nerves... What about my nerves?... 
                         Who is she anyway? Where does she 
                         think she is -- Russia? Those days 
                         have passed.

               He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is 
               in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one 
               shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into 
               the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, 
               make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.

               The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to 
               pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.

<b>                                     MEIERHEIM

                         alone.

               Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, 
               waiting for Meierheim.

               Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.

                         madame. This is the end.
                              (he stamps out)

               Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it 
               on Meierheim's exit.

<b>               DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.
</b>
               It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to 
               door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and 
               throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses 
               slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the 
               strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.

               Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.

<b>               FLASH OF BARON

               Watching her.

<b>               GRUSINSKAYA

               Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. 
               Then she becomes weary again.

               With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the 
               curtain -- where the Baron is standing.

<b>               BARON

               We see him tense himself.

               She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out 
               of scene.

               He peeps around the curtains.

               She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks 
               steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her 
               hands and we hear her say:

               Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.

               Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across 
               the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and 
               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.

               She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, 
               places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are 
               quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- 
               asks for the theatre.

               Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she 
               commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. 
               Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.

               She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into 
               the telephone --

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. 
                         I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... 
                         No, no don't --
                              (long pause)
                         ...Just alone... Good night, good 
                         night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, 
                         how is it going, badly?... Uh?... 
                         Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- 
                         and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- 
                         they didn't miss me?... They didn't 
                         miss me.
                              (she lets her hand 
                              drop with the receiver 
                              and goes on talking 
                              into the air)
                         They didn't miss me -- good night, 
                         Pimenov...

               She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in 
               her hand, unreplaced.

               The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind 
               her the Baron peers from the closet.

               Her head sinks down upon her hands.

               A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts 
               the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice 
               of Opehlia, she speaks:

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                              (with great humility)
                         Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have 
                         finished.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It 
               is in fact, ballet.

               Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. 
               She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the 
               table, or hangs it over the telephone.

               She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the 
               Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.

               We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. 
               "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses 
               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. 
               She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. 
               She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.

               She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded 
               hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.

               The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he 
               looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for 
               the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his 
               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.

               It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.

               At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his 
               hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her 
               bed.

               She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer 
               who has heard something, then reassured. She places the 
               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is 
               quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her 
               head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal 
               and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away 
               upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance 
               herself.

               The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to 
               the bedside noiselessly and stands there.

               She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the 
               glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.

               She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the 
               floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal 
               falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a 
               sitting position.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.

               She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be 
               coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the 
               bed.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Careful -- there's broken glass on 
                         the floor.

               Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her 
               kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse 
               of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she 
               is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be 
               a silly movement.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         There.
                              (takes a pillow from 
                              the bed throws it 
                              upon the floor over 
                              the glass, steps 
                              back)

               She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which 
               was lying across the back of a chair.

               Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She 
               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron 
               puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances 
               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this 
               man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense 
               of relief with her. She is trembling.

               The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his 
               danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand 
               marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she 
               will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He 
               could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or 
               silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating 
               sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Nothing -- only to be here.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         But surely you must know -- because 
                         I love you.

</b>                         Because you love me -- you love me?

               She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she 
               throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more 
               passionately.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                              (going over to her)
                         Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do 
                         you good to cry? Are you afraid? 
                         Shall I go?

</b>                         I was so alone -- always alone -- 
                         and suddenly you were there and said 
                         that.
                              (sitting up)
                         No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Don't cry -- it tears my heart to 
                         see you sob like that.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                              (regaining control)
                         Nerves -- just nerves. You must 
                         forgive me. I have had a bad evening. 
                         I am very tired. Do you know what it 
                         is to be tired -- tired of a routine 
                         existence?

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         I'm afraid not -- I usually do just 
                         what I feel like doing at the moment.

               A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the 
               situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her 
               robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial 
               Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She 
               sweeps across the room.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         So you feel like coming into a lady's 
                         room -- and you come... What now?

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                              (following her)

</b>                         Certainly.

               She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds 
               it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.

                         how I slaved and slaved for 
                         Grusinskaya -- for the success of

                         Just someone who has found that on 
                         the day success ceases life ceases -- 
                         Are you listening to me -- Do you

                         Just for a minute then.

               Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --

               She whispers.

</b>                         You -- man...

               The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She 
               has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting 
               and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.

               (NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)

               She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. 
               She can't find the other.

               Business as he gets other slipper for her.

               He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.

                              (she turns, her mood 
                              has changed)
                         What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya 
                         weeping is a sight worth seeing. It 
                         is many years since she did such a 
                         thing... You frightened me -- badly. 
                         You're responsible for this -- painful 
                         scene.

               He watches her.

               The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating 
               warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, 
               volubly.

                         Discipline means doing what you don't 
                         want to do and take no pleasure in 
                         doing. Do you know what I mean? Have

               Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.

                         you come. You take pleasure in a

                              frankly)
                         I should like to smoke.

               She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes 
               her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing 
               table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds 
               out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.

                              (he pauses suddenly)

                         woman's bedroom.

               Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses 
               it. A long tender and sincere embrace.

               Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his 
               whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages 
               herself.

               He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.

               Her head falls slowly on his breast.

<b>               FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN

               approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.

               They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's 
               room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is 
               characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A 
               distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for 
               the first time by alcohol.

               Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon 
               his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.

               THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because 
               the Doctor has paused at the door.

                         But Doctor --

               But the Doctor has gone.

               Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the 
               mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.

               He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. 
               Imitating the doctor, he repeats:

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN

                         good night.

               He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.

               He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the 
               carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm 
               and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass 
               and some water which he sees standing on the night table by 
               his bed.

               He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with 
               water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine 
               bottles.

               His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.

               He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- 
               his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.

               He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops 
               into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden 
               impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine 
               away.

               With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song 
               that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid 
               song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters 
               around the room, undressing.

                         became famous and whoever is famous 
                         is alone... But why should I be

               She puts the coffee down on the table.

               Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee 
               down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily 
               crested cigarette case of the Baron.

</b>                              (enthusiastically)
                         Oh, yes, Suzette.

<b>                                     SUZETTE
</b>                         Madam will dress now, it is late.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Five minutes, Suzette, come back in 
                         five minutes. I'll ring.

<b>                                     SUZETTE
</b>                         Yes, madam Suzette knows all about 
                         it.

               She is a French woman. She is pleased.

<b>                                     SUZETTE
</b>                         Madam is beautiful this morning.

               As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Yes, Suzette.

               Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings 
               open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         You must go now.

               As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a 
               dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to 
               the telephone.

</b>                         There -- it begins.

               With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and 
               speaks.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...

               During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A 
               charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. 
               His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers 
               the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                              (to Baron)
                         No --

               During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns 
               suddenly --

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA
</b>                         What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you 
                         mad? We always have great success in 
                         Vienna... Certainly not. Come here 
                         and see me... yes... good-bye.

               She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.

               The telephone rings again.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA

                         There -- the day begins... I must go 
                         to rehearsal.

               She lets the telephone ring.

               They move towards the door.

               Telephone starts ringing.

               She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.

                              (he kisses her)
                         He leaves.

               Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes 
               deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks 
               at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses 
               them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.

<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA

                         Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are 
                         you, in your room? Come, I will see 
                         you now... hurry.

               She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a 
               tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, 
               she is indeed younger.

               Suzette is putting out a dark dress.

</b>                         Not that dark dress -- something 
                         light -- bright -- it's a sunny 
                         morning, Suzette.

               Suzette happily glances at her.

               There is a knock at the door.

               Pimenov enters, before he can speak --

                         Good morning, Gru -- your --

               Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:

                         Quickly. I will be there --

               During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is 
               busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.

               Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him 
               the cigarette case on the table.

               As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost 
               sweeps Suzette to the door with him.

                         you.

               They leave.

               Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the 
               telephone.

               This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a

               Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following 
               the chauffeur.

               The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop 
               and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the

               CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron 
               in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop 
               waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of 
               orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.

               The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns 
               up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed

               We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, 
               closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the 
               conference room.

               We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing 
               all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains 
               of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business 
               battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on 
               his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a 
               pretty picture.

               Preysing has not moved.

               Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry 
               the signature.

               Preysing does not answer.

               Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.

</b>                         Well -- the deal has been put through.

               Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.

               During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, 
               glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions 
               to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing 
               is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying

               Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.

               Flaemmchen watches him quickly.

               It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's 
               distress.

               Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. 
               Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it.

               Kringelein starts to laugh.

               The Baron steps into the scene.

               The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.

               The house detective, later identified, is talking to the 
               chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.

               Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.

               He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing 
               to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron 
               money. Charming scene.

               Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. 
               People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.

               As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly 
               aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.

               During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As 
               Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the 
               Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his 
               mind miles away.

                         straits.

               Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something 
               that is on her mind.

               A curious little scene.

               She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. 
               The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to 
               Kringelein.

</b>
<b>               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
</b>
               Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are 
               playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., 
               on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The 
               game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the 
               monotonous words of the players.

               White faced, the Baron has the bank.

               Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach 
               the table.

               Kringelein's back is to us.

               They are smart people, not professional gamblers.

               There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around 
               tightly. We do not see the cards.

               The following voices are heard:

<b>                                     BARON'S VOICE
</b>                         All right, gentlemen.

</b>                         Yes -- me.

               Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         Is that too much, Baron?

                              own money)
                         No -- not at all.

               There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. 
               Kringelein takes cards.

                         Don't show them.

               Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a 
               new game.

               The Baron deals himself a card.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN

                         What do I do now?

               The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to 
               take him to Vienna.

<b>                                     A MAN

                         win, don't I --
                              (he turns the card up)

               The Baron rises.

                         champagne is expensive and good. I'm 
                         winning more than I used to earn in 
                         a year -- double what I used to earn.
                              (he is counting his 
                              money)

               They hand him the cards.

               Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.

               At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- 
               his face is white -- he has lost.

               Kringelein has come to the Baron.

                              (he puts bills in 
                              Baron's hand.)

               Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking 
               plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.

<b>                                     BARON

                         I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, 
                         Baron and to win.
                              (he drinks)
                         It's good, -- come along, Baron.

               They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the 
               bank.

</b>                         All of that at once, Baron?

               The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't 
               understand.

<b>                                     BARON

                         Nine.

               The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and 
               turns to Kringelein:

               Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down 
               on the table.

               Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another 
               drink.

                              (he points)
                         Look at that.

               He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's 
               voice:

               Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron 
               approaches table.

                              (he is pulling money 
                              towards him, counting

                              frantically, not the

               During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has 
               answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back 
               now.

                         play against him. I put my hat down 
                         here, somewhere. I think I'll have a 
                         drink before I go. By the way, I've

               Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been 
               like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up 
               suddenly, sees men are leaving --

                              feet)

               By this time the men are pausing by the door.

                         I'm so grateful to you -- it's been 
                         so marvelous. The first time in my

                         Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but 
                         it's the first time in my life I've

                         Splendid!

               There is a general feeling in the room that although this 
               man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no 
               wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a 
               nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has 
               reached an emotional pitch.

                         believe me -- a man must know death 
                         and not until then does a man know 
                         anything about life.

               General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. 
               Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him 
               goodnight.

               The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's 
               shoulder.

               Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men 
               are nearing the door.

               Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully 
               making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows 
               behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his 
               hands are limp.

               By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course 
               know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from 
               Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.

               We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see 
               his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his 
               inside pocket --

               He stands looking down at Kringelein.

                              bed -- takes out a 
                              cigarette, moves to 
                              the table. He seizes 
                              his drink)

               We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.

<b>                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE

                         my pocketbook.

               Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.

               The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         There is no pocketbook here... On 
                         the floor probably.
                              (He glances down)

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                              (starting up suddenly)
                         More than fourteen thousand marks... 
                         were in that pocketbook.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                              (looking at Baron)
                         Fourteen thousand marks... One can 
                         travel -- one's happiness might depend 
                         on fourteen thousand marks -- don't 
                         you think so, Baron?

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                              (with a shrug)
                         Quite possibly.

               At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the 
               ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         Oh, I've got to find it.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         Stay where you are.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         No -- I must find it --
                              (he starts talking)
                         Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
                              (he pulls himself to 
                              the side of the bed)

               The doctor goes to restrain him.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         I'm all right, Doctor. There's no 
                         pain now -- only you don't know what 
                         that money means to a man like me.

               He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the 
               floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, 
               his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets 
               under the card table.

               The Doctor looks at the Baron.

               The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                              (talking at intervals 
                              as he crawls looking 
                              for money)
                         You don't know, because you've never 
                         lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and 
                         saved and scrimped. My life hangs 
                         upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives 
                         you anything. You have to buy 
                         everything and pay cash for it. I 
                         wanted to pay for my last days with 
                         that money. Every hour costs money. 
                         I've nothing -- nothing but that 
                         pocketbook.
                              (he crawls along the 
                              floor on his hands 
                              and knees talking to 
                              the carpet as he 
                              looks)
                         I must have it back.
                              (he pauses breathless -- 
                              like an animal along 
                              the wall -- looking 
                              up at the men)

               The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action 
               in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it 
               is not a long speech:

               The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites 
               his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a 
               thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped 
               him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity 
               for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the 
               time the Doctor watches.

               The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting 
               conscience.

               Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during 
               rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but 
               piercing, says:

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         He must find his money, Baron.
                              (next time)
                         Mr. Kringelein should find his 
                         pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?

               These are two interjections.

               And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little 
               sack of pain, his head down.

               The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking 
               for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and 
               turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his 
               voice as he says:

<b>                                     BARON

                         pocketbook, Kringelein.

</b>                              (his head coming up)
                         Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found 
                         it -- you found it for me, Baron.

<b>                                     BARON

                         Goodnight, Kringelein.
                              (he moves towards the 
                              door.)

                         don't go -- don't leave me alone, 
                         Baron.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

<b>                                     KRINGELEIN
</b>                         No.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Come, get up -- come let me help 
                         you.

               NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- 
               If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         You're all right now -- it's very 
                         late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

</b>                         Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

               Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the 
               play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.

<b>                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
</b>                         Goodnight, Baron.

</b>                         Goodnight.
                              (his hand presses on 
                              Kringelein's shoulder -- 
                              he exits)

<b>                                                              CUT OUT INTO:
</b>
<b>               CORRIDOR
</b>
               Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of 
               the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In 
               his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience 
               feel his problem with him.

               This man who has lived and whistled and love through the 
               play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron 
               has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his 
               hair back.

               Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. 
               He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of 
               Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The 
               Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. 
               He walks down the corridor.

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Flaemmchen, what are you doing here 
                         in the middle of the night.

<b>                                     FLAEMMCHEN
</b>                         Looking for my room -- one sixty-
                         six.

<b>                                     BARON

                              (she points to door -- 
                              she looks at him a 
                              long time)

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Oh!

<b>                                     FLAEMMCHEN
</b>                         Yes -- oh!

<b>                                     BARON
</b>                         Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

<b>                                     FLAEMMCHEN
</b>                         And Baron, thanks so much for 
                         everything.

               They both go into their respective rooms.

               Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh 
               Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of 
               funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about 
               themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically 
               for the want of a little money.

<b>               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM
</b>
               Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp 
               burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining 
               door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts 
               down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his 
               door. She peeps through.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM
</b>
               from her angle.

               Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and 
               on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's 
               picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake 
               because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his 
               hand.

<b>               FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN
</b>
               An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and 
               he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes 
               the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and 
               takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, 
               lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts 
               at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.

<b>               SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR
</b>
               The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the 
               adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room 
               the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he 
               is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks 
               hoarsely, quietly.

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                         Flaemmchen!
                              (he seizes her to him)

               She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. 
               She is passive -- cold.

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                              (breathlessly)
                         You are late. I've been waiting for 
                         you -- waiting.

<b>                                     FLAEMMCHEN
</b>                         I had to arrange about the trip.

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                         You're sweet.

<b>                                     FLAEMMCHEN
</b>                         You think so?

               He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately 
               avoids his kiss.

<b>                                     PREYSING
</b>                              (awkwardly)

                              (he sits heavily on

               There is a pause for a moment.

               He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his 
               fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto 
               the balcony.

               Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the 
               street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a 
               shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. 
               Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves 
               forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French 
               window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively 
               searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar 
               is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. 
               He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face 
               watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, 
               pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.

                              telephone)

               The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, 
               pulls at the knob.

               The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at 
               his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, 
               (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and 
               one hand holding the Baron.

               Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. 
               The action excites him.

               With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down 
               upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). 
               In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.

               By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing 
               come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.

               New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the 
               receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He 
               is terrified.

               Door opens behind him.

               Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, 
               crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing 
               seizes her.

               Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we 
               think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She 
               is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can 
               hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the 
               traffic below.

               Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, 
               it is the first time we have been conscious of it.

               With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. 
               It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own 
               room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from 
               her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears 
               through her own room.

               Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. 
               After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running 
               across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a 
               Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What 
               the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to 
               scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks 
               around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She 
               will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. 
               Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.

               The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor 
               had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers 
               and shirt.

               Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes

               It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must 
               have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a 
               strength.

                         it's awful.

               She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed.

               Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.

               Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a 
               crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves.

               WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses

               Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is 
               open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds 
               has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying -- 
               a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come 
               around as Kringelein enters.

               Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.

               Grusinskaya crosses to the desk. She speaks to Senf.

               At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out of 
               the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase.

               A bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein, still 
               confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the 
               bellboy.

               Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a 
               transformation. He stands and with a flourish hands the 
               suitcase over to the boy. He is a big man now.

               Kringelein pays and taking Flaemmchen's arm starts to move 
               away from the desk, General business ad lib of tipping. Boys 
               line up, making a deep bow. There is almost a triumphant 
               march as Kringelein and Flaemmchen move towards the door.

                         Come again, your Excellency.

               With head erect, happy smile on his face, Kringelein leaves 
               the lobby. Normal activity in lobby, reminding us of opening 
               scene. Doctor comes up to desk.
