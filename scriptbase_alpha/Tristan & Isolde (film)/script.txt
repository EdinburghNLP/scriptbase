               Britain the Dark Ages

               The Roman Empire has fallen.

               The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes.

               To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, 
               protected by the sea.
 
               Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued 
               the Britons.
 
               Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never 
               be allowed to unite.

                         When can I have a stag?

                                     ARAGON
                          a stag?

                                     TRISTAN
                         Oh come on!

               TRISTAN + ISOLDE
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Why would they join up against the Irish?
 
                         
                                     ARAGON
                         Because someone has to stand up to them.
 
                         
                                     TRISTAN
                         You?

                                     ARAGON
                         Me, Marke, all the tribes. We can’t 
                         resist alone.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         I could.

               [Castle Tantallon appears onscreen]

                                     ARAGON
                         Oh my little warrior. We have to be 
                         careful.
 
               

               [Tristan and his father enter the bustling village]

                                     ARAGON
                         Come home without something for your 
                         Lady there will be hell to pay.
 
               [Tristan goes to a flower and herb seller]

                                     TRISTAN
                         Can I?

               [Aragon continues on into town where he is met by one of his 
               men]
 
                                     MAN
                         The Angles have arrives my Lord, as 
                         well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes 
                         and the Saxons.
 
                                     ARAGON
                         Good. With Marke, all will be here.
 
                         
                                     MAN
                          Yeah. It is a great day.

                                     ARAGON
                         Let us hope so.

               [They continue on into town. We see Tristan back at the herb 
               sellers]
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         Thanks.

               [The boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs. Going up 
               to Lady Marke he hands her the finished wreath]
 
                                     LADY MARKE
                         We heard the news...

                                     TRISTAN
                         Mother, I made this for you

               [Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristan’s face lovingly]

               

               [In the Main Hall of Aragon, the assembled tribe Lords gather 
               in meet]
 
                                     ARAGON
                         Friends, look at us.

               [A map of Britain is shown]

                                     ARAGON
                         The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. 
                         Just as the Irish like us. But if we 
                         were one land united, we would out number 
                         them two to one. We could defeat them 
                         once and for all. That is why we are 
                         here today, to sign this treaty of unification.
 
                         
                                     LORD
                         But who would be King?

                                     ARAGON
                         The strongest among us: Lord Marke.
 
                         
               [Scene of movement outside of the town]

                                     ARAGON
                         Look if you are happy sending all of 
                         your gold to Ireland, living as slaves 
                         then by all means do nothing.
 
                                     BARON
                         If we were happy doing that then we 
                         would never have risked coming here.
 
                         
                                     MARKE
                         Friends. My wife is with child, my heart 
                         tells me it is a boy. I want him to 
                         grow old in a land where all of us, 
                         all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, 
                         Saxon are at peace. This island has 
                         not known unity since the Romans left. 
                         That is why I sign this treaty. 
 
                                     WICTRED
                         And why should we follow you?

                                     MARKE
                         Perhaps, Wictred, because your last 
                         attempt to form an alliance without 
                         the knowledge of half the Barons in 
                         this room has failed.
 
               [A man bursts into the room]

                                     ARAGON
                          Go!!!

               [More destruction. All the women and children try to find safety]

                         Tristan! Hurry! Come this way.

               [More fighting. In the main keep the men await the Irish]

               destruction and fire breaks out. Tristan reaches up to touch 
               the floorboards above and finds his fathers seeping blood on 
               his hands. Tristan comes out of the hole and surveys the destruction. 
               His father and Lady Marke are dead. Suddenly he is attacked by 
               an Irishman but Marke jumps in to save him, losing his hand in

                         It was an ill fever that took her. Fever.

                         Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. 
                         An absolute gentleman.

                         I thought... earlier when you spoke 
                         of wanting something you can’t have.

                         That doesn’t mean it isn’t true. It 
                         is. It just cannot be. I want to know 
                         that you are alive somewhere thinking 
                         of me from time to time. I want to know 
                         that there is more to this life and 
                         I can’t know that if they kill you.

                         We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it 
                         is just his rotted corpse we'll find, 
                         for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt 
                         is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae,

                         As am I by her grief.

                         We should assulat the British straight

                         Maximum force. Like that of Marke’s 
                         tribe with the maximum force you speak 
                         of? I will not confront them again until 
                         our numbers are refreshed. Until then, 
                         we’ll have cunning divide them.

                         and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to 
                         whichever English tribe wins. It is 
                         a clever way of setting us against each 
                         other.

                         Tristan is dead. My people have suffered 
                         enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse 
                         as more real than any alliance. My mind 
                         is set.

                         one, capable of guiding you if the need 
                         should arise. He is a man of passion, 
                         fierce in battle who has learnt to tame 
                         his heart with his head. I give you 
                         Tristan of Aragon.

                         to be second. You are. I will only be 
                         king if you are my second. I’d put it

                         and in the end all they hold is days 
                         and days without love. Love is made
