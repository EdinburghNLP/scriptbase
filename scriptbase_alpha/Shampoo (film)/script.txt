Shampoo - by Robert Towne and Warren Beatty


     
     DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968
     
     A darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is
     a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
     PLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and
     still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be
     married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
     
     Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and
     rhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also
     WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Oh, no.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          ... what?...
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          That headboard.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Nobody can hear it.
     
     It BANGS a couple of more times.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          I can. It makes me nervous.
     
     It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging
     of the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps.
     Silence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
               (complimentary)
          Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus
          Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
     
     The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
               (a slightly different
               tone)
          You going to answer it?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
               (meaning no)
          Uh-uh.
     
     It CONTINUES TO RING.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
               (being for her very
               mischievous)
          Want me to?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Let it ring.
     
     And it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other
     considerations.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't
          give up.
     
     After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Hello...
               (a little surprised)
          Ah, hi.
     
     The GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD
     only FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his
     ear. It is TINA.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
          What took you so long?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Wasn't sure it was you.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
               (muffled)
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I... uh... I... uh... can't.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
               (laughter, sizing it up
               immediately)
          All right, who're you with? Jill?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          No.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
               (lively but muffled)
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          No.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
               (she's heard Felicia)
          Awww --
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I'll call you back.
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
          Come on by.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I'll call you back...
     
                    TINA'S VOICE
               (raucous laughter,
               muffled)
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
               (to Tina)
          Okay, okay...
     
     He hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and
     coughed.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          You're rude. I mean, you're very
          rude.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Hey, I tried to get her off the
          phone.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          You know what I'm talking about.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          No, baby. Now look, that girl that
          called -- I have to talk to her,
          she'll do something.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Like what?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I don't know, kill herself. She's
          O.D.'d four times.
     
     This calms Felicia. A pause.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Well, is she your girlfriend?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          No.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Are you in love with her?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Her?
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Are you?
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          No.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Then it's not your problem.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          It isn't?
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          No. You know too many sick ladies.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I guess so.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          How do you expect to get anything
          done if you allow yourself to get
          sidetracked? Particularly in your
          business... you deal with women
          every day...
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I guess so.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          Don't worry, honey, I'll protect
          you.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Okay.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE
          God, I adore you.
     
     She starts to kiss him, the SHEETS are RUSTLING. The PHONE
     RINGS.
     
                    FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Shit.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Hello.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
          You're home.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Yeah.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
          I'm coming over.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          I'll call you back.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
               (firm but frightened)
          No you won't.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          What do you mean?
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
          I told you I get 'scared up here,
          so if you're not coming right
          now...
               (muffled)
          I'm not kidding.
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Okay.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
               (muffled)
     
                    GEORGE'S VOICE
          Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
     
     George flips on the light.
     
                    FELICIA
          Whoever she is, she doesn't give
          up, does she?
     
                    GEORGE
          No.
     
     Bare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something.
     
                    FELICIA
          What're you looking for?
     
                    GEORGE
          My keys.
     
                    FELICIA
          I thought you said you weren't
          going anywhere.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this
          friend of mine for a few minutes.
     
                    FELICIA
          You mean that girl, don't you?
     
     George finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes,
     a pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt. He
     leaves his shorts and socks on the floor. He's obviously in a
     hurry.
     
                    GEORGE
          What girl, she's not a girl, she's
          just a friend of mine.
     
     Felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.
     
                    FELICIA
          You son of a bitch.
     
     George sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Wait, at least wait 'til I'm
          dressed. I'm going.
     
     She starts to get out of bed.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Oh, Christ -- do you have any
          Kleenex?
     
     George is a little desperate now. He runs to the bathroom,
     tosses her the whole box.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Thanks a lot.
     
                    GEORGE
               (desperate)
          Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
     
                    FELICIA
          Why not?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll be right back, it's just that
          this girl is a different girl...
          she has attacks.
     
                    FELICIA
          What?
     
                    GEORGE
          These attacks... it's got something
          to do with her... uh... pancreas.
     
     George is trying to remember the rest.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          She's got a...
     
                    FELICIA
               (suddenly interested)
          Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
     
                    GEORGE
               (anxious to go now)
          Yeah, I think so.
     
                    FELICIA
          That's very serious. Who's her
          doctor?
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know.
     
                    FELICIA
          Gee, that's very serious...
     
                    GEORGE
          I know.
     
                    FELICIA
          Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic
          ulcer.
     
                    GEORGE
          She did?
     
                    FELICIA
          It turned out to be cancer.
     
                    GEORGE
          Wow.
     
                    FELICIA
          So what are you doing going over
          there? You're not her doctor.
     
                    GEORGE
          I've gotta give her some pills.
          Percodan, she ran out.
     
     Before Felicia can say anymore, George goes to the bathroom
     and grabs the first pill jar he can find, moves to Felicia
     and kisses her.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          And listen, I'll be right back and
          I want your ass in that bed when I
          get back.
     
                    FELICIA
               (acquiescing)
          You're very rude... if you don't
          come back --
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll be back in a while.
     
                    FELICIA
          I don't want to see you anymore.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll be right back, baby, really.
     
     EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT
     
     George on his bike threads through traffic on the Strip. OVER
     this, we HEAR A FEW BARS of THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS "Monday,
     Monday." He pulls up to a signal beside a faded Eugene
     McCarthy billboard. Somebody HONKS.
     
                    GIRL'S VOICE
          George!
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, baby, what's happening!
     
                    GIRL
               (not bad)
          Nothing, my sister's back from
          Vegas.
     
                    GEORGE
          That's too bad.
     
                    GIRL
          I have to see you.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, stop by the shop.
     
     He takes off. Winds through alleys and heads up the hill to
     Jill's. It's a shortcut whose precision should make it
     obvious he's traveled it a number of times.
     
     EXT. AT JILL'S - NIGHT
     
     George jumps off his bike and pounds on the door.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
               (soft)
          Who is it?
     
                    GEORGE
               (furious)
          Who do you think it is?
     
     JILL opens the door. She's shaking.
     
                    JILL
          There were some shots.
     
                    GEORGE
          What're you talking about?
     
                    JILL
          Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
     
                    GEORGE
               (looking around)
          Where?
     
                    JILL
          Here in the canyon.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, it's a big canyon.
               (seeing she's upset)
          Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get
          back... just for a minute.
     
                    JILL
          Let me come, too.
               (pleading)
          Please don't leave me alone.
     
                    GEORGE
          What's gonna happen?
     
                    JILL
               (near tears)
          I don't know... every once in a
          while I just get the feeling
          something awful's going to happen.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, like what?
     
                    JILL
          I don't know... just... somebody's
          going to get me.
     
     Jill starts to cry. She ambles into the carport in her
     nightgown.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
          I've had these dumb dreams lately.
     
                    GEORGE
          What?
     
                    JILL
          They're dumb, somebody... I don't
          know...
     
                    GEORGE
               (suspicious)
          Who?
     
                    JILL
          I just... who what?
     
                    GEORGE
          You said somebody... who?
     
     She's not answering.
     
                    JILL
          I don't know. I can't remember. It
          was just in my dream.
     
                    GEORGE
          No shit?
     
     Jill laughs. George comes over to her.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Nobody's gonna get you. Now get
          inside.
     
                    JILL
               (uncertain)
          George, I don't --
     
                    GEORGE
          You'll do what I tell you. Now get
          the fuck inside.
     
     She backs inside. He moves in after her.
     
                    JILL
          George --
     
                    GEORGE
               (moving after her)
          Keep moving --
     
                    JILL
          Now, George --
     
                    GEORGE
          Nobody's gonna get you but me!
     
     He leaps after her and she screams, delighted. George chases
     her into the bedroom. Jill screams. He throws her on the bed
     and leaps on top of her, kissing her. She likes it.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          How are you, baby?
     
                    JILL
          Fine. How are you?
     
                    GEORGE
          Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic.
          Incredible. Incredible, really
          incredible.
     
                    JILL
          What?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm
          gonna open the shop. I'm getting it
          together.
     
                    JILL
          How?
     
                    GEORGE
               (rising)
          Right now -- I'm at the epitome of
          my life.
          Right now I feel so good I'm afraid
          something's gonna happen.
     
     He gets off the bed. Jill is fascinated.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          When I was a little kid, I used to
          want to go to Europe but right now
          wherever I am I'm gonna be in
          Europe.
     
                    JILL
          Honey, what happened?
     
                    GEORGE
          I just came from a meeting... I
          can't talk about it now, baby. But
          in a few days -- see I'm disgusted
          with my life.
     
                    JILL
          I thought you said you were at the
          epitome of your life.
     
                    GEORGE
          I am, I am. But I've had it with
          chicks. They're like an
          occupational hazard. Six guys
          working for me... I'm gonna retire
          or settle down or something.
     
                    JILL
          What about me?
     
                    GEORGE
               (meaning it)
          You're different.
     
                    JILL
          I am?
     
                    GEORGE
          You're great.
     
                    JILL
          I am?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
                    JILL
          Do you really mean that?
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with
          you.
     
     He kisses her. They start rolling around on the bed.
     
                    JILL
          Honey?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, baby.
     
                    JILL
          Why am I great?
     
     George is a little annoyed.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jesus, I don't know. You're great.
     
     Jill looks a little perplexed.
     
                    JILL
          Will we live together?
     
                    GEORGE
          We live together now.
     
                    JILL
          But in the same house, you know,
          one house.
     
                    GEORGE
               (just a slight hitch)
          -- Sure.
     
     She hugs him.
     
     INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - LATER
     
     George in bed, beginning to sleep. Hubert Humphrey expresses
     opinion at his chances tomorrow on TV.
     
                    JILL
          Maybe you don't even like children.
     
                    GEORGE
          Of course I like children.
     
                    JILL
          You've never even been around one.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm around you and I like you,
          don't I?
     
                    JILL
               (smiling despite herself)
          Yeah.
     
                    GEORGE
          Okay...
               (sinking back down)
          Night, baby.
     
                    JILL
               (after a moment)
          George?
     
                    GEORGE
          What!
     
                    JILL
          Not right now, I don't mean right
          now... but eventually...
     
                    GEORGE
               (grumpy)
          Okay, baby. Okay...
     
                    JILL
          Jackie says she wouldn't bring
          children into this world. That it's
          hypocritical and overpopulated.
     
     EXT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
     
     A FEW BARS OF THE BEATLES AND "SGT. PEPPER" OVER George on
     bike whipping into bank parking lot.
     
     INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
     
     George sits talking, with MR. PETTIS, a bank vice president.
     He is perspiring a little. Somebody's breathing rather
     heavily. It's Mr. Pettis seated behind his desk now and
     opposite George. He's going over something.
     
                    PETTIS
               (looking up now)
          Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about
          you.
     
                    GEORGE
               (smiling)
          Right.
     
                    PETTIS
          How is she?
     
                    GEORGE
          Great.
     
                    PETTIS
          Wonderful woman.
     
                    GEORGE
          She is.
     
                    PETTIS
          I went to school with her husband.
     
                    GEORGE
          Great.
     
                    PETTIS
               (pleasantly affirmative)
          So you want to go in business for
          yourself?
     
                    GEORGE
          Right.
     
                    PETTIS
          And you need money?
     
                    GEORGE
          Right, that's right.
     
                    PETTIS
               (smiling)
          You do know what money's like these
          days.
     
                    GEORGE
               (no)
          Well, yeah... you know.
     
     Pettis grabs a sheet off his desk, one in plastic containing
     rates.
     
                    PETTIS
          Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and
          three quarters -- that's our prime
          rate. And I'll tell you something
          else: the big boys are going for
          it.
     
                    GEORGE
          They are?
     
                    PETTIS
          After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying
          six percent. Six percent. FHA's at
          eight and a half -- no, we won't be
          going back to the old days.
     
                    GEORGE
          I guess not...
     
                    PETTIS
          It's got nothing to do with
          inflation. Rates, for example, rise
          independently of tight money if you
          look at interest curves carefully.
          Historically, that's always been
          true, though most people don't
          realize it.
     
     An uncomfortable pause.
     
                    PETTIS (CONT'D)
          What sort of references do you
          have?
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, I do Barbara Rush.
     
                    PETTIS
          Pardon me?
     
                    GEORGE
               (embarrassed now)
          Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
     
                    PETTIS
          I mean credit references, Mr.
          Roundy.
     
     EXT. MELROSE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
     
     Jill Haynes and JACKIE SHAWN, in mini skirts and boots, are
     having coffee at one of the interior decorator hangouts
     outdoors off Melrose in West Hollywood.
     
     A CAR HONKS. A Cadillac pulls up to the curb. Its occupant
     HONKS again, obviously trying to attract their attention.
     Jill starts to look over.
     
                    JACKIE
          I think you're crazy. Don't look
          over, it's Lenny Silverman.
     
                    JILL
          Who is that?
     
                    JACKIE
               (deadly)
          A real swinger. He's been trying to
          fuck me for about two hundred
          years.
     
     LEONARD is now calling Jackie's name. Jackie can't avoid it
     anymore.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (pleasantly)
          Hi, Leonard.
     
                    LEONARD
          Jackie, what're you doing?
     
                    JACKIE
               (they're having coffee)
          Going for a pony ride at
          Kiddielands, want to come along?
     
                    LEONARD
          I have to meet a client... who're
          you dating?
     
     Jackie looks off and spots a billboard.
     
                    JACKIE
          Poster-Kleiser.
     
                    LEONARD
          Oh yeah?
     
                    JACKIE
          That's right.
     
                    LEONARD
          I'll call you.
     
                    JACKIE
          Fine.
     
                    LEONARD
          See you later.
     
                    JACKIE
          Anyway, you're crazy.
     
                    JILL
          I am? I mean why?
     
                    JACKIE
          Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
     
                    JILL
          I'm not. Maybe I am.
     
                    JACKIE
          No, listen. He's a very good
          hairdresser.
     
     Jill looks at Jackie.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Well, he is.
     
                    JILL
               (annoyed)
          So what's your point?
     
                    JACKIE
          Jill, I'm just trying to be
          helpful.
     
                    JILL
          I know, I'm sorry.
     
                    JACKIE
          I spent three years with him. I
          just couldn't take it not knowing
          who was gonna pay the rent... his
          unemployment or mine. George was
          adorable but it drove me crackers.
          Now at least I'm comfortable.
          Lester does what he says he'll do.
          Maybe you're happy living like a
          gypsy. Are you?
     
                    JILL
          George is great but I know what you
          mean.
     
                    JACKIE
          Face it, you can go around with
          cute guys and get hung up on their
          sexy bodies and things like that
          but sooner or later you've got to
          find somebody. Face it, time isn't
          on your side.
     
                    JILL
          I guess not.
     
     INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
     
     George and Mr. Pettis.
     
                    GEORGE
               (giving it all he's got)
          I've got the customers... that's my
          point. I'm the one they want. If I
          had my own shop, they'd leave and
          come to me. I have a lot of
          customers.
     
                    PETTIS
          Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you
          make out a financial statement?
          It'll save us both some time. Miss
          Michaels here can show you... have
          it notarized and we'll see where we
          go from there. Miss Michaels, would
          you get me a couple of forms?
     
     Pettis rises, shakes George's hand and disappears. George is
     left with MISS MICHAELS, who has been more or less within
     earshot of the whole conversation. George is very upset.
     
     INT. OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
     
     Jill thumbs through a Life magazine with Eldridge Cleaver on
     the cover, waiting for an interview in the outer office of
     the 9000 Building whose open window overlooks a smoggy chunk
     of the city.
     
     She's one of so many girls that at first she's not
     recognizable. All of them have composites which they carry in
     leather folders. They eye each other uneasily.
     
     INT. INTERVIEW OFFICE - DAY
     
     There is the PRODUCER, Barry, and the director, JOHNNY POPE.
     
                    JILL
          Egypt?
     
                    POPE
          That's right.
     
                    JILL
          But why Egypt?
     
                    POPE
          Well, that's where the pyramids are
          and we want real pyramids in the
          ad.
     
     Jill nods.
     
                    PRODUCER
          You seem disappointed.
     
                    JILL
          No... how long did you say?
     
                    PRODUCER
          Three weeks.
     
     Jill nods.
     
                    JILL
          Egypt?
     
     Pope, chagrined, shoots Jill a look. He's trying to get her
     the job.
     
                    PRODUCER
          Look, is there somewhere else you'd
          rather go? Maybe we can change our
          location.
     
                    JILL
          No, it's not that...
     
                    PRODUCER
          Do you have children?
     
                    JILL
          No.
     
                    PRODUCER
          Are you married?
     
                    JILL
          No.
     
                    PRODUCER
          Do you have something against
          traveling?
     
                    JILL
               (unable to interpret
               Pope's looks to her)
          No.
     
                    POPE
          Well, do you have something against
          us?
     
     Jill laughs, a little embarrassed.
     
                    JILL
          No!
     
                    PRODUCER
               (to Pope, he's wasting
               time)
          John...
     
                    POPE
               (ignoring him)
          Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
     
                    JILL
          Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
     
     She is, too, and Pope can see it.
     
                    PRODUCER
          We'll let you know tomorrow.
     
                    JILL
          Please don't misunderstand... I'd
          really like to go.
     
                    PRODUCER
               (a little sarcastic)
          Thanks for coming by.
     
     Jill is at the door. She turns back. To Pope.
     
                    JILL
          Oh. thank you.
     
                    POPE
          Sure.
     
     Jill leaves.
     
                    POPE (CONT'D)
               (shaking his head)
          This town...
     
     At the shop on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills. A FEW BARS OF
     SIMON AND GARFUNKEL'S "SOUNDS OF SILENCE" covers George
     pulling up on his bike.
     
     The street is empty of traffic except there are scores and
     scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some
     meter maids. George starts toward the shop. A pair of women
     in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop.
     They look like Medusas. They hurtle down the sidewalk as if
     they're running from something.
     Then they find their respective cars and begin pouring
     pennies into the meters. CLINK, BUZZ, CLINK, BUZZ.
     
     George looks glum. He's walking along the street. A GIRL
     stops him. She's driving by in a 3.4 Jag.
     
                    GIRL
          Hi, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, baby, what's happening?
     
                    GIRL
          Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you
          know, the guy I divorced last
          summer.
     
                    GEORGE
          Great, great. I hope you make it.
     
     Somebody HONKS in back of her.
     
                    GIRL
          Call me!
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't have your number, stop by
          the shop.
     
                    GIRL
               (waving goodbye)
          Okay!
     
     George looks after her, smiling. Then:
     
                    GEORGE
               (disgusted)
          God damn it.
     
     He goes into the shop.
     
     A large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop. It covers most
     of the wall it leans against.
     
     An attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything
     matching, a real French garden, leans forward INTO SHOT and
     looks at herself in the mirror. She studies her image
     carefully. She moves closer to it. She seems uncertain at
     first. Then as she looks her conviction grows:
     
                    TINA
          Great... great... great... great...
          great!
     
     She turns back to DENNIS LOLLY, her hairdresser. She takes
     his hand.
     
                    TINA (CONT'D)
          Great, Dennis.
     
     With her other hand she touches her hair.
     
                    TINA (CONT'D)
          Do you think there's enough height?
          I mean do you think there's enough
          height?
     
     Now she and Dennis look into the mirror at her together.
     Dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck. Felicia,
     in far corner, waits defiantly. George spots her.
     
                    TINA (CONT'D)
          George, do you think there's enough
          height?
     
                    GEORGE
               (on way to Felicia)
          Yeah, sure.
     
                    TINA
          Dennis doesn't think so.
     
                    DENNIS
          Man, I didn't say a word.
     
                    TINA
          Well, what do you think? Is there
          enough height?
     
     Both Dennis and Tina turn back to the mirror for further
     deliberation.
     
                    FELICIA
          You're late, George.
     
                    GEORGE
               (taking her to his
               cubicle)
          I gotta talk to you.
     
                    FELICIA
          I don't want to talk about it...
     
                    GEORGE
          But you don't know what happened.
     
                    FELICIA
          I don't care.
     
                    TINA
          George, do you think there's too
          much height?
     
                    GEORGE
               (seating her)
          It's great. You don't know what
          happened, this girl she almost got--
     
                    FELICIA
               (a little hysterical)
          I don't care about that girl, I
          don't care if she's dead.
     
                    GEORGE
          Calm down, baby.
     
                    FELICIA
               (calming down)
          I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm
          simply saying you have no respect
          for me, that you're incapable of
          distinguishing between me and one
          of your average Hollywood...
          mummers...
     
                    GEORGE
          -- What?
     
                    FELICIA
          Nummers.
     
                    GEORGE
          What?
     
                    FELICIA
          -- Numbers, and I don't need to
          place myself in that kind of
          position.
     
     GLORIA tugs on George's arm.
     
                    GEORGE
          What're you here for?
     
                    GLORIA
               (as if giving away a
               secret)
          -- A wash and set.
     
                    GEORGE
          No.
     
                    GLORIA
          No?
     
                    GEORGE
          You need a cut.
     
                    GLORIA
          But Mr. Norman said --
     
                    GEORGE
          Said what!
     
                    GLORIA
               (whispered)
          I just needed a wash and set, a
          wash and set, that's all.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, baby, I'm George and it needs
          to be cut.
               (to Felicia)
          But I don't want to place you in
          that position either.
     
                    FELICIA
          -- I like myself far too much, far
          too much.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't want to place you in any
          position --
     
                    FELICIA
          -- to be put in that kind of
          position...
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Gloria)
          I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
     
                    MARY
               (a schvar)
          Yeah!
     
                    GEORGE
          Wash her.
     
                    MARY
               (looking at Gloria)
          What with?
     
                    GEORGE
               (nudging her)
          -- A brillo pad, I don't care,
          anything.
     
     Mary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are
     several photographs of models and one of a handsome young
     black Marine in fatigues. George has gone to pick up a razor,
     changes it.
     
                    MARY
          -- You takin' a lot of shit lately,
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- Oh yeah.
     
                    MARY
               (mixing)
          But then again you ask for it --
          you just like my Otis -- can't keep
          his hands outta ladies' hair
          either.
     
     George laughs.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- White ladies?
     
                    MARY
               (laughing, too)
          -- Oh my yes.
     
                    FELICIA
               (burning with anger)
          George --
     
                    GEORGE
               (calling back)
          I'm coming, baby --
               (to Mary)
          How's Otis doing, anyway?
     
                    MARY
          That boy always does great. He's a
          corporal or a squad leader or
          something, just wrote me from some
          place called Kwang Due?
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know if you don't know --
     
                    FELICIA
          George!
     
     George winks at Mary, heads back.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
               (going  right on)
          I'm not used to that kind of
          treatment.
     
                    GEORGE
          What kind of treatment?
     
                    FELICIA
               (going right on)
          I've never been treated that way,
          and I'm not going to start now.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been
          cutting too much hair lately. I'm
          losing all my concepts...
     
     Jill has entered the shop. She approaches George.
     
                    JILL
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, baby, what's happening?
     
                    JILL
          They want me to go to Egypt for
          three weeks.
     
                    GEORGE
          Great.
     
     Jill stands there now, not knowing what to say.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Jill, say hello to Felicia.
     
                    JILL
          Hello.
     
                    FELICIA
          Hello.
     
                    JILL
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, baby...
     
                    JILL
          How did it go at the bank?
     
     George looks away.
     
                    GEORGE
          Great.
     
                    JILL
          Could I talk to you for a second?
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, I'm, you know --
     
                    JILL
          Could I?
     
     George moves away from Felicia.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
                    JILL
               (with some feeling)
          I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
     
                    GEORGE
          Go where?
     
                    JILL
               (impatiently)
          Egypt!
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta
          get back, okay?
     
                    JILL
          Okay, but how did it go at the
          bank?
     
                    GEORGE
          Great... can we talk later?
     
                    NORMAN
               (the shop's owner)
          George!
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
                    NORMAN
          You're late, we're all backed up
          and you're supposed to go to
          Buffums.
     
                    GEORGE
          Buffums?
     
                    NORMAN
          Yes, Buffums.
     
                    GEORGE
          I've got heads here, Norman.
     
                    NORMAN
          You promised you'd do the show.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh fuck, Norman!
     
                    NORMAN
          Don't use that tone of voice with
          me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
     
     George turns back to Felicia as RICCI comes by. He's near
     tears.
     
                    RICCI
          Do you know what that Lillian
          Bercovici just did?
     
                    GEORGE
               (working on Felicia)
          No, man.
     
                    RICCI
          -- Right after I sprayed her?
     
                    GEORGE
          What?
     
                    RICCI
               (losing control)
          She touched it! Then she played in
          it and got it all into something
          else. Now I don't know what it is!
     
     He's waiting for George for sympathy. Jill steps away
     gathering patience.
     
                    RICCI (CONT'D)
          I can't even stand to talk to her
          on the phone.
     
                    GEORGE
               (sympathetic)
          She's heavy.
               (to Felicia)
          See, Norman expects me to get in
          here, take care of all the
          customers and then do his show out
          in Norwalk. I gotta have my own
          shop, just out of self defense.
     
                    FELICIA
          I can see that.
     
                    GEORGE
          You're looking great, baby.
     
                    FELICIA
          What're you doing later?
     
                    GEORGE
               (half kidding)
          Whatever you say.
     
                    FELICIA
          We have this political thing
          tonight. Could you comb me out at
          the house?
     
     George is torn.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know. I'm beginning to feel
          guilty.
     
                    FELICIA
          What about?
     
                    GEORGE
          All I ever do is play. I should be
          doing something to get my own shop
          open.
     
                    FELICIA
          Why don't you see Lester?
     
                    GEORGE
               (a little alarmed)
          Your husband?
     
                    FELICIA
          Yes.
     
                    GEORGE
               (not sure what she's
               driving at)
          What about?
     
                    FELICIA
          The shop. I think you're a good
          investment, and I don't mind
          telling him.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
     
     Jill returns.
     
                    JILL
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
     
                    JILL
          I already said hello.
     
                    GEORGE
          Okay.
     
                    JILL
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, baby.
     
                    JILL
          When can I talk to you?
     
                    GEORGE
          Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
     
                    JILL
          I know but this is important. I
          have to make a decision.
     
                    GEORGE
          About what?
     
                    JILL
          Whether or not I'm going.
     
                    GEORGE
          Going where?
     
                    JILL
          Egypt.
     
                    GEORGE
          Honey, have they offered you the
          job?
     
                    JILL
          No, but I think they might.
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Jill)
          Just a second, I'll be right with
          you...
     
     He turns back to Felicia. Jill moves away.
     
                    FELICIA
               (interested)
          Is she all right?
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know. Just a minute...
     
     George moves over to Jill.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          What do you want?
     
                    JILL
          Your advice!
     
                    GEORGE
          They didn't offer you the job yet.
     
                    JILL
          I want your feelings about it.
     
                    GEORGE
          Right now?
     
                    JILL
          Look, either we have a meaningful
          relationship or we don't, I've got
          to know.
     
                    GEORGE
               (really harassed)
          Look, baby, can we talk about it
          later?
     
     Felicia is watching them.
     
                    JILL
          When?
     
                    GEORGE
          When I get off work.
     
                    JILL
          When is that?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll call you.
     
                    JILL
          When is that, George?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll call you.
     
                    JILL
               (really upset)
          But I never know when you're
          working and when you're not
          working!
     
                    GEORGE
               (half to himself)
          Neither do I, baby.
     
                    JILL
          What?
     
                    GEORGE
          Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
     
                    JILL
          ... Okay...
     
     Back to Felicia. As Jill leaves.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- Anyway.
     
                    FELICIA
          I hope she's all right.
     
                    GEORGE
          She's fine. You really think I'd be
          a good investment?
     
                    FELICIA
          I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, I know.
     
                    FELICIA
          And I certainly wouldn't tell
          Lester.
     
                    GEORGE
          I know.
     
                    FELICIA
          I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
     
                    GEORGE
          That's great. You look great, baby,
          great. Dennis, look at Felicia's
          hair.
     
     Dennis stops. He's with the DESK GIRL. Both of them:
     
                    DENNIS & DESK GIRL
          Great.
     
     EXT. SHOP - DAY
     
     Jill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car...
     gets in... sits for a long moment.
     
     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
     
     George on bike pulls into office building. The MUSIC OVER is
     JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S "WHITE RABBIT."
     
     INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     In his inner office.
     
     LESTER'S on the telephone, staring out the window.
     
                    LESTER
          Look, Kurt, I don't care where you
          have to go. I want Beluga Caviar
          there. Call Jurgenson's, call
          Chasen's... I don't care how much
          it costs... how much?... then spend
          it. Just make sure it's there.
          You've got all the money in the
          world to buy it. You understand?
          Just make sure it's there on the
          table tonight.
               (he hangs up)
          Jesus.
               (to George, to no one)
          You've got to do everything
          yourself. You know?
     
     Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look. It covers his
     hair, his clothes. George is acutely uncomfortable.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Felicia says you're a very good
          hairdresser.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, yeah.
     
                    LESTER
          She says you're a fabulous
          hairdresser.
     
                    GEORGE
          Thank you.
     
                    LESTER
          I didn't say it, she did. How'd you
          happen to get in that line of work?
     
     George sort of knows what Lester's driving at.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, well, I went to beauty
          school... you know you go to beauty
          school... and you get your
          operator's license... and you
          graduate... and you're a
          hairdresser.
     
                    LESTER
          I see.
     
     Long pause. George hasn't told Lester what he wants to know.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          It's an unusual trade.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yes it is.
     
     An awkward pause.
     
                    LESTER
          But the important thing is you're
          successful at it.
     
                    GEORGE
          In a way. But...
     
                    LESTER
          But what?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm better than the guy I work for.
     
     This seems to interest Lester.
     
                    LESTER
          Well, George, I invest for a lot of
          people. I make a lot of money for
          them. More than they could do for
          themselves.
     
                    GEORGE
          After a while that hurts... doesn't
          it?
     
     Lester smiles. He appreciates this.
     
                    LESTER
          It's good you want to do something,
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Thank you.
     
                    LESTER
          But personal services are not the
          kind of thing I usually get into.
     
                    GEORGE
          They're not?
     
                    LESTER
               (suddenly direct, almost
               enthusiastic)
          No, they're a pain in the ass,
          there's no way of keeping track of
          anything. It's a cash business and
          you've got to watch your operators
          or they'll steal you blind, am I
          right or am I right?
     
                    GEORGE
          You're right.
     
                    LESTER
          Who needs that kind of aggravation?
          Who needs that kind of aggravation
          at my age? When I finish work I
          want to...
     
     The door bursts open. It's one of the SECRETARIES.
     
                    SECRETARY
          Mr. Karpf...
     
     Jackie is right behind her. She bounces in, not seeing
     George.
     
                    JACKIE
          I'm sorry but I need an extra
          garage key.
     
     In Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she
     did with Jill. She's startled when she sees George.
     
                    LESTER
          What for? What do you need the key
          for?
     
     Jackie continues to stare at George.
     
                    JACKIE
          The man from Sloan's is coming. I
          called you about it.
     
                    LESTER
          How did you lose that key? Oh,
          George, this is uh Miss -- this is
          Jackie.
     
                    JACKIE
          Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
     
                    LESTER
               (a little suspiciously)
          Is that right?
     
                    JACKIE
               (almost immediately on the
               defensive)
          Well, yes, George is a wonderful
          hairdresser.
     
                    LESTER
          Is that right?
     
     Awkward pause.
     
                    JACKIE
          So how's Norman?
     
                    GEORGE
          Great. Who's been doing your hair?
     
     Jackie glances at Lester.
     
                    JACKIE
          I go to the blue'n gold barber shop
          in Westwood. The guy in the third
          chair's dynamite... nobody much.
     
                    LESTER
          George is going to open a shop.
     
                    JACKIE
               (really interested)
          No kidding? Your own shop?
     
     George starts to say yes.
     
                    LESTER
          George, could you -- excuse us for
          a minute?
     
                    GEORGE
          Sure.
     
     He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and
     Lester alone. Lester shuts the door.
     
                    LESTER
          I called to tell you I was sending
          one over but the line was busy,
          you're always on the phone.
     
                    JACKIE
          I am?
     
                    LESTER
          Who were you talking to?
     
                    JACKIE
          Who do you think I was talking to?
     
                    LESTER
          My secretary saw you with that boy.
     
                    JACKIE
          Steve?
     
                    LESTER
          Whatever his name is, that actor.
     
     Jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very
     emotional.
     
                    JACKIE
          Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
               (a touch bitter)
          Steve couldn't get arrested as an
          actor. He couldn't get arrested as
          a boy.
     
                    LESTER
          Then you were talking to him.
     
                    JACKIE
          I ran into him at the 76 station on
          little Santa Monica, what was I
          supposed to do, hide in the ladies
          room? Yes, I was talking to him.
     
     Lester's a little chagrined now but not much.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (an outburst)
          I'm always on the phone because you
          never let me see anybody, I can't
          even bring my girlfriends over to
          the house because they might run
          into you. You're driving me up the
          wall, Lester. You're even jealous
          of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have
          somebody I can talk to.
     
                    LESTER
          I'm not jealous of the dogs.
     
     Jackie looks at him in disgust.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (very positive)
          Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous
          of anybody, I just can't afford to
          get caught... off base.
     
                    JACKIE
          So I can't talk to some broken down
          actor, what do you think, I'm going
          to tell him I'm screwing Lester
          Karpf!
     
                    LESTER
          Of course not.
     
                    JACKIE
          That's not very logical, Lester.
     
     INT. OFFICE - GEORGE AND SECRETARY
     
     picking up the tail end of this.
     
                    SECRETARY
          He thinks the room is soundproofed.
          Don't tell him it's not.
     
                    GEORGE
          How come?
     
                    SECRETARY
          He'll have that awful construction
          crew back again, and they can never
          do anything right.
     
     INT. LESTER'S OFFICE
     
                    LESTER
               (trying to think of why)
          It's very logical, it's the most
          logical thing in the world. You
          wouldn't feel this confined if we
          could go out with people and have
          dinner, and a little conversation
          and so forth...
     
                    JACKIE
          Really? How about starting with
          tonight?
     
     By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this
     for months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to
     him genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the
     kind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
     
                    LESTER
          Sweetheart, I know it's rough but
          at this point -- my business
          involves handling money for some
          very touchy people, politics and so
          on... Felicia's at a very difficult
          period in her life... any divorce
          and settlement and so forth, my
          finances would have to be looked
          into.
     
     Jackie knows what he's talking about.
     
                    JACKIE
               (quietly)
          You and your touchy investors.
     
                    LESTER
               (finally)
          Look... you do well for people,
          they don't ask you to stop. Nobody
          wants you to stop making money,
          doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all
          want their share.
     
     Jackie comes over to Lester.
     
                    JACKIE
          You're lying about one thing,
          Lester.
     
                    LESTER
          What's that?
     
                    JACKIE
          You're still jealous.
     
     She's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can
     be with him. Lester smiles. He's almost benign.
     
                    LESTER
          God, you're a doll.
     
     He takes her in his arms and she responds.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (he means it)
          We'll work something out about
          tonight, I promise...
     
     INT. OFFICE - GEORGE AND SECRETARY
     
     The door opens. Jackie and Lester emerge, distinctly subdued.
     
                    LESTER
          Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key
          for the Bowmont House, would you?
     
                    ANGIE
          Yes, Mr. Karpf.
     
     Angie opens her desk and goes through some files, pulls out a
     key, puts it in an envelope and hands it to Jackie -- she's
     lightning quick about it, super efficient.
     
                    LESTER
          Well, let's go down together.
          C'mon, George, I'll walk you out.
     
     LESTER, JACKIE AND GEORGE IN HALLWAY BY ELEVATOR
     
     Jackie turns to stub out a cigarette in a standing ashtray.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (quietly)
          Felicia's really interested in the
          shop, isn't she?
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh yeah.
     
     Jackie moves back.
     
                    LESTER
               (normal tone now)
          Well, George, you may not think ten
          or fifteen grand means much to me,
          but I invest for myself and a lot
          of particular people.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh yeah? I mean I know.
     
                    LESTER
          So I'm going to want a little more
          of your thinking on the subject.
     
     The elevator doors open.
     
                    GEORGE
          When?
     
                    LESTER
          When?
     
     The doors close on the three of them.
     
     INT. ELEVATOR
     
     going down. George is looking at Lester, waiting for an
     answer.
     
                    LESTER
               (looks up slowly)
          How about tonight?
     
     Jackie looks to Lester. Lester winks at Jackie.
     
                    GEORGE
          Tonight?
     
                    LESTER
          Yeah, little election party I'm
          giving at the Bistro.
          It's a pain in the ass but -- I
          have to do it. We'll have a little
          time to talk there.
     
     The elevator stops on the third floor. A man in a suit and a
     middle-aged woman with a cane get in. They're strangers to
     each other. The elevator proceeds.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (quiet, almost solemn in
               their presence)
          -- maybe you could, on your way,
          you know, pick up Jackie here.
     
                    GEORGE
               (slowly)
          Okay.
     
     They've reached the basement and are standing as Bill the
     maintenance man, races around the cars to get to Lester's
     Rolls.
     
                    LESTER
          It's good you want to do something,
          George.
     
     George doesn't answer this time.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I wish my son knew what he wanted
          to do.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh yeah?
     
                    LESTER
          -- Anything, I don't care what it
          is, just so it's something.
     
                    GEORGE
          I know what you mean.
     
     Lester's car is backed up. The door opened for him.
     
                    LESTER
               (thoughtfully)
          Maybe he ought to go to beauty
          school. Anyway, see you tonight,
          doll, okay?
     
                    JACKIE
          Fine.
     
     Lester slips Bill a few dollars and takes off, leaving Jackie
     and George looking at each other. Jackie shakes her head.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Jesus...
     
                    GEORGE
          -- Yeah... your car down here?
     
     Jackie nods. They walk toward it.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          -- Listen, I'm supposed to take
          Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's
          really going to be pissed if I
          don't.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I
          tell her how important it is to me,
          I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know. Probably not.
     
                    JACKIE
          Jill's really great, isn't she?
     
                    GEORGE
          Great... so how's everything with
          you?
     
     They've reached Jackie's 230SL.
     
                    JACKIE
          Great, more or less.
     
     She starts to get in.
     
                    GEORGE
          How long you had this?
     
                    JACKIE
          Oh, about six weeks now... Lester --
          well, he's very sweet.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm sure.
     
                    JACKIE
          He's a very private person,
          actually.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know
          that we went together, does he?
     
     Jackie has started to get in the car several times. This
     stops her again.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- Well no. It never came up.
     
                    GEORGE
          You going to tell him?
     
                    JACKIE
               (smoothly)
          -- What for? Honey, I'll see you
          later.
     
     They kiss each other's cheeks, she gets in and takes off.
     
     EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - JILL AND JACKIE - DAY
     
     tooling along the tracks in Jackie's 230SL.
     
                    JACKIE
          Jill, you're a real sweetie pie.
          You really are.
               (she glances over at Jill)
          You're sure you don't mind?
     
                    JILL
          Don't be silly.
     
                    JACKIE
          You're really a love -- you sure?
     
                    JILL
          -- No. No really.
     
                    JACKIE
          Well, what is it, honey?
     
                    JILL
          Nothing.
     
                    JACKIE
          It must be something.
     
                    JILL
          Well, it's George.
     
                    JACKIE
          I thought you said things were
          great with George.
     
                    JILL
          Well they are. But we have
          problems. You say things are great
          with Lester. Is he going to marry
          you?
     
                    JACKIE
          We don't think marriage is
          important.
     
                    JILL
          But you have problems?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- Yeah, honey...
     
     JILL AND JACKIE
     
                    JILL
          I don't know. One minute he's up in
          the air and makes love to me five
          times a day and tells me
          everything's going to be great and
          he's getting his own shop and then
          suddenly he disappears and he won't
          even talk to me. It's driving me
          crazy.
     
     Jackie pulls away from the signal a little jerkily.
     
                    JACKIE
          Five times a day?
     
                    JILL
               (sighs, then)
          -- I guess it's all got to do with
          this shop.
     
                    JACKIE
          Really, Jill, aren't you
          exaggerating just a little? Five
          times a day?
     
                    JILL
               (embarrassed)
          Well, you know what I mean.
     
                    JACKIE
          After four years? No I don't... and
          I don't know too many girls who do.
     
                    JILL
          I'm exaggerating.
     
                    JACKIE
          How much?
     
                    JILL
               (giggling a little)
          Jackie --
     
                    JACKIE
          What?
     
     JACKIE AND JILL
     
                    JILL
               (taking a little  breath)
          Well... it's not so much the number
          of times he does it, it's... he
          does it for a long time.
     
                    JACKIE
          He does?
     
                    JILL
          Well yes -- you know that about
          George.
     
                    JACKIE
          It's been so long I don't how long?
     
                    JILL
          Quite a while... an hour, an hour
          and a half -- sometimes forty-five
          minutes -- that's quite a while,
          isn't It?
     
                    JACKIE
          I would say so, yes.
     
                    JILL
          Honey?
     
                    JACKIE
          What?
     
                    JILL
          I think you're going to hit that
          car in front of us.
     
     Jackie slams on the brakes.
     
     INT. UNEMPLOYMENT LINE - JILL AND JACKIE - DAY
     
     standing there.
     
                    JILL
          -- See, I just know that if I go to
          Egypt, well, things happen, I just
          don't know what'll happen to us, he
          just never seems to think ahead,
          does he?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- When you say forty-five minutes
          or an hour, do you mean continuous
          time? Just continually, without
          stopping?
     
                    JILL
          -- Well -- not going in and out, I
          don't mean just that. Why are you
          asking me? You went with George
          longer than I have.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- I guess I just blocked it out,
          that's all.
     
                    JILL
          C'mon.
     
                    JACKIE
          Well, there was this one time --
     
                    JILL
               (a little devilish)
          -- Yesss?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- I was in the kitchen doing the
          dishes and George was out in Long
          Beach doing a show...
     
                    JILL
               (meaning yes)
          -- uhh-huhh...
     
                    JACKIE
          -- Well it was very hot so I'd left
          the door open and the water was
          running so I didn't hear him come
          down the stairs...
     
                    JILL
          ... Mmm-hmmm.
     
     Now Jackie has begun to lose her self-consciousness and is
     into the story. A little faint edge of nervousness or
     something like it begins to take over Jill.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- He came up behind me and I was
          wiping a dish and he just... lifted
          up my skirt, and, you know, right
          there...
     
                    JILL
          Didn't you have any panties on?
     
                    JACKIE
               (remembering)
          -- He reached up and tore them.
     
                    JILL
          What did you do?
     
                    JACKIE
          Well... I just kept wiping that
          dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very
          sexy but it was.
     
                    JILL
               (faintly perturbed)
          No, it sounds very sexy -- did you
          just stay by the sink all that
          time?
     
                    JACKIE
          No, he picked me up and carried me
          out to the sundeck -- God, it was
          hot. The wood on the sundeck,
          everything.
     
     EXT. LESTER'S HOUSE - BEL AIR - AFTERNOON
     
     A gardener is riding a mower around the front lawn. There are
     three cars parked in and around the circular driveway.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - LESTER
     
     He slips into a cardigan sweater. His vanity is restricted
     entirely to how well pressed and clean everything is he
     wears.
     
     He goes out of the dressing room toward the kitchen, passing
     Lorna on the phone in the living room and Felicia at dining
     room table, hair in curlers, reading Cosmopolitan magazine.
     
                    LESTER
          Do you think George is a fairy?
     
                    FELICIA
          Who?
     
                    LESTER
          That kid... the hairdresser.
     
                    FELICIA
          Well, I don't know for sure... he's
          a hairdresser.
     
     Mona brings her coffee from kitchen.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Mona.
     
     Lester has swallowed some vitamins in the kitchen. Turns to
     her.
     
                    LESTER
          Maybe he's just a kooky guy who
          likes doing something kooky like
          that.
     
                    FELICIA
          Maybe... why do you ask?
     
                    LESTER
          I'm thinking of investing with him.
          He worries me.
     
                    FELICIA
          Why?
     
                    LESTER
          Maybe he's too flighty and
          irresponsible. That's why I asked
          if he was a fairy.
     
                    FELICIA
          I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
     
                    LESTER
               (really asking)
          You suggested it, don't you think
          it's a good idea?
     
                    FELICIA
          Yes, but... I thought...
     
                    LESTER
          What?
     
                    FELICIA
          That you were just indulging me.
     
                    LESTER
          No, doll, I listen to you. And if a
          deal loses money that's not so bad
          either if it's handled right.
     
     He gives Felicia a peck and starts out.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          He's a nice boy. I invited him
          tonight. I'm sorry he's a fairy.
     
     INT. SHOP - GEORGE AT WORK - DAY
     
     George is busy. He's working on ANJANETTE.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          You're in a good mood today,
          George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, baby. Things are great.
          Listen, there's Devra, whatta you
          want?
     
                    ANJANETTE
          Chicken salad.
     
                    GEORGE
          Chicken salad, Devra!
     
                    DEVRA
          I don't have any change.
     
                    GEORGE
          Get some at the desk.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          Anyway, you remember Harold?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, baby, how's it going?
     
     The PHONE RINGS. Norman brings it to George.
     
                    NORMAN
          George... Jackie Shawn.
     
     George seems really surprised to hear the voice on the other
     end. Anjanette looks around.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, I'd like to but I've got too
          many heads here, can't you stop by
          the shop?
               (to shampoo girl)
          Two caps, Mary, yeah, two.
               (back to phone)
          Okay, but I have to be in Bel Air
          at four...
     
     He hangs up. It RINGS again.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          Don't you think there's too much
          gold?
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Anjanette)
          It's great.
               (into phone)
          You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
     
                    ANJANETTE
          I don't know, I think...
     
                    GEORGE
               (good natured, but firm)
          Look, would you argue with your
          doctor?
     
                    ANJANETTE
          No.
     
     Ricci comes up to him ready to cry.
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Ricci)
          Hey, what's happening?
               (calling)
          Mary! Telephone.
               (to Ricci)
          What's the matter?
     
                    RICCI
               (furious)
          Wanda...
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh yeah?
     
                    RICCI
          You were supposed to handle that
          bitch, she's always asking for you,
          and she was furious you weren't
          here.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah?...
     
                    RICCI
          She's murdered her hair... you do
          something with her, I'm never going
          to touch her again.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm busy, man.
     
                    RICCI
          If I have to touch her again, I'll
          throw up!
     
                    GEORGE
               (exploding)
          Don't talk like a child. You're a
          pro, now get out there and cut!
     
     Ricci is stunned. He says under his breath, "I'll throw up"
     again and leaves. Mary, her back to George, sits holding the
     telephone to her ear.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          I thought you were in a good mood.
     
                    GEORGE
          I am... except I've gotta do
          somebody at their house.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          Don't you like her?
     
                    GEORGE
          No, it's a very groovy girl.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          Then what's the problem?
     
                    GEORGE
               (really worried)
          She's a very groovy girl. That's
          the problem.
     
                    ANJANETTE
          What're you talking about, George?
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, it's a small town. Sooner or
          later things catch up with you...
          don't they?
     
     Mary runs out of the shop, tipping over a magazine rack.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Where's the caps, Mary?
     
     She's exiting front door in a hurry.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Mary? What's goin' on, Mary?
     
     EXT. GEORGE ON HIS MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY
     
     MUSIC, THE BYRDS, "TURN, TURN, TURN."
     
     He pulls up to a rustic house. He gets his little case off
     the bike and then hesitates. He walks to the door and rings
     the bell.
     
     Jackie answers the door. She seems distracted and, at the
     same time, a little wary. Much the same, in fact, as George.
     
                    JACKIE
          Hi. C'mon in.
     
     Jackie's wearing a robe. They walk into the living room, the
     dogs yelping.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Shut up, it's all right.
               (to George, automatically)
          Do you want a drink?
     
                    GEORGE
          No, thanks.
     
                    JACKIE
          Well, I do.
     
     She starts to mix herself a drink. She changes her mind,
     pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back. She does
     it again. When she turns back to George he's looking at her
     noncommittally.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Where do you want to do this?
     
                    GEORGE
          Probably the bathroom.
     
                    JACKIE
          Can't you do it out here?
     
     George looks around.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, it depends. If you just
          wanted a combout. I guess I could.
     
     Jackie turns to him, honestly uncertain.
     
                    JACKIE
          Well, what do you think?
     
     George himself is tentative.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know. Why don't you sit
          down.
     
     Jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down
     on the glass-topped coffee table.
     
                    JACKIE
               (meaning her position)
          Is this all right?
     
     George moves in. He draws the drapes back so light comes in
     from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
     He takes her hair in his hands. The contact makes them both
     nervous. She looks away. George continues to run his hands
     through her hair.
     
                    JACKIE
               (a little nervous)
          Well, what do you think?
     
                    GEORGE
          I'd cut it...
     
                    JACKIE
          You would?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, I think so...
     
                    JACKIE
               (almost irritable)
          You don't seem very sure.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, I'm sure.
     
     There is a moment where Jackie is trying to decide whether
     she'll let George actually cut her hair.
     
                    JACKIE
               (then)
          Okay... but I want you to know one
          thing.
               (almost a threat)
          I've got to look great tonight, I
          mean I have to look great, okay?
     
                    GEORGE
          Okay.
     
     INT. FELICIA'S BEDROOM AND DRESSING ROOM - DAY
     
     Felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses.
     She seems in a hurry.
     
     She leaves the bathroom, moves quickly through the house to
     the kitchen. She passes Lorna's bedroom. LORNA is changing
     from her school clothes into a tennis dress. She watches her
     mother flash by.
     
     IN THE KITCHEN
     
     Felicia stops. She is holding a dangling pearl earring in her
     hand.
     
                    FELICIA
          Mona, Mona!
     
     MONA comes out from the laundry room. Felicia has called a
     little too loud.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
               (indicates earring)
          Have you seen the other one of
          these by any chance? I want to wear
          them tonight.
               (before Mona can answer)
          Oh... when George gets here, tell
          him to wait. I have to pick up a
          dress and I may have to have it
          fitted, but be sure...
     
     Lorna ambles into the kitchen, expressionless.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          ... to tell him to wait.
     
                    MONA
          Yes, ma'am. But I have to go to the
          market...
     
                    FELICIA
          Just be sure he doesn't leave.
     
     Felicia flashes out the door and into the carport, visible
     through the kitchen. She takes off. Lorna slowly slips a
     white swetlet onto her slender wrist.
     
     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - DAY
     
     which includes a sauna. Jackie's got on a terry-cloth robe.
     George has been wetting her hair in the basin. Her terry
     cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way.
     
                    JACKIE
          Jill's coming with us.
     
                    GEORGE
          Great.
     
                    JACKIE
          She's incredible...
               (after a moment)
          She loves you, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah... I mean great.
     
     George begins to cut. Jackie winces a little. George notices
     it.
     
                    JACKIE
          Getting my hair cut is always a
          little nerve-wracking.
     
     The cutting goes on. The bathroom is very close. George has
     begun to perspire a little as has Jackie.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          ... I don't get it done often.
     
                    GEORGE
          Whew.
     
                    JACKIE
          What's wrong?
     
                    GEORGE
          It's hot in here.
     
                    JACKIE
               (after a moment)
          It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on
          and it makes the whole bathroom
          hot.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah... wow.
     
     George stops and takes off his shirt. He's wearing a purple T
     shirt underneath. He goes back to cutting. Jackie's getting
     more and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and
     partly because of her concern over what he's doing. George on
     the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job
     at hand.
     
                    JACKIE
               (finally)
          Not too much, don't cut too much.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jackie, would you argue with your
          doctor.
     
                    JACKIE
          The shrink? Many times.
     
     George stops and looks at her. Both are perspiring freely
     now.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Bernstein... seemed to think I
          hated men.
     
                    GEORGE
          Do you? You still see him?
     
     Jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror. George gently
     pulls her back.
     
                    JACKIE
               (with some feeling)
          No.
     
                    GEORGE
          Why not?
     
     Jackie doesn't answer.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Why not?
     
                    JACKIE
          ... he tried to... uh... make it
          with me.
     
                    GEORGE
          And?
     
                    JACKIE
          And what?
     
                    GEORGE
          Did you?
     
     Jackie looks up slowly. George is still cutting, not looking
     directly at her.
     
                    JACKIE
          It was after you, baby. After you.
     
                    GEORGE
               (breathes deeply)
          Boy, that sauna is really... can't
          you turn it down or something?
     
                    JACKIE
          No... Lester likes it on all the
          time in case he wants to use it.
     
     INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - DAY
     
     Jill, alone, sits on bed. Gazes into bureau mirror, shaping
     her hair. The PHONE RINGS.
     
                    JILL
          Hello... oh hi, Johnny. Oh really?
          Thank you... Are you serious?...
          Tonight I'm busy, I... Right now?
          Oh no, you really couldn't come up
          here.
     
     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM & BATH - DAY
     
     with Jackie's hair considerably shorter. George is sitting
     now as he works, his knee wedged between her legs, working
     very close.
     
                    JACKIE
          Anyway, he offered me a silver
          cloud. At least he should give me a
          Ferrari and pay off my house and
          give me a nine carat ring or
          something...
     
                    GEORGE
               (amused)
          Did Lester know about him?
     
                    JACKIE
          There was nothing to know.
          Anyway... if I can't have love I
          have to at least have money. I have
          to have some pride I can do
          something.
     
     George has started to dry her hair. He stops. He picks up the
     scissors. Her hair is askew still so it's difficult to see
     what George has done.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (staring at the scissors,
               a warning)
          George...
     
                    GEORGE
          I just have to do one little thing.
     
                    JACKIE
          If you screw me up for tonight,
          I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll
          kill you.
     
                    GEORGE
          I won't screw you up.
     
     EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - LESTER DRIVING - DAY
     
     his dark blue Rolls Royce. He's listening to the radio, keeps
     switching to pick up fresh news reports.
     
     He turns off Sunset and heads up Coldwater Canyon.
     
     INT. JACKIE'S BATH AND BEDROOM - JACKIE AND GEORGE - DAY
     
                    JACKIE
          George... how about Felicia?
     
                    GEORGE
               (expressionless)
          What?
     
                    JACKIE
          Did you?
     
                    GEORGE
          Did I what?
     
                    JACKIE
          You know what I'm talking about.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, I don't tell.
     
                    JACKIE
               (teasing)
          Can I count on that? I just want to
          see Lester with me and that cunt in
          the same room tonight.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah?
     
                    JACKIE
          Well, did you or didn't you?
     
     George shuts the blower off. He picks up his comb for the
     final comb out.
     
                    GEORGE
          Now, baby... if I told you about
          her... then you couldn't count on
          me not telling anymore... could
          you?
     
                    JACKIE
          You did, didn't you?
     
     They're very close and Jackie's moving closer. She's
     intrigued, amused and at ease. George is trying to keep some
     distance.
     
                    GEORGE
          Baby...
     
                    JACKIE
          You did, I know you did.
     
                    GEORGE
          One of my few virtues is
          discretion.
     
                    JACKIE
          You just can't stand to miss one of
          them, can you?
     
     She's moving closer and closer, being deliberately
     provocative -- to seduce the information out of him.
     
     EXT. JACKIE'S STREET - DAY
     
     Lester pulls into it. He stops, reaches in the glove
     compartment and pulls out one of the little airline bottles
     of vodka. He pours it into a glass, drinks it. He notices
     George's bike in the driveway. Next to him on the seat is a
     prettily wrapped package.
     
     INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - JACKIE AND GEORGE - DAY
     
     George sprays her. He turns her around in the chair to face
     the mirror so she can see herself for the first time. She
     should look really different, her hair significantly shorter,
     and modishly and beautifully cut to her face.
     
     Jackie's lips part.
     
                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          George...
     
                    GEORGE
               (staring at her)
          Yeah, baby...
     
                    JACKIE
          You're a genius.
     
     Her hand automatically goes up to take his. He starts to pull
     it back.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (grabbing it, thrilled)
          You're a genius, do you know that,
          you're a genius?
     
     She turns and throws her arms around George, kissing him.
     It's too much for George. He kisses her back.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (trying to resist)
          Oh, no.
     
     George is obsessed. He wraps his arms around her and she
     responds, passionately.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Oh, no.
     
     They are grappling, pushing and pulling with each other.
     George kicks away the stool by the mirror and tries to bend
     Jackie to the rug-covered bathroom floor.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (genuine)
          No! Don't! Please!
     
                    GEORGE
               (forcing her down)
          I don't want to... I swear...
     
     She throws her arms around him, kissing him and shoving him
     away. George is tearing at his trousers. They are on the
     floor now , rolling around, bouncing gently off the ceramic
     molding from the sunken tub.
     
                    JACKIE
          It'll ruin everything.
     
                    GEORGE
          I know... you don't know, I know.
     
                    JACKIE
          Don't, don't, don't...
     
     They hit the sauna room door as they're rolling around and
     the door opens. Steam comes pouring over them, momentarily
     obscuring their struggles. George has trouble getting his
     pants down. At the last instant, Jackie gives them a helpful
     tug.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (moans)
          Oh, no...
     
     Suddenly, the DOGS begin to BARK. There is the SOUND of the
     DOOR OPENING. Jackie sits up.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          It's Lester.
     
     She's frozen with fear.
     
                    LESTER'S VOICE
               (muffled)
          Hey, doll... Jackie... honey...
          where are you?
     
                    JACKIE
          Get up, get up, get up.
     
     George is already trying to pull on his trousers. Jackie is
     up and clutching her robe, unable to move.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          Oh God, oh God, oh God... do
          something, please God, do
          something.
     
                    LESTER'S VOICE
               (nearer)
          Hey, baby, are you sleeping?
     
                    GEORGE
          Sit down.
     
                    JACKIE
               (frantic)
          What are you talking about?
     
                    GEORGE
               (equally frantic, forcing
               her)
          Sit down!
     
     WITH LESTER
     
     He's moved into the bedroom, carrying the package obviously a
     gift for Jackie. He's been a little puzzled. His puzzlement
     is rapidly turning to suspicion.
     
                    LESTER
          Jackie?... Jackie?
     
     Lester opens the door. He's hit with a blast of steam and the
     sight of George stripped to the waist, ostensibly working
     over Jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel. George has a
     comb in one hand and now turns on the dryer, blowing it with
     a somewhat exaggerated gesture.
     
                    JACKIE
          Shut the door, shut the door!
     
                    LESTER
          Oh, I'm sorry.
     
     He shuts the door. Then he thinks better of it. He opens the
     door again and takes a step into the bathroom.
     
     George waves the comb at Lester a little impatiently. It's
     wet and sprinkles Lester.
     
                    GEORGE
          Look, either come in or stay out!
     
                    JACKIE
          Shut the door, Lester. What do you
          think this is, a picnic?
     
                    LESTER
               (confused now)
          Sorry, honey, I...
     
                    GEORGE
          That's okay, that's okay, just shut
          the door.
     
     Lester shuts the door, feeling a little chagrined, and
     relieved. He sits on the bed and puts the present beside him.
     In a moment George emerges.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          ... she's very upset...
     
                    LESTER
          What about, tonight?
     
                    GEORGE
               (seizing the opportunity)
          That, and... I'll be done in a
          minute.
     
     He goes back inside.
     
     IN THE BATHROOM GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     just stare silently into mirror at each other.
     
                    LESTER'S VOICE
          Jackie?... Hey, I brought you a
          little something, doll.
     
     AT THE DOOR - LESTER AND GEORGE
     
     George has his case of comb and scissors, etc., and is
     standing with Lester. He's anxious to go.
     
                    LESTER
          You look like you've had quite a
          work-out.
     
                    GEORGE
          It's nerve wracking sometimes...
          women can get you very upset.
     
                    LESTER
          I know it, I know it.
     
                    GEORGE
          ... this doing hair it's...
     
                    LESTER
          I know it, son. But tonight's going
          to be even tougher.
     
     George just looks at him. Lester walks him to bike.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          George, I know you have to deal
          with Felicia and you're caught in
          the middle, and if you can just
          bear with me tonight, well, I
          appreciate the way you've handled
          the situation.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, hey...
     
                    LESTER
          It's a difficult situation, and I
          want you to know I appreciate it.
          Tonight's going to be real tough
          for me --
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know what to...
     
                    LESTER
          Son, we'll do business, I can tell
          you that.
     
     George roars off on bike.
     
     JACKIE AND LESTER IN KITCHEN
     
     Jackie is cleaning up some dog food. Lester stands there for
     a minute.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I'd like a drink.
     
                    JACKIE
               (looking up)
          Just a second, I've gotta clean
          this mess up or the dogs'll have it
          all over the house.
     
                    LESTER
          You ought to get rid of those dogs.
     
     Jackie looks up and then controls herself.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          They get hair all over the place.
     
                    JACKIE
          They're Yorkies and they don't
          shed.
     
     Jackie goes into the living room and fixes Lester a drink.
     Lester follows.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (giving him a drink)
          Here.
     
                    LESTER
          Aren't you going to have one?
     
                    JACKIE
          No.
     
                    LESTER
          Why not?
     
                    JACKIE
          Because I don't want one.
     
     Lester goes over to her to kiss her.
     
                    LESTER
          C'mon, doll, it's five o'clock,
          have a drink.
     
     Jackie turns away and explodes.
     
                    JACKIE
          I don't want one! First you tell me
          not to drink then you tell me to
          drink, which is it? I don't want a
          drink!
     
     Lester's now a little intimidated, but even more suspicious.
     
                    LESTER
          I called to tell you I was on my
          way, but the line was busy, you're
          always on the phone.
     
     EXT. LESTER'S HOUSE IN BEL AIR - DAY
     
     George pulls into the circular driveway. COVERED by a few
     bars of The Mama's and The Papa's "California Dreamin."
     There's only one car.
     George gets off the bike and goes to the door. Nobody
     answers. He hears the SOUND of a BALL BANGING. He looks
     toward the tennis court.
     
     ON THE COURT - LORNA
     
     is banging away on the backboard. There's a basket of balls
     nearby. She hits with considerable skill and power until she
     misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh
     surrounding the court.
     
     George is standing there. Lorna looks at him.
     
                    LORNA
          You here to see my mother?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
                    LORNA
          She's out, but you're supposed to
          wait.
     
     LORNA WALKING TO GEORGE
     
                    LORNA (CONT'D)
          Hungry?
     
                    GEORGE
          A little.
     
     AT THE KITCHEN TABLE
     
     They're eating silently. Lorna has hauled all kinds of food
     out of the refrigerators. She watches George as he eats with
     some relish. She gets up and goes to the steel-doored
     refrigerators.
     
                    LORNA
               (indicating refrigerators)
          This is the one thing I like about
          this house... want some lox?
     
                    GEORGE
          No thanks.
     
                    LORNA
          You're my mother's hairdresser?
     
                    GEORGE
               (warily)
          I do her hair, yeah.
     
                    LORNA
          Chopped liver?
     
                    GEORGE
          No thanks.
     
                    LORNA
          Are you gay?... baked apple?...
          they're cold but they're good.
     
                    GEORGE
          No thanks.
     
                    LORNA
          Did you hear me?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
     
                    LORNA
          Well, are you? Are you queer?
     
                    GEORGE
          ... yeah.
     
                    LORNA
               (laughing)
          C'mon, are you or aren't you?
     
                    GEORGE
               (trying to avoid it)
          Gee, this is great.
     
     He slices a piece of cheesecake. Lorna sits down, in the
     chair nearest him now.
     
                    LORNA
          C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
     
                    GEORGE
          Why do you wanna know so bad?
     
                    LORNA
          See if you've been making it with
          my mother.
     
                    GEORGE
               (looking at her for a
               minute, he changes his
               tone)
          What would my being a faggot have
          to do with that?
     
     Lorna shrugs.
     
                    LORNA
          Nothing, I guess... have you ever
          made it with a guy?
     
                    GEORGE
          Have you ever made it with a girl?
     
                    LORNA
          I asked you first.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
     
     Lorna smiles. A pause.
     
                    LORNA
          Well, are you?
     
                    GEORGE
          Am I what?
     
                    LORNA
          Making it with my mother?
     
     George wants to avoid this at all costs. He stares at Lorna
     intently.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'd like to do your hair sometime.
     
                    LORNA
          Why?
     
                    GEORGE
          ... just, you could look very
          heavy...
     
                    LORNA
          Don't make conversation with me.
     
                    GEORGE
          What?
     
                    LORNA
          You don't have to make conversation
          with me, I'm not my mother... do
          you have a thing about older
          women... that's sort of faggoty
          isn't it?
     
     George is weary and getting annoyed.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, it is.
     
                    LORNA
          I never get my hair done.
     
                    GEORGE
          No kidding.
     
                    LORNA
          In fact, I don't think I've ever
          been to a beauty parlor in my whole
          life.
     
                    GEORGE
          No shit.
     
                    LORNA
          You think that's funny, don't you?
     
                    GEORGE
               (laughing a little)
          Yeah.
     
                    LORNA
          You live a phony cheap cop-out
          existence.
     
                    GEORGE
               (determined to be light)
          Yeah...
     
                    LORNA
          Beverly Hills hairdresser... what
          kind of a thing is that to do...
          you might as well be a faggot...
          think that's funny too?
     
                    GEORGE
          No.
     
                    LORNA
          Then what do you think?
     
                    GEORGE
          That you're just like your mother.
     
                    LORNA
          I am not like my mother!
     
                    GEORGE
          You are.
     
                    LORNA
          I am not!
     
                    GEORGE
          You are.
     
     Lorna is furious.
     
                    LORNA
          I am not!
     
                    GEORGE
               (he starts to placate her)
          Look...
               (then defiantly)
          Do you wanna fuck me?
     
                    LORNA
               (defiantly)
          Yeah.
     
     George stops eating. He's not prepared for this.
     
                    GEORGE
               (uneasily)
          Right now?
     
                    LORNA
               (a little more tentative
               now that the moment has
               arrived)
          Yeah.
     
     EXT. SOURCE RESTAURANT - JOHNNY POPE AND JILL - DAY
     
     A scraggly bearded WAITER with long stringy hair sets down
     two huge green salads before Jill and Johnny Pope.
     
     In so doing the Waiter drops a wooden menu he's been
     carrying. As he bends down to pick it up, he kneels beside
     Pope. Pope taps him on the shoulder.
     
                    POPE
               (tapping him)
          Oh, scraves...
     
                    WAITER
          Yes?
     
     The Waiter looks up, and moves.
     
                    POPE
          Thank you.
     
                    WAITER
          What for?
     
                    POPE
          Taking your hair out of my salad.
     
                    WAITER
          Oh, I'm sorry.
     
     Pope nods, Jill giggles. The Waiter goes off. Pope tosses out
     a few pieces of lettuce from the top of his salad.
     
                    JILL
          Why don't you ask for another one?
     
                    POPE
          Are you kidding? His hair's
          probably the most nutritious thing
          in here. See, you've reduced me to
          eating weeds.
     
                    JILL
          ... my friend doesn't like it here
          either.
     
                    POPE
          All right, forget this filth.
          Continue about your friend.
     
                    JILL
          Well he's not exactly a friend.
     
                    POPE
          Is he an enemy?
     
                    JILL
               (laughing)
          Of course not... he's sort of a
          boyfriend.
     
                    POPE
          -- sort of a boyfriend?
     
                    JILL
          Sort of.
     
                    POPE
          I see. You mean he just sort of
          fucks you.
     
                    JILL
          Johnny!
     
                    POPE
          My God, did I say that? I don't
          believe it.
     
     He looks under his chair to see if it was somebody else.
     
                    POPE (CONT'D)
          I'm terribly sorry.
     
                    JILL
               (amused)
          -- never mind.
     
                    POPE
          What does he do? Is he an actor?
     
                    JILL
          -- no.
     
                    POPE
          Good for you.
     
                    JILL
          He's a hairdresser.
     
     Pope drops his fork in the salad bowl.
     
                    POPE
          -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How...
          how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
     
                    JILL
          Getting your hair done...
               (looks at him, abruptly)
          Would you like to go to a party?
     
                    POPE
          Not with your hairdresser.
     
     EXT. LESTER'S HOUSE - FELICIA - DAY
     
     pulls into the driveway. She gets out of her car, spots
     George's bike.
     
     INT. THE KITCHEN
     
     She sees the food spread out.
     
     FELICIA
     
     moving through the house. She stops by Lorna's room. Lorna
     has a sliding door, which is closed. Felicia opens it.
     
                    FELICIA
          Lorna?
     
     LORNA'S BEDROOM
     
     Lorna is sitting on her bed, in her tennis dress but with her
     tennis shoes off. She's straightening a string in her racket.
     She looks to her mother, expressionless.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Have you seen George?
     
                    LORNA
          He's in the bathroom.
     
                    FELICIA
          Your bathroom?
     
                    LORNA
          Yes.
     
     The toilet flushes. The sink runs, and George emerges. He's
     looking a little haggard.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hi.
     
                    FELICIA
               (coolly)
          Hello, George.
     
     They walk out to the lanai together and George picks up his
     case. There is considerable tension from Felicia as they walk
     into her bedroom. Felicia slides the bedroom door shut, an
     action which George unhappily notices. She turns to George.
     She looks very hostile. She's trembling.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          I've missed you.
     
     George is taken aback. He gropes for a moment.
     
                    GEORGE
          I've... missed you too.
     
     Felicia comes to him. She comes to him and touches his arm.
     George suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds
     his fist into a high-backed chair, turning away from Felicia.
     She clearly misunderstands the action.
     
                    FELICIA
               (touched)
          It's okay, honey... it's okay now.
     
     She moves to the door and quietly locks it. George winces.
     She comes back to him and kisses him gently. She kisses him
     again with more passion. George tries to respond.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          Comb my hair out later, honey.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
     
                    FELICIA
          No, baby... I'm glad you're coming
          tonight.
     
     She gently tugs at him, leading him toward the bed. George is
     miserable.
     
                    GEORGE
               (looking toward the door)
          But aren't you...
     
                    FELICIA
          Right now, I just don't care.
     
     As they sink to the bed, Felicia switches on the HI-FI. The
     Tijuana Brass begin to play.
     
     GEORGE ON HIS BIKE - LATE AFTERNOON
     
     COVERED BY a few bars of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone".
     
     Riding home. He turns down his street and pulls into his
     driveway. He gets off his bike and only as he starts up his
     walk does he see Jill. She's been quietly waiting on his
     front porch, hidden in the shadows of the overhang. She
     doesn't look happy. George stops cold.
     
                    GEORGE
               (?)
          Jill says nothing.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Where's your car?
     
                    JILL
          A friend dropped me off.
     
                    GEORGE
          Who?
     
                    JILL
          Never mind. Where've you been?
     
                    GEORGE
          A business meeting, I told you
          that.
     
     They go inside. The living room is messy. George looks around
     in disgust.
     
                    JILL
          What business meeting?
     
                    GEORGE
          Look at the way I live.
     
                    JILL
          I've been trying to reach you all
          afternoon. You weren't in the shop.
          What is this thing tonight?
     
                    GEORGE
          What do you mean, what is it? It's
          some political bullshit.
     
                    JILL
          I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't
          you think you could call me and let
          me know? Look at my hair.
     
                    GEORGE
          Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you
          think I want to go to some God
          damned party? I'm trying to get
          that God damned shop open. I'm
          trying to get a little bread
          together. That's all I'm doing.
     
     George's outburst has shocked Jill. George maniacally begins
     straightening the mess.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I just wanna live like everybody
          else, that's all. I want clothes in
          the closet, and food in the
          refrigerator, and I don't want shit
          all over the house and running my
          ass all over town... I want my own
          house... I want an appointment
          book... I want to get up in the
          morning and go to bed at night... I
          want a normal life like everybody
          else, that's all.
     
     He collapses into a chair. She comes over to him and knee
     beside him.
     
                    JILL
          I know, honey.
     
                    GEORGE
          Maybe I should get a dog... no, it
          would just shit all over the house
          and I'd never clean it up.
     
                    JILL
               (laughing a little,
               touching him)
          Oh, honey. If we had one place, we
          could have a nicer place and I
          could take care of it. We're almost
          never here.
     
     REAR VIEW MIRROR - NIGHT
     
     A signal red Porsche cabriolet pulls up into mirror. The top
     is down. Under the brightly lit streetlights Jill's blonde
     hair and features are VISIBLE.
     
     WITH GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     in her Mercedes. George still looking through the rear view
     mirror. Jackie's a knockout.
     
                    JACKIE
               (looking at George looking
               in mirror)
          -- you'll be the prettiest thing in
          the room -- light's green...
     
                    GEORGE
               (he takes off)
          -- oh yeah... what do you know
          about this guy?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- what guy?
     
                    GEORGE
               (gesturing toward rear
               window)
          -- this guy with Jill.
     
                    JACKIE
          He's a director.
     
     OUTSIDE OF BISTRO - GEORGE AND JOHNNY POPE - NIGHT
     
     pull up, Pope right behind George. Parking ATTENDANTS leap
     for the doors.
     
     A few photographers of the movie freak variety ask each other
     who these arrivals are. One assures several others that
     they're nobody.
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Attendant)
          Do I need a ticket for this?
     
                    ATTENDANT
          We'll remember you.
     
                    POPE
          as they move to take his Porsche.
     
                    POPE (CONT'D)
               (shaking his head)
          I'll park it.
     
     Pope drives his own car onto the lot.
     
     WITH JILL, GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     waiting for Pope who is now ambling toward them.
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Jill)
          What does he direct besides
          traffic?
     
                    JILL
          Ha, ha.
     
                    GEORGE
          Television or movies?
     
                    JILL
          Commercials.
     
                    JACKIE
               (quietly, to George)
          Feel better? Let's go.
     
     Pope has joined them.
     
     INT. BISTRO FOYER
     
     They clear it to see the long elegant bar, bathed in soft
     light, filled with elegant customers.
     
     George looks and sees someone. A fortyish WOMAN, attractive.
     
                    GEORGE
               (to Jackie)
          Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern.
          Look at her hair.
     
                    JACKIE
          What about it?
     
                    GEORGE
          Looks like somebody took a dump in
          it, that's the worst color job I've
          --
     
     Norma comes over, hugs George.
     
                    NORMA
          George --
     
                    GEORGE
               (pointing to her hair)
          Baby, you've been chippying on me --
     
                    NORMA
          Yes, isn't it awful --
     
                    GEORGE
               (smiling)
          -- yes.
     
     Jackie tugs him by the arm.
     
                    JACKIE
          We're upstairs, George. Now come
          on. Behave yourself, and for
          Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't
          let me drink too much.
     
                    GEORGE
               (going upstairs)
          You don't do that anymore, do you?
     
     BISTRO STAIRS
     
     Jackie doesn't answer. They've reached the top of the stairs.
     
     They're hit by the full force of the upstairs gathering --
     black tie, posters of Nixon, Agnew, Reagan, and Murphy,
     vaguely familiar faces crossing back and forth, clustering,
     watching early returns on television sets that are blaring
     from various points around the room. An ORCHESTRA PLAYS Meyer
     Davis Society Jazz. Jackie and George hesitate. Pope and Jill
     are behind them. Pope jostles George as he stops, abruptly.
     George looks around. Pope smiles. He's holding Jill's hand.
     George notices. Jill disengages her hand casually, as though
     it were necessary only for the walk up the stairs. Jackie
     nudges George, forcing him to move into the room with her as
     Lester comes toward them. He's stopped on his way over.
     
                    WAITER
          Can I get you folks something?
     
                    JILL
          A stinger, please.
     
                    POPE
          A tomato juice.
     
                    GEORGE
          I'll take a -- some white wine.
     
                    WAITER
          And you, madam?
     
                    JACKIE
               (searching the room)
          Oh I'll uhh -- just a coke.
     
     The Waiter moves on and they wait for their drinks.
     
     Lester finally makes to them.
     
                    LESTER
          George, glad you could make it,
          son. Hi, doll.
     
                    JACKIE
          Lester, this is my friend Jill and
          this is Johnny Pope.
     
                    LESTER
          Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
     
     INT. BISTRO UPSTAIRS
     
     George turns to get his drink from the Waiter as do Jill and
     Pope. Lester takes Jackie's arm.
     
                    LESTER
          Who are they?
     
                    JACKIE
               (quickly)
          Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told
          you about Jill a hundred times,
          Lester, you never remember anything
          I say.
     
                    LESTER
          Does she know about us?
     
                    JACKIE
          Jesus, she's my best friend.
     
                    LESTER
          Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
     
                    JACKIE
          I don't know. Why don't you ask
          him?
     
                    LESTER
          C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying --
          George --
     
     He draws George aside.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          -- do me a favor, kind of keep your
          eye on Jackie, she's a little high
          strung tonight --
     
                    GEORGE
          -- yeah?
     
                    LESTER
          See she doesn't drink too much.
     
     Jackie has heard this last. Lester turns to her.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          See you later, doll.
     
     Jackie puts down her coke, picks up a glass of white wine
     from a passing tray and downs it in one gulp, putting it on
     another tray and picking up another glass of white wine.
     
     FELICIA
     
     with cleavage carefully prominent in a strapless gown, spots
     George. She excuses herself from the couple she has been
     talking with and goes straight to the powder room.
     
     INT. POWDER ROOM - FELICIA
     
     checks herself out in the mirror, glossing her lips with a
     pale tint of something or other. She gives a final anxious
     look, then hurries out, nearly bumping into a lady coming In.
     
     OUTSIDE
     
     she moves through the crowd up behind George, turning him
     around.
     
                    FELICIA
          George, darling.
     
     She kisses him full on the lips, lingering on it.
     
                    GEORGE
               (without batting an eye)
          Hey, baby, what's happening. Oh
          this is Jackie. Jackie, say hello
          to Felicia.
     
     It is only now that Felicia sees one of George's arms has
     been holding onto Jackie.
     
                    JACKIE
               (also without batting an
               eye)
          Hello, Felicia.
     
                    FELICIA
               (instantly suspicious of
               George)
          ... hello.
     
     Felicia looks from George to Jackie and back again.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          I'm so glad you could make it. I've
          been looking forward to seeing you.
     
     LESTER
     
     pours his drink on the cuff of a distinguished MAN sitting
     beneath him at a table as he sees George and Felicia and
     Jackie clustered together.
     
     WITH LESTER AND MAN
     
                    MAN
          Lester, what the fuck do you think
          you're doing?
     
                    LESTER
          Jesus, Nate, I'm sorry.
     
     Lester fumbles, tries to clean Nate off with a napkin.
     
                    NATE
          Never mind, I'll do it myself.
     
     He dips the napkin into a glass of ice water and proceeds to
     clean off his cuff.
     
     Nate goes back to the TV monitor where Agnew is making some
     remarks or commentators are repeating his comment about being
     a household word.
     
                    LESTER
          So far so good.
     
                    NATE
          Aw there's nothing to worry about.
     
                    LESTER
          You never know.
     
     FELICIA WITH GEORGE
     
                    FELICIA
          Why didn't you come alone? Lester
          invited you. Did you have to bring
          her?
     
                    GEORGE
               (looking toward Lester)
          Well she...
     
                    FELICIA
          She what?
     
                    GEORGE
          She's a friend of Jill's.
     
                    FELICIA
          And who's Jill?
     
     She spots Jill.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, she's a friend of Johnny
          Pope's -- you know, the director.
     
     She looks at Pope who is saying something to Jill which is
     making her laugh.
     
                    FELICIA
          Oh.
     
     GEORGE
     
     is threading his way through a crowd, holding two drinks, one
     of them a coca-cola. It's a little more raucous now, with
     
     election returns from the television sets creating a more
     festive mood. Now and then someone jumps up from a set and
     hugs someone so carrying drinks is a little dodgy.
     
     JACKIE, F.G. - LESTER, B.G., TALKING
     
     Jackie sits alone by the bar, an unlit cigarette in her
     mouth. A man offers her a match. She stares at the burning
     match as if it's obscene. She blows it out.
     
                    JACKIE
          No thanks.
     
     The man looks a little shocked, moves on.
     
     GEORGE
     
     has his arm held. It's KENNETH, a red-haired decorator.
     
                    KENNETH
          Excuse me, I know I know you, but I
          can't think where.
     
                    GEORGE
          Look, I'd like to help but --
     
     Felicia grabs George's other arm pulling him away from
     Kenneth. Kenneth looks a little shocked at the ferocity of
     Felicia's move.
     
                    FELICIA
          There you are.
     
     She tugs him with her.
     
                    GEORGE
          Wait a minute --
     
     She takes him right into the ladies room, George still
     juggling the drinks.
     
     JOHNNY POPE
     
     watches Felicia and George disappear into the ladies room,
     looking over Jill's shoulder. Jill has not seen it.
     
                    POPE
          This other couple that we're here
          with, do you know them very well?
     
                    JILL
          Well... sure...
     
                    POPE
          Then maybe you can tell me why
          George would be going into the
          ladies room.
     
     Jill looks around and stares at the door.
     
                    JILL
          George? Was he alone?
     
                    POPE
          I don't think so.
     
                    JILL
          Well did he go in there with
          Jackie?
     
     Pope points over to Jackie sitting at the bar drinking now.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
          That bastard.
     
                    POPE
          George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
     
     Jill doesn't answer.
     
     INT. BATHROOM - FELICIA AND GEORGE
     
                    GEORGE
               (desperate)
          Baby, you gotta let me out of here.
     
     Felicia kisses him.
     
                    FELICIA
          Sweetheart, it's a bore out
          there... let's lock the door.
     
                    GEORGE
          Holy Christ. You want to get us
          killed?
     
                    FELICIA
          Don't be silly. I'll just tell
          Lester we were smoking a couple of
          joints. See?
     
     She pulls two joints out of her beaded bag.
     
     LESTER
     
     only a few seats from Jackie, Jackie staring daggers at him,
     Lester aware of it. He's talking to a pair of lacquered
     eminence grises.
     
                    LESTER
          -- fellas, fellas, just listen, you
          both have tidelands, you both want
          Uncle Sam to come through with
          offshore drilling permits -- so do
          it together --
     
     JACKIE
     
     has taken an olive from an olive tray and hit Lester on the
     back of the head. He's finished this little dissertation. He
     sees the source of the missile. He grows pale, frozen.
     
     Sixty-four year old bejeweled WOMAN in b.g.
     
                    WOMAN
          So, little red riding hood says 'my
          what big teeth you have and the
          wolf says all the better to eat you
          with, my dear, and she says -- eat,
          eat, eat, doesn't anybody ever fuck
          any more?'
     
     Jackie has now picked up a carrot from a relish tray. George
     appears.
     
                    GEORGE
          Don't do it.
     
                    JACKIE
          That son of a bitch, everything he
          says is a phony piece of shit, what
          does he think, I'm some cigar butt
          he's got between his teeth --
     
                    GEORGE
               (almost picking her up)
          C'mon, cunt, you're going for a
          walk.
     
     He takes her into the next room and Lester watches the move
     with a mixture of relief and concern.
     
     INT. OTHER BAR
     
     Jackie is now near tears.
     
                    JACKIE
          He just completely ignores me. He
          could have at least said something,
          introduced me or something.
     
     INT. SMALL BAR
     
                    GEORGE
          Sweetheart, you're drunk.
     
     She leans on George.
     
                    JACKIE
          Oh God, what do I want, George?
     
     Lester comes hurrying in, sweating, now.
     
                    LESTER
          Hi, doll, what's wrong?
     
                    JACKIE
          You know what's wrong.
     
     Felicia trips coming into the small bar.
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester --
     
     Lester straightens up like he's been shot.
     
                    LESTER
          Oh, Felicia, there you are, you
          know George and uh -- uh --
     
     He's genuinely forgotten her name.
     
                    JACKIE
          Jackie Shawn.
     
                    LESTER
          Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi --
          Felicia.
     
                    FELICIA
          We've met.
     
                    JACKIE
          Yes.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well anyway...
     
                    LESTER
               (to Felicia)
          Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
     
                    FELICIA
          That's George.
     
     INT. SMALL BAR
     
                    LESTER
          It's just -- fabulous.
               (to George, an attempt at
               levity)
          Think you could do anything for me?
     
                    GEORGE
               (he takes it seriously)
          Well -- I could try. Do you wash
          your hair every day?
     
                    LESTER
          Isn't that bad for it?
     
                    GEORGE
          No it keeps the skin peeling.
          You've got to keep the follicles
          open. You lose hair and the skin
          grows over the follicle and that's
          how you lose it.
     
     George actually touches Lester's hair, professional interest
     growing.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          This really ought to be layered...
     
                    LESTER
          Layered?
     
                    GEORGE
          Well yeah, otherwise it just sort,
          you know, lies there -- layer so it
          kind of fluffs out --
     
     He starts to fluff Lester's hair a little when Johnny Pope
     walks in with Jill to this. Pope stares at them.
     
                    POPE
          I think they're waiting for
          somebody to start dinner.
     
                    LESTER
          Have they sat down?
     
                    POPE
          Everybody but us.
     
                    FELICIA
          They're waiting for you, Lester.
     
     INT. BISTRO DINNER TABLE
     
     Dinner is pretty much finished, waiters have begun picking up
     plates.
     
                    IZZY SOKOLOFF
               (to Jill)
          I guess it's almost impossible to
          get work in the business these
          days.
     
     Pope watches Sokoloff make his move.
     
                    JILL
          Well, commercials. I read for a
          soap the other day.
     
                    IZZY
          A soap?
     
                    JILL
          A daytime soap opera.
     
                    IZZY
          And?
     
                    JILL
          I was too old.
     
                    IZZY
          What was it, somebody's daughter?
     
                    JILL
          Somebody's mother.
     
     JACKIE'S PLATE
     
     is untouched. She holds up her wine glass.
     
                    JACKIE
          Waiter!
     
     George looks at her.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          One word out of you and I'll gargle
          with it.
     
     The waiter pours the wine. George looks to Jill, shrugs. Jill
     mouthes, 'try and stop her.' George mouthes back, 'are you
     kidding?'
     
     INT. BISTRO
     
     SID ROTH has been eyeing Jackie.
     
                    SID ROTH
          Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn?
     
     Jackie looks at Roth. Roth shoots his cuffs and smiles.
     
                    JACKIE
          Not for rubber chicken, no.
     
     Sid Roth smiles. Jackie smiles back.
     
                    SID ROTH
               (intime)
          Well maybe I can get you something.
     
                    JACKIE
          That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
     
                    SID ROTH
          Sid.
     
                    JACKIE
          Sid. You must be a very important
          executive.
     
                    SID ROTH
               (almost a whisper)
          Well, whatever I am, I think I can
          get you whatever you'd like.
     
                    JACKIE
          You do?
     
                    SID ROTH
          Yes.
     
                    JACKIE
               (same tone as Sid's)
          -- well, more than anything else --
               (indicating George)
          -- I'd like to suck his cock.
     
     She points to George. George chokes on the last of a piece of
     chicken. Sid Roth is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
     George is coughing badly. Jackie slaps his back.
     
     HEAD TABLE - FELICIA AND LESTER
     
     Felicia is listening to Lester. The Agnew and Nixon posters
     are directly behind them.
     
                    LESTER
               (to East)
          -- Senator, you should've seen
          those little kids! About forty of
          'em, all blind. We put out these
          mattresses on the front lawn and
          they came running out of the house,
          tripping and falling all over the
          place, having a hell of a good
          time. I mean they were blind of
          course. But it really gave you a
          feeling of accomplishment. I tell
          you I never had such a good time.
     
     Felicia during the above has looked up to see Jackie fawning
     over George. She can't believe her eyes.
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester --
     
                    SENATOR
          -- let me understand this was
          exclusively a home for blind
          children --
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester --
     
                    LESTER
          -- yes, Senator -- just a minute,
          dear --
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester, don't you think that uhh --
     
     Now Lester spots it. He's very confused.
     
                    FELICIA (CONT'D)
          That girl's making an awful
          spectacle of herself.
     
                    LESTER
               (angry himself)
          What do you expect me to do about
          it?
     
                    FELICIA
          I just thought you'd like to know --
     
                    LESTER
          Why would I like to know if there's
          nothing I can do about it,
          goddammit --
     
                    OTHER VOICE
          Quiet! Cranston's on.
     
     They quiet down.
     
     JACKIE AND GEORGE
     
     Jackie's now moving around kissing George on the mouth.
     
     Jill is watching. Johnny Pope is fascinated.
     
                    JILL
          -- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
     
                    POPE
          -- oh I don't know --
     
                    JACKIE
               (arm around George's
               shoulders tonguing his
               ear)
          -- Just get me out of here, baby. I
          can't stand it. It's killing me.
     
                    GEORGE
               (indicating head table)
          -- we can't now.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- why not? C'mon, take me out of
          here, somewhere I don't have to lie
          to anybody and I'll fuck your
          brains out, you little fiend, I
          adore you --
     
     FELICIA
     
     is watching Jackie and George with ever greater intensity,
     her mouth growing more and more agape.
     
     JACKIE AND GEORGE
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
               (plaintive)
          -- don't you want to --
     
                    GEORGE
          Jackie, can we --
     
                    JACKIE
               (a little louder)
          Who's the greatest cocksucker in
          the world? C'mon --
     
     George looks around sweating now.
     
                    GEORGE
               (very quietly)
          -- you are.
     
                    JACKIE
          Fuckin' A --
     
     With that she slips right under the table. It's a
     surprisingly fluid move.
     
     FELICIA
     
     almost simultaneously rises, knocking her chair back.
     
     LESTER
     
     sees both moves and interrupts the Senator.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Senator, excuse me a moment --
     
     He turns to Felicia and then looks over toward Jackie's empty
     chair and literally doesn't know which way to go first. He's
     a little like the bear in the penny arcade that is shot and
     keeps turning one way, then another. Finally he heads toward
     Jackie's vacant chair and George.
     
     GEORGE
     
     his chin to the tablecloth is fishing under it for Jackie.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Now, Jackie --
     
                    JILL
               (trying for aplomb)
          -- she's a very compulsive girl.
     
                    POPE
          I can see that. 
     
     Lester rushes up.
     
                    LESTER
               (a desperate smile)
          Hello, George. Your friend feeling
          a little under the weather?
     
     Jackie surfaces through the tablecloth.
     
                    JACKIE
               (to Lester)
          -- you phony asshole --
     
                    LESTER
               (as if he didn't hear it)
          Oh, dear that's too bad.
               (with quiet desperation,
               to George)
          -- get her out of here, get her out
          of here.
     
     A cheer goes up as some late returns come in. Dirksen is
     talking about a new mandate for law and order and peace with
     honor.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (to Sid)
          What was that?
     
                    SID ROTH
          Illinois.
     
                    LESTER
               (doesn't know what he's
               saying)
          -- oh, good.
     
     INT. BISTRO
     
     Lester glances back toward Felicia who is watching him.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jackie, c'mon --
     
     George moves to Jill.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I've got to get her out of here.
     
                    JILL
          -- go ahead.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- well aren't you --
     
                    JILL
          -- what?
               (indicating Pope)
          -- I'll see you later...
     
                    GEORGE
               (not liking it too much)
          -- okay --
               (pointed)
          -- I'll see you later. Your house.
     
     He moves away with Jackie. Lester turns back toward the main
     table.
     
     INT. 230SL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT
     
     driving down Sunset Boulevard. There is a long moment of
     silence. The RADIO'S PLAYING the Eve of Destruction. George
     gives Jackie a couple of sidelong glances.
     
                    JACKIE
               (finally)
          -- gee...
     
                    GEORGE
          -- what?
     
                    JACKIE
               (she sits up, lights a
               cigarette)
          I don't know what gets into me.
     
                    GEORGE
          You were great.
     
                    JACKIE
          No, I blew it, I blew it with
          Lester.
     
                    GEORGE
          No you didn't.
     
                    JACKIE
          You don't think so? I do.
     
                    GEORGE
          You were great.
     
                    JACKIE
          You always say that... I really
          care for Lester, don't I?
     
     George laughs.
     
                    GEORGE
          That sounds like me.
     
                    JACKIE
          I am you, you little bastard.
     
     She starts to scrunch over and kiss him, then stops.
     
                    JACKIE(CONT'D)
          Where do you want to go?
     
                    GEORGE
          Sammy's?
     
                    JACKIE
          He still having parties?
     
                    GEORGE
          He never stopped.
     
     INT. BISTRO - FELICIA IS SITTING WITH LESTER
     
     fuming. A woman, ROSALIND, is painstakingly and painfully
     introducing the Senator.
     
                    ROSALIND
          ... and so... to have this man...
          here... among us... who has
          helped... as has everyone here to
          bring so many people together... of
          all races, creeds, and colors...
     
     FELICIA AND LESTER
     
     Rosalind droning on, b.g. She finally introduces Senator
     East.
     
     INT. BISTRO - FELICIA AND LESTER
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester.
     
                    LESTER
          Yes, sweetheart, shh.
     
     He pats her hand. She gives him a look that could kill.
     
                    FELICIA
          -- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
     
                    LESTER
          -- what, who? Oh she's very nice,
          yes -- I mean normally ---
     
                    FELICIA
          -- cause she's going to be very,
          very expensive.
     
                    LESTER
          Can't we go into this later,
          sweetheart?
     
                    ROSALIND'S VOICE
          Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator
          Joe East.
     
     Glasses are raised, a little dissonant hurrah.
     
                    FELICIA
          We cannot go into this later.
     
                    LESTER
          That's okay too.
     
                    FELICIA
          You make me sick. Just be straight
          for once in your life.
     
     There are now O.S. calls for East to do his Indian chant.
     
                                        QUICK CUT TO:
     
     EAST
     
                    SENATOR
          -- this tells of the ancient
          grandmother who, upon seeing the
          garden gate of her childhood, stops
          a moment and says, hello garden
          gate, hello garden gate, garden
          gate, hello.
     
     INT. BISTRO - LESTER AND FELICIA
     
                    LESTER
               (finally exasperated)
          -- look, Felicia, this party
          involves more than you and me, you
          know. These people are concerned
          about more than each other, you
          know.
     
                    FELICIA
          -- is that right?
     
                    LESTER
          -- yes, we're all trying to do
          something to make this a better
          country to live in, believe it or
          not.
     
     THE SENATOR
     
     has begun his weird chant, beating out accompaniment on a
     cigar box and a pewter vase.
     
                    FELICIA
               (glancing up)
          -- is that what this is all about?
     
                    LESTER
          Yes and you don't have to be
          sarcastic about it, that's a
          beautiful thing he's doing -- some
          people do more than go to the
          beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
     
                    FELICIA
          Lester, you're a miserable man.
          You're not helping anybody. You're
          just twisting arms to raise money
          for a lot of silly son of a bitches
          that are out for themselves -- this
          is just business, don't kid
          yourself. And you know the worst
          thing about it, even if it does
          somebody some good somewhere which
          I can't possibly imagine, you'll
          never know the difference. You're
          just sweating and kidding yourself 
          - and you're kidding yourself if
          you think your new business partner
          is going to keep his hands off that
          girl -- or that she'll keep her
          hands off him.
     
                    LESTER
               (he turns like a shot)
          What are you talking about?
     
     INT. BISTRO - LESTER AND FELICIA
     
                    FELICIA
               (she laughs)
          -- think what you have time to
          think, Lester.
     
     Lester grabs her.
     
                    LESTER
          What are you talking about,
          Felicia?
     
     Suddenly there's a rumble in the room and East has stopped
     chanting. Several men have stepped to the center of the room.
     One of them in a slate suit raising both hands.
     
                    DET. YOUNGER
          Excuse me, Senator. Ladies and
          gentlemen, we're going to have to
          evacuate this room as quietly and
          quickly as possible. There's
          nothing to worry about. We'd like
          you to exit through the door here
          on my left... down the steps into
          the street, please!
     
     There are whisperings and rumblings of 'a bomb' and
     rejoinders to the effect that it's a hoax. Nevertheless the
     exodus begins and grows to bedlam. Waiters who had been
     fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing
     them down the stairs, even going over them to make the
     entrance.
     
     OUTSIDE
     
     the emergency doesn't keep autograph hounds from inhibiting
     the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that
     flows onto the street. Jill and Johnny Pope are caught up in
     the swirl of the crowd. Pope temporarily loses Jill. He looks
     around. Jill taps him on the shoulder.
     
                    JILL
          -- here I am. Now what?
     
     Pope turns.
     
                    POPE
          Well -- as I see it we've got two
          choices. We can hang around here
          and wait for the bomb to go off, or
          we can go to my party.
     
                    JILL
          Let's do that.
     
     Lester is with some security people, trying to find out what
     they're doing.
     
     B.G. are several police cars, a fire truck, and the fire
     truck ambulance. Lights are flashing.
     
                    LESTER
          -- have they located it?
     
     Somebody shrugs. A CAR HONKS. Lester is pulled to the side.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (looking toward driver)
          -- oh, sorry.
     
     Then he sees it's Felicia. She gives him the finger, and lays
     rubber nearly sideswiping him.
     
                    ONE OF THE SECURITY MEN
          What was that all about?
     
     Somebody else says 'who was that?' Lester shrugs.
     
     INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     are dancing to a tape of 'Good Vibrations.' George's coat is
     off, his tie loose. They are near the entryway and sitting on
     a large staircase b.g. a young girl can be SEEN breast
     feeding her baby.
     
     George and Jackie are obviously enjoying themselves. The tape
     ends. George's silk shirt is clinging down the center of his
     back.
     
     He moves with Jackie, where she picks up a coke at the bar.
     
     A black in a caftan with a huge Afro offers Jackie a joint.
     She takes a drags, she and George move outside the living
     room. As they walk she hands the joint to George who hands
     the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the
     door -- all without really losing stride.
     
     OUTSIDE SAMMY'S - NIGHT
     
     There's a long rolling lawn. The lights are soft coming from
     the living room, the MUSIC more muted. Jackie, nevertheless,
     is breathing rather heavily from the dancing. George is
     looking at her intently, too intently for her not to notice.
     She appears not to notice.
     
                    GEORGE
          What are you looking at?
     
                    JACKIE
          The lawn -- it looks like it goes
          on forever, doesn't it?
     
     She turns back to George.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- yeah.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- look, you don't have to
          entertain me...
     
                    GEORGE
               (a slight laugh)
          Am I entertaining you?
     
                    JACKIE
          We're friends.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- sure.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- well, if you feel like playing,
          go play...
     
     Jackie looks past George into the living room.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          -- there's a lot of players in
          there --
     
     The TWINS come up behind George, and Jackie, grabbing George.
     The move should be a little startling almost as if it were an
     attack.
     
                    TWIN ONE
          George!
     
                    TWIN TWO
          George!
     
     They grab George and spin him around, temporarily pushing
     Jackie OUT OF SHOT.
     
                    GEORGE
               (pleasantly)
          Hey, what's happening.
     
                    TWIN ONE
          We're going to the jacuzzi.
     
                    TWIN TWO
          Right now.
     
                    TWIN ONE
               (tugging)
          C'mon with us --
     
                    GEORGE
          In the jacuzzi?
     
                    TWIN TWO
          Sure, why not?
     
                    TWIN ONE
          Come on, George --
     
                    GEORGE
          No, later, maybe -- go ahead, I'll
          catch up with you --
               (they head off)
          I've got --
     
     He turns back to Jackie to finish what he was going to say,
     and she's not there. Only a wisp of her cigarette smoke hangs
     in the air, and then it disappears.
     
     George looks surprised and disappointed.
     
     INT. KITCHEN
     
     Several tall stringy types are eating out of the
     refrigerator, with a couple of dogs eagerly watching, others
     are eating hash cakes off the formica counter.
     
     RED DOG sits in a corner, sipping wine out of a measuring
     cup. He smiles and looks up to Jackie, who has her arm on his
     shoulder. Strobe lights from an adjacent room can be SEEN
     PERIODICALLY.
     
                    RED DOG
          Where the fuck you been, Jackie?
          London?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- no.
     
                    RED DOG
          Real good to see you, man.
     
     INT. KITCHEN - JACKIE AND RED DOG
     
                    JACKIE
          So what's been going on, Red Dog?
     
                    RED DOG
          Hey, it's the same old shit, ain't
          it? No matter where you go, it's
          the same old shit. Nothing ever
          changes, nothing, man, nothing.
               (with sudden intensity)
          Hey -- you ever been to Cuuliacaan?
     
     George, a little hastily moves through the kitchen, spotting
     Jackie. He's nearly upended by a couple, tall man and woman
     at the refrigerator. They grab him and kiss him, and he
     shakes through them moving to Jackie.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- where'd you go?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- oh I thought you were --
     
                    GEORGE
          -- what?
     
                    JACKIE
          Nothing.
     
                    RED DOG
          Hey, man, what's happening?
     
                    GEORGE
          Nothing.
     
                    RED DOG
          That's right, man!
     
     And he laughs. George silently takes Jackie's hand and they
     move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds
     in the rear of the house.
     
     EXT. BISTRO PARKING LOT - JOHNNY POPE
     
     The crowd has thinned out to a trickle, but Pope's red
     Porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other
     cars.
     
     Pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to
     move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone
     else.
     
     JILL AND LESTER
     
     Lester stands, swaying a little unsteadily in the lot. The
     Deputy secret service man seen twice earlier, comes on up to
     Lester.
     
                    DEPUTY
          -- we can't find a thing, Mr.
          Karpf.
     
                    LESTER
               (turns to him)
          Can't find what?
     
                    DEPUTY
          No bomb.
     
                    LESTER
          -- oh -- well that's good, isn't
          it?
     
                    DEPUTY
               (he's serious)
          It's good if there's no bomb. If
          there is a bomb and we can't find
          it, that's not good.
     
     EXT. BISTRO PARKING LOT
     
     Lester thinks this over.
     
                    LESTER
          No of course not.
     
                    POPE
               (coming up to Jill)
          -- we're going to be here all
          night.
     
                    JILL
          -- why?
     
                    POPE
          -- these bastards have me hemmed
          in.
     
                    LESTER
               (to Jill)
          -- what's the problem, honey?
     
                    JILL
          -- his car. They have it blocked.
     
                    LESTER
          Oh that's no problem.
               (to Deputy)
          -- take care of this boy's problem,
          will you, Gene?
     
                    DEPUTY
          -- sure.
     
     Pope and Deputy go off together.
     
                    LESTER
          -- listen, I wonder if you kids
          could give me a ride? I'm kind of
          stranded here.
     
                    JILL
          Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
     
     They walk toward Pope's car. The trucks are being driven off.
     
                    LESTER
          Everything okay, son?
     
                    POPE
          Terrific. Now all I have to do is
          find my car keys.
     
     He heads back into the Bistro. Lester and Jill stand outside
     the Porsche.
     
                    JILL
          -- I'll get in the back --
     
                    LESTER
          -- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
     
                    JILL
          -- there's not much room --
     
                    LESTER
          That's fine --
     
     Lester opens the car door and pulls back the seat. He has a
     hell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be
     lighthearted about it. Jill gets into the front.
     
     INT. PORSCHE
     
     The door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet
     are poked out it. His head is pushing on the canvas top.
     
                    LESTER
          See, nothin' to it.
     
     Jill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's
     upper body is almost leaning on her as it is. Lester puts his
     hand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position,
     almost nose to nose with Lester.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          What did you say your name was,
          sweetheart?
     
                    JILL
          Jill.
     
                    LESTER
               (not moving his head)
          Jill.
     
     Jill can't really move her head back and Lester is obviously
     captivated by Jill's face.
     
                    JILL
               (trying to be casual)
          -- yes, Jill.
     
                    LESTER
               (still holding her)
          Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
     
                    JILL
               (very uncomfortable)
          Thank you.
     
                    LESTER
               (fondling her head, moving
               her closer)
          -- just wonderful.
     
     POPE
     
     is heading back to his car. He stops when he sees Lester's
     feet hanging out the door.
     
                    POPE (CONT'D)
               (another irritant)
          Oh, no shit.
     
     Pope gets into the car.
     
                    POPE (CONT'D)
          Hi, what are we doing?
     
     Lester falls back and hits the isinglass rear window. Pope
     notices.
     
                    JILL
          Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride
          home and I said we'd take him. Do
          you mind?
     
                    POPE
               (furious)
          Of course not.
     
                    LESTER
          Call me Les.
     
                    POPE
          Where to, Les?
     
                    LESTER
          Oh, say, how would you kids like to
          stop off for a drink?
     
     Jill and Johnny Pope exchange glances. Jill shrugs to say,
     gee I'm sorry. Pope nods.
     
                    POPE
          Well we'd love to, but we're going
          to another party.
     
                    LESTER
          Well... that's wonderful -- I'll
          stop by there for a drink.
     
     Pope is furious. He starts the car, backs it up quickly,
     jostling Lester around as he goes. Lester chuckles.
     
     EXT. FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT
     
     lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. The
     house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges
     and all sorts of random shrubbery. Jackie and George watch
     the Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a
     couple of androgenous men. The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi,
     arm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another
     end of the jacuzzi.
     
     Jackie smiles. She stretches, yawns.
     
                    JACKIE
               (lazily)
          -- very nice, very nice.
     
                    GEORGE
               (yes)
          -- mmm --
     
     A pause. She glances at George scarcely moving her head.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- but you never were much of a tit
          man --
     
                    GEORGE
          Mmmm --
     
                    JACKIE
          -- ass and legs --
     
                    GEORGE
          Look who's talking.
     
                    JACKIE
          Me?
     
                    GEORGE
          -- yes, you --
     
                    JACKIE
          Well of course. Who loves a big
          fanny on a man?
     
                    GEORGE
          Not me, pal.
     
     Jackie laughs. The Twins have gotten onto some sort of
     splashing contest with the boys. Water hits George and
     Jackie. They're hit again. They shrug, George rises, takes
     Jackie's hand. They walk on around the pool, beside and along
     a maze of hedgerows.
     
     EXT. SAMMY'S - THROUGH PORSCHE WINDOW
     
     as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier
     and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property.
     
                    LESTER
          Whose place is this?
     
     INT. SAMMY'S FOYER
     
     by the open staircase. Pope is greeting Sammy. Introducing
     Jill. Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that
     goes to the knees on his levi's.
     
                    SAMMY
          Sure I know Jill.
     
     Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still
     sitting on the staircase, nursing her baby. She looks up,
     smiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his
     eyes off the sight.
     
                    POPE
               (noticing)
          -- the bar's in there, Les.
     
                    LES
               (embarrassed)
          -- oh, fine.
     
     He strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through
     the open foyer.
     
     AT THE BAR
     
     where Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink.
     The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares
     at it dumbly.
     
                    LESTER
               (a little lamely,
               indicating drink)
          ... I'm...
     
     He takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and
     his eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on
     his feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
     sofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely
     moving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
     from the joints.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER
     
     Lester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink
     and almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe
     lights go on.
     
     Lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do
     with his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light
     effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.
     
     INT. KITCHEN - JILL, RED DOG AND POPE
     
     Jill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his
     measuring cup of wine still half filled.
     
                    JILL
          -- so what's new, Red Dog?
     
                    RED DOG
          Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's
          the same old shit wherever you go,
          nothing ever changes.
     
     Pope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door.
     
                    POPE
          Jill, scraves is a --
     
     He points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like
     he's about to enter.
     
     Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the
     direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had
     taken earlier.
     
     LESTER
     
     peers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt
     beards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and
     continues up it until he finds himself in a den.
     
     Several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and
     watching television. They seem a shade better dressed than
     those in the kitchen.
     
     Lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and
     partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of
     it. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a
     pipe.
     
                    LESTER
               (whispering)
          -- how's it going?
     
     INT. DEN
     
                    MAN WITH PIPE
               (quietly)
          -- just fine.
     
                    LESTER
               (squinting to see)
          -- is that Illinois?
     
                    MAN WITH PIPE
               (taking a good look at
               Lester, then)
          No, that's Sally.
     
     Lester looks at the screen. Sally, handled by bare arms, is
     being placed on a foam rubber cushion. She laughs.
     
                    LESTER
               (dumbly)
          -- Sally?
     
                    MAN WITH PIPE
               (pointing with his pipe
               stem to a girl by
               Lester's ear, also
               watching the set)
          -- Sally.
     
     Lester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back
     to screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a
     television camera and the foam rubber mattress, now
     abandoned. Lester shakes his head.
     
     OUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
     
     They're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them
     to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the
     pool. One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi.
     
                    JILL
          -- so when are you going to Egypt?
     
                    POPE
          You mean when are you going to
          Egypt?
     
     Jill laughs. She turns and shakes her finger at Pope.
     
                    JILL
          Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
     
                    POPE
          Two weeks from tomorrow.
     
                    JILL
          You're going?
     
                    POPE
          You're going.
     
     Jill stops cold. She turns to Pope.
     
                    JILL
          You're kidding.
     
                    POPE
          Those Arabs won't be when they
          start chasing you around the sand
          dunes.
     
                    JILL
               (laughing)
          Johnny!
               (she hugs him)
          Why didn't you tell me before?
     
                    POPE
          -- just before I ask you out? I
          can't do that. Let's get out of
          here before good old Les catches up
          with us again.
     
     There's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill
     turns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind.
     ANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.
     
     INT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's
     looking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens
     again and he closes it again.
     
                    JACKIE
          What's wrong?
     
                    GEORGE
          -- do you want ice?
     
     Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- no.
     
     George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie.
     Neither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each
     other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
     court lights which someone has turned on.
     
                    GEORGE
               (finally)
          -- we're kidding ourselves.
     
                    JACKIE
               (staring right back)
          -- we are?
     
                    GEORGE
          -- last night I dreamt I was fifty
          years old and Mary told me I was
          supposed to meet Jill at the shop.
          It seared me shitless.
     
                    JACKIE
          Why?
     
                    GEORGE
          I can't imagine being with Jill
          when she's fifty years old. I can't
          imagine not being with you.
     
     George moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It
     is long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and
     goes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye
     latch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives
     slightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
     Jackie who stands waiting.
     
                    JACKIE
          -- but what about her? I don't want
          to hurt Jill.
     
     George takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.
     
     LESTER
     
     walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe
     lights are going again in the living room.
     
     Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted
     lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The
     vision disturbs him greatly.
     
     He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
     near her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the
     lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as
     prudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the
     living room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her
     poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
     path that leads down to the pool.
     
     He lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass
     door.
     
     JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
     
     have made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in
     sight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
     
                    POPE
          What's wrong?
     
                    JILL
          We can't really leave that poor man
          here alone.
     
                    POPE
          -- he'll never know the difference.
     
     Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.
     
                    JILL
          -- still -- at least we should tell
          him we're going. C'mon.
     
                    POPE
               (going along with it,
               protesting)
          I'm telling you he won't know the
          difference.
     
     BY THE POOL - LESTER
     
     now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
     that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step
     is a possible disaster.
     
                    TWIN
               (from Jacuzzi)
          Hey.
     
     Lester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is
     outstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the
     shrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.
     
                    TWIN (CONT'D)
          -- it's getting soggy.
     
     Lester takes it.
     
                    THE GUY WITH HER
          -- just put it on the bench over
          there and come on in.
     
                    LESTER
          -- in there?
     
                    THE GUY
          Sure.
     
     Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
     over to the bench. He puts the joint down.
     
     Stares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing
     beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel
     loosely flung over her shoulders.
     
                    TWIN
               (meaning joint)
          Could I have that?
     
     Lester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the
     other Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had
     taken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the
     other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy
     in the pool.
     
     Lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost
     falling down as he does.
     
     Carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.
     
                    LESTER
          Say --
     
                    THE GUY
          -- what is it now, man?
     
                    LESTER
          Do you know where I can find a
          towel?
     
                    THE GUY
          -- the poolhouse.
     
     Holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over
     his boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He
     tries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and
     the latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears
     the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
     love making. The girl is quite carried away.
     
     Lester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with
     fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks
     better of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
     closes the screen door.
     
     He starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side.
     He can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He
     moves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man
     mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
     can be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from
     this angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's
     cries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.
     
                    JILL'S VOICE
          -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --
          Les, we're leaving.
     
     The ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not
     taking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope
     stand beside him.
     
                    LESTER
          Shhh --
               (with genuine awe)
          -- now that's what I call fucking.
     
     Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.
     
     As he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the
     refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic
     impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
     table to another end table and to the refrigerator.
     
     It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
     George and Jackie.
     
     LESTER
     
     who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
     the image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and
     determined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks
     past Jill without looking at her.
     
                    JILL
          -- what --
     
     She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
               (watching)
          Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.
     
     She turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
     through the window, shattering the glass everywhere.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
               (screaming)
          You son of a bitch! You bastard!
     
     WITH GEORGE AND JACKIE
     
     George has leapt up.
     
                    GEORGE
          Honey? Where've you been? We've
          been looking everywhere for you.
     
     Jackie doesn't move, only stares wide-eyed through the broken
     window at the screaming Jill.
     
                    JACKIE
               (softly)
          Oh God.
     
     An ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the
     wall, and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope.
     
     George, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far
     window, pulls it open.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
     
     He's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who
     has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose
     into a purse.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          -- Jesus --
     
                    JACKIE
          -- well you better go after her.
     
     He bends down, turns his pants around, and is hopping into
     them.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- shit...
               (he grabs his shirt)
          ... wait here, honey --
     
     He runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi
     and into the maze of hedgerows. The Twins stand motionless
     side by side in the water.
     
                    TWIN ONE
          George?
               (to Twin Two)
          Who was that?
     
                    TWIN TWO
          Far out.
     
     George, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill.
     He can't find her. He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy
     covered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the
     wall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers
     through the gate calling frantically:
     
                    GEROGE
          Jill, honey?
     
     Inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare
     teeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George
     chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the
     house.
     
     He trips and falls.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM
     
     George running through the strobe-lit party to the foyer.
     He's bare-footed, but his pants are on. His frilly shirt is
     unbuttoned.
     
     INT. FOYER - GEORGE
     
     breathing heavily, spots Red Dog.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, Red Dog. You seen Jill?
     
                    RED DOG
          She just went out the door, man.
     
     George charges out the door in time to see the red Porsche's
     taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it
     purrs off into the night.
     
     George turns and runs back into the house and through the
     strobe-lighting living room.
     
     AT THE POOLHOUSE
     
     George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse.
     The refrigerator door still hangs open. Window glass is
     scattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his
     foot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard. Jackie's gone.
     
                    GEORGE
          Jackie?
     
     He opens the poolhouse bathroom door.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Jackie?
     
     He runs back out the door of the poolhouse.
     
     EXT. POOLHOUSE
     
                    GEORGE
          Jackie?
     
                    TWIN ONE
          She went up to the house, George.
     
                    TWIN TWO
          You're a trip and a half, man.
     
     INT. THE HOUSE
     
     George runs through the living room again and the strobe
     lights. Again he reaches the foyer. Red Dog is still there.
     George is heaving deeply now.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey... you seen... Jackie...
     
                    RED DOG
               (pointing)
          -- out the door, man.
     
     GEORGE charges out the door, this time seeing Jackie's 230SL
     pulling away, tires screeching.
     
                    GEORGE
               (shouting)
          Jackie!
     
     He looks down defeated. His foot is bleeding on the pavement.
     
     EXT. HIGH ROAD - NIGHT
     
     George on his motorbike, COVERED by a few bars of Buffalo
     Springfield's 'For What It's Worth,' has thrown on a peacoat
     but kept on his velvet trousers. He's riding up what should
     now be a familiar road to Jill's. The lights from the city
     below flash in and out of view.
     
     JILL'S GARAGE - GEORGE
     
     pulls in. Her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the
     oil slick stares at him.
     
     There's the SOUND of a CAR coming down the road. He looks up
     expectantly. As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed
     at his feet.
     
     George turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door.
     He pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.
     
     INT. JILL'S - GEORGE - NIGHT
     
                    GEORGE
               (swaying in)
          Jill... Jill... Jill.
     
     He looks in bedroom, then moves back to the phone and dials.
     It rings three times.
     
                    OPERATOR'S VOICE
          Jackie Shawn.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- yeah, this is --
     
                    OPERATOR'S VOICE
          -- yes, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          I guess you haven't heard from her
          yet.
     
                    OPERATOR'S VOICE
          Not yet.
     
                    GEORGE
          Okay... thanks...
     
     He hangs up. Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as
     usual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's
     particularly kitchen.)
     
     George walks over to the window and look's at the city. He
     walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.
     
                                        DISSOLVE TO:
     
     GRAY SCREEN
     
     There is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.
     
     George opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's
     yellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks
     into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the
     kitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.
     
     George glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him,
     frightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got
     no makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm
     and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of
     which George will note in the course of the scene.
     
     George looks her up and down.
     
                    JILL
          I don't want to fight, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't want to fight either.
          Look... uh -- I love you.
     
                    JILL
          Bullshit.
     
                    GEORGE
               (moving to her, taking her
               arm)
          I do, Jill.
     
     At this point he notes the arm bruise. Jill stares back at
     him unflinching. George smiles.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          How come you took your own car?
     
                    JILL
               (getting a cigarette)
          I didn't want him meeting me here.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well that's something.
     
                    JILL
          What is.
     
                    GEORGE
          You didn't plan on fucking him
          tonight.
     
     Jill doesn't answer.
     
     She walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to
     take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe
     over it.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You did fuck him, didn't you?
     
                    JILL
          I'm very tired, George.
     
     Jill goes into the living room. George grabs her arm again.
     
                    GEORGE
          Didn't you, baby?
     
                    JILL
          Let go of me.
     
     George doesn't.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
          Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll
          call the police.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, Christ.
     
     He lets go of her. The PHONE RINGS. Jill answers it. Her tone
     alters appreciably.
     
                    JILL
          Oh, hi... listen, can I call you
          back?... Yes... no, everything's
          fine, really... bye.
     
     She hangs up.
     
                    GEORGE
          That was him.
     
                    JILL
          Yes.
     
                    GEORGE
          You told him I was here and he
          wanted to know if I was beating you
          up.
     
     Jill smiles thinly.
     
                    JILL
          Yes.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, did you get a job out of it
          at least?
     
                    JILL
          I'd like you to leave now.
     
     George doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote
     bag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
          -- and take this with you.
     
                    GEORGE
          Where did this come from?
     
                    JILL
          Who knows, I'm sure you don't --
          but if it'll help any, I found it
          in your bed.
     
     George nods. Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is
     beginning to surface now. Tears start welling in her eyes.
     
                    JILL (CONT'D)
               (unsteadily)
          So who else was there besides
          Jackie? Huh?... huh?
     
                    GEORGE
          Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
     
                    JILL
          Obviously there were others,
          weren't there?
     
     George stares at Jill. Then:
     
                    GEORGE
          Obviously.
     
                    JILL
          How many?
     
                    GEORGE
          What do you wanna know for?
     
                    JILL
          I just want to know, that's all.
     
                    GEORGE
          What difference does it make?
     
                    JILL
          I just want to know while we were
          seeing each other... I just don't
          want girls looking at me and
          knowing and me not knowing...
     
     Jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. George
     moves to her and tries to put his arms around her.
     
                    GEORGE
          Baby, please don't... I love you.
     
                    JILL
               (breaking away)
          I don't want to be a fool!... I
          want to look them in the eye and
          say, I know!
     
                    GEORGE
               (she's backing up, he's
               trying to touch her)
          Baby, don't do this --
     
                    JILL
               (fighting for control)
          -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- please, baby --
     
                    JILL
          -- no, it'll help me, really --
     
                    GEORGE
          How?
     
                    JILL
          I'll know you've lied to me... all
          along. I'll know you're incapable
          of... love... that'll help me...
          not now, but eventually.
     
     It's been rising in him the last few exchanges. Now all
     George's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to
     touch her and stands his ground, exploding:
     
                    GEORGE
          You dumb cunt, everybody fucks
          everybody, grow up, for Christ's
          sakes. You're an antique, you know
          that? Look around you -- all of
          'em, all these chicks they're all
          fucking, they're getting their hair
          done so they can go and fuck,
          that's what it's all about. Come
          into the shop tomorrow and I'll
          show you -- I fucked her, and her,
          and her, and her, and her -- I
          fucked 'em all!... That's what I
          do, I fuck. That's why I went to
          beauty school, to fuck. I can't
          help that, they're there and I do
          their hair and sometimes I fuck
          'em. I stick it in and I pull it
          out and that's a fuck, it's not a
          crime.
     
     George leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not
     even bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together
     a little more by the speech.
     
                    JILL
          ... well I'm glad you told me.
     
                    GEORGE
               (his eyes closed)
          Jesus.
     
     His tone has indicated disbelief and disgust.
     
                    JILL
          I am... I mean, you know, that's...
     
     She can't finish It.
     
                    GEORGE
          What? What? What? What? What?
     
                    JILL
          ... honest. At least you're honest
          with me.
     
                    GEORGE
          Does it make you happy?
     
     Jill doesn't answer.
     
                    JILL
          I wish you'd go now.
     
                    GEORGE
          That's all you've got to say?
     
                    JILL
          -- yes.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- tell me something -- did you
          talk about me?
     
                    JILL
          George...
     
                    GEORGE
          Did you?
     
                    JILL
          Please!... that's not like you.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah, I know. Did you?
     
                    JILL
          George, now cut this out.
     
                    GEORGE
          Did you?
     
                    JILL
          Stop it.
     
                    GEORGE
          Did you?
     
                    JILL
          Yes, yes, I did.
     
                    GEORGE
          What did you say?
     
                    JILL
          George, if you keep this up I'm
          going to scream.
     
                    GEORGE
          What did you say?
     
                    JILL
          George...
     
                    GEORGE
          What did you say?
     
                    JILL
          I said you were a loser!
     
     She starts to cry again. George smiles.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, I'm not a loser, baby, I just
          sort of break even.
     
     George turns and walks up the stairs and out the door.
     
     EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
     
     George shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the
     living room.
     
     INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM
     
     George finds himself facing Lester and two other MEN who look
     like hoods. Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other
     night. Before him is a bottle of J & B, a paper bucket filled
     with melting ice. The other men rise when George walks into
     the room.
     
     Lester, glass in hand, stares silently at George.
     
                    LESTER
               (to the other two)
          Wait outside, would you?
     
     The two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side,
     coming very close. Both of them are much bigger than George.
     They stare through George as they pass him.
     
     George continues to stand there. Lester, drinking, continues
     to stare. Lester glances idly around the living room. Then
     back to George.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          You live like a pig.
     
                    GEORGE
          Yeah.
               (Lester doesn't answer)
          How long have you been here?
     
                    LESTER
               (looking it)
          All night.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well... who are those guys?
     
                    LESTER
          What do they look like?...
     
                    GEORGE
          Look, Lester... are you unhappy
          with me about something?
     
                    LESTER
          Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about
          something.
     
                    GEORGE
          Well, what?
     
                    LESTER
          Godammit, George...
     
                    GEORGE
          Now wait a minute...
     
                    LESTER
          Sit down.
     
                    GEORGE
          But...
     
                    LESTER
          I said sit down!
     
     One of the men opens the door and peers through the screen.
     
                    MAN
          Everything all right?
     
                    LESTER
          I'll call you, it's okay.
     
     George site down. Lester has risen to his feet, a little
     unsteadily.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Now, George, I want to hear it from
          you. Either you admit it, man to
          man, to my face or I'll have him
          pound it out of you, and he does a
          hell of a job, believe me.
     
     George nods.
     
                    GEORGE
          I believe you...
     
     Lester waits, standing over George.
     
                    LESTER
          I wanna hear about it.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh Jesus Christ.
     
     Lester slaps him.
     
                    LESTER
          I wanna hear about it, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, have 'em put me away, or
          whatever you're gonna do, okay?...
          I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired
          to tell the truth... I'm too tired
          for anything.
     
                    LESTER
          I wanna hear about it.
     
                    GEORGE
          What can I say!
     
                    LESTER
          I wanna know your thinking, I wanna
          know how someone like you thinks.
          Did you think you could get away
          with it, did you think you could
          put something over on me? Does a
          guy like you get his kicks sneaking
          around behind people's backs and
          taking advantage of them? Maybe
          that's your idea of being anti
          Establishment!
     
                    GEORGE
          I'm not anti-Establishment.
     
                    LESTER
          That's got nothing to do with it...
          You're so beyond my comprehension I
          can't even discuss it with you.
     
                    GEORGE
          Then don't... just have 'em beat me
          up or whatever you're gonna do.
     
                    LESTER
          No, not yet, not yet. You worry
          about it for a while, I've been
          worrying all night, now you can
          worry.
     
     A pause. Lester freshens his drink.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Was it me, did you have something
          against me?
     
                    GEORGE
          What, do you think I planned it?
     
                    LESTER
          Did they have something against me?
     
                    GEORGE
          Didn't they tell you?
     
                    LESTER
          I wanna hear it from you!
     
                    GEORGE
               (agonized)
          ... how am I gonna tell you what
          they have against you?
          I mean Jesus fucking Christ,
          they're women, aren't they? Have
          you ever listened to women talk,
          man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til
          it's fucking coming out of my ears.
          I'm on my feet all day, every
          fucking day, listening to women
          talk and you know what they talk
          about, don't you? Being fucked up
          by some guy. That's all that's on
          their minds. I'm sure you've done
          something they could get pissed off
          about, what's that got to do with
          it? All women are pissed off, man,
          all of 'em. They fucking hate us!
          Don't you know that?
     
     Lester has listened to this with some alteration of his
     intensity.
     
                    LESTER
          ... yes, I follow your thinking on
          that.
     
                    GEORGE
          We're always trying to fuck them...
          they know it and they like it and
          they don't like it... that's just
          how it is... look, it's got nothing
          to do with you, man. It just
          happened. Felicia's got nothing to
          do but shop and get her hair done
          and she knows she's getting
          older... her daughter hates her,
          what's she going to do, go to PTA
          meetings?
     
                    LESTER
          Do you think Lorna hates her? I
          don't think she hates her. I mean
          she may resent her a little...
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates
          her.
     
                    LESTER
          Why, why do you think that is?
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I
          know?
     
                    LESTER
          Well, I don't know.
     
     A pause. Lester goes to pour himself another drink.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (to George)
          Want a drink?
     
                    GEORGE
          No thanks.
     
                    LESTER
          Have a drink.
     
                    GEORGE
          Okay, thanks.
     
     Lester gets up and goes to the kitchen.
     
                    LESTER
          You don't have a clean glass in the
          house.
     
                    GEORGE
          I know.
     
                    LESTER
               (talking to himself)
          I'll have to wash one out.
     
     He turns on the faucet in the kitchen. He brings the glass.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Jesus, what a way to live. I never
          lived like this, not even when I
          was your age, not even when I never
          had a dime.
     
     George takes the drink. Lester just shakes his head.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Hell of a way to treat a business
          partner, that's all I can say.
     
                    GEORGE
          Who?
     
                    LESTER
          Me!
     
                    GEORGE
          Hey, you were never going to give
          me the money.
     
                    LESTER
               (after a moment)
          I was gonna give you the money.
          Probably I was. Shit, I don't know,
          I don't know anything anymore.
     
     Lester sits and stares into his drink.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I tell you, you never know... you
          just never know... one minute
          you're here and the next... I mean
          a man at my age, how long have I
          got -- ten years? Five years? I
          wish I knew... what I was living
          for.
     
     George looks at him.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          ... You can lose it all; you can
          lose it all no matter who you
          are... I don't know, what's the
          point of having it all. Look at me.
          I don't have a goddam thing... the
          market's terrible right now, went
          down ten points last week, goddam
          Lyndon Johnson!
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh yeah...
     
                    LESTER
          Yeah,, it goes up a little and then
          it goes down, maybe Nixon will do
          something. What's the difference,
          they're all a bunch of jerks. I
          wouldn't let 'em run my business, I
          can tell you that much. Not if I
          had any choice in the matter.
               (after a moment)
          I don't know what to do with you. I
          don't know, I don't know what's
          right or wrong anymore.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't either, Lester, I swear to
          you I don't.
     
                    LESTER
               (suddenly)
          What about Jackie?
     
                    GEORGE
          What about her?
     
                    LESTER
          I mean, how did that happen?
     
                    GEORGE
          Lester, it just happened.
     
                    LESTER
          She's nothing but a whore.
     
                    GEORGE
          No --
     
                    LESTER
          Just a whore, I go over there, have
          a few drinks and get my gun off.
          I'm through with her, she's nothing
          but a whore.
     
                    GEORGE
          No, man, no. You can say
          everybody's a whore. She's okay. I
          mean Jackie'll fuck around but not
          that much. Somewhere she really
          likes you, Lester, and it's not
          just the bread. She's okay.
     
     Lester sits and thinks about that.
     
                    LESTER
          You really think so?
     
                    GEORGE
          Yes I do.
     
                    LESTER
          I'm finished with her.
     
     Lester goes to the door. He turns as if he'd just thought of
     something.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Oh, by the way, I think you oughta
          know -- Lorna thinks she's got the
          clap.
     
                    GEORGE
          What?
     
                    LESTER
          Yeah, the clap. That's what she
          thinks. But who knows -- I don't
          know.
     
     George nods. Lester shakes his head.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I don't know anything anymore.
     
     He opens the door and goes out. The two hoods are standing
     there. They look to Lester.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
               (to hoods)
          Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.
     
     George looks shocked. Lester laughs, gives George a playful
     punch.
     
                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Just having a little fun, George...
               (to hoods)
          Go on home.
               (to George)
          I'll call you later about the shop.
          I'm beat. God, I'm beat.
     
     With that, Lester's off.
     
     EXT. SHOP - GEORGE - DAY
     
     pulls up. He goes into the shop.
     
     INT. SHOP - NORMAN AND DEVRA
     
     Norman is by the front desk.
     
                    NORMAN
          You're late, George.
     
                    GEORGE
          Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you?
          And if you don't reach her, keep
          trying.
     
                    DEVRA
               (on desk)
          Mrs. Shumann and Mrs. Young are
          waiting. Mrs. Young is kind of
          p.o.'d.
     
     George nods.
     
                    GEORGE
          Where's Mary?
     
                    DEVRA
          She hasn't showed up yet.
     
                    GEORGE
               (grumbling something under
               his breath, then:)
          Norman!
               (to Devra)
          Devra, I asked you to call Jackie.
          Call her.
     
                    DEVRA
               (perturbed)
          All right.
     
     Norman from upstairs shouts down.
     
                    NORMAN
          What!
     
                    GEORGE
          Somebody's going to have to wash
          Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
     
                    NORMAN
          You do it.
     
                    GEORGE
               (he's had about enough)
          Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo
          girl.
     
                    NORMAN
          You are today.
     
     George starts to say something but he's tired. He goes to his
     corner, slams his jacket down.
     
                    MRS. SHUMANN
          Temper, temper, George.
     
     George fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses, knocks
     over one where the top was not on, and the shampoo spills all
     over the table top and starts to drip on the floor.
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary-
     
     He starts to look for a rag and sees that Mary, wearing a
     cloth coat is coming into the shop.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Mary! Get over here!
     
     Mary moves very slowly, George waits, hands on hips. It
     should almost be a little faggy, his petulance as if,
     inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Mary, where were you yesterday?
          Huh?
     
     Mary doesn't answer.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You ran out on me and you left it
          like a goddamn pig pen.
     
     Mary's swaying.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk?
          Look, I've had a rough night, one
          of the roughest I've ever had, now
          I'm not in the mood for any sulking
          bullshit, what's wrong? Are you
          sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
     
                    MARY
          Otis is dead.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- Otis?
     
     She points to his picture on the wall.
     
                    MARY
          My son Otis. He was killed in
          Vietnam. They done phoned me at the
          shop yesterday.
     
     It's suddenly very quiet. The SOUND of the SHAMPOO DRIPPING
     on the floor can be HEARD.
     
     GEORGE AND MARY
     
                    GEORGE
          Oh, Mary.
     
     Mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on
     George's shoulder.
     
                    MARY
          -- you shouldn't talk to me like
          that no matter what, George... you
          know better...
     
                    GEORGE
          -- oh -- sweetheart...
     
                    MARY
          -- you shouldn't do me like that...
     
                    GEORGE
               (hugging her)
          -- please, please forgive me...
     
                    MARY
               (crying)
          -- you know better...
     
                    GEORGE
               (after a moment)
          -- why did you come in today?
     
                    MARY
          -- left my bag, didn't have no
          money...
     
                    GEORGE
          -- how did you get here?
     
                    MARY
          -- took a bus.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
     
     EXT. STREET - GEORGE - DAY
     
     on his cycle drives up Bowmont into Jackie's driveway. Her
     car is there.
     
     George jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door. It's
     open and he barges in. He's met by Jackie's Yorkies who bark
     furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for
     attention.
     
                    JACKIE'S VOICE
          -- just a minute, you're early --
     
     Jackie comes walking out. She's carrying a large cooking
     spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a
     pantsuit. She's wearing more makeup than usual. She stops
     when she sees George.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- good afternoon --
     
                    JACKIE
          -- you've got to leave.
     
     George is not prepared for this.
     
                    GEORGE
          I've got to leave?
     
                    JACKIE
          -- yes, honey, you've got to get
          out of here.
     
                    GEORGE
          Why?
     
                    JACKIE
          Lester's on his way.
     
     George stares at her then walks past her into the living
     room. Bags are packed, a coat thrown over them. The wire
     kennel carrying cages for the Yorkies are beside the bags.
     
     George looks into the kitchen where Jackie's been cooking
     some pasta.
     
                    GEORGE
          Where are you going?
     
                    JACKIE
          Please, we'll have to talk later --
     
                    GEORGE
          Look about last night --
     
                    JACKIE
               (exasperated but not
               unkind)
          Forget about last night, it's okay,
          we'll talk when I get back --
     
                    GEORGE
          It's not okay, I mean we've got to
          talk now. Where are you going?
     
                    JACKIE
          Look -- either you leave or I leave
          because I don't want the two of us
          here when Lester arrives. I just
          don't --
     
     The level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty
     decibels. There's the SOUND of a CAR outside.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          My God that's him --
     
     George looks out the window.
     
                    GEORGE
          -- It's Malone's.
     
                    JACKIE
          That's it, then I'm leaving.
     
     With that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes
     out the door. George starts after her. The DRY CLEANER comes
     to the door, stopping George.
     
                    CLEANER
          Cleaners.
     
     George has to fumble with Jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs
     contained. He does, tosses the cleaning down and races
     outside to his bike.
     
     ON THE STREET
     
     he sees Jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill,
     winding around the curves. George guns his bike and takes off
     after her.
     
     AROUND WINDING CURVES - GEORGE
     
     almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. Jackie's on
     the curve above him.
     
     AT THE NEXT CURVE - GEORGE
     
     catches up with her, pulls even to her.
     
                    GEORGE
          Pull over, pull over!
     
     He threatens to run her into the curb. She stops the car
     sharply and jumps out.
     
     AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVE
     
     They've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view
     lot' not built on.
     
     Yellow October weeds cover it and there's a huge television
     antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon
     wind.
     
     Jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. She grabs
     one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down
     below her.
     
     Her house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck
     just pulling away.
     
     George comes up to her.
     
                    JACKIE
               (looking below her)
          You're going to kill me.
     
                    GEORGE
          No --
     
                    JACKIE
               (turning to him,
               imploring)
          Well then what are you trying to do-
     
                    GEORGE
          I want to marry you. I want to take
          care of you and I want your
          children, and I want you to be my
          girl. That's all I want. That's all
          I want out of my life, and it's a
          lot.
     
     She stares at him in disbelief. She actually clutches her
     stomach.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I don't know if I'll ever
          make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but
          I'll take care of you, I'll make
          you happy, I swear to God I will.
     
     Jackie doesn't answer. She slowly sinks to the ground. George
     sinks beside her. Her eyes are wet.
     
                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for
          God's sake, answer me.
     
                    JACKIE
          If you knew how many times I wanted
          to hear you say that...
     
                    GEORGE
          So I'm saying it...
     
                    JACKIE
          It's too late...
     
                    GEORGE
          What's too late about it? Look,
          we're not dead, are we? That's the
          only thing that's too late.
     
                    JACKIE
          Lester's left Felicia. He's taking
          me to Acapulco on the five o'clock
          flight. He's asked me to marry him.
     
                    GEORGE
          So what? You don't love him, do
          you? Answer me.
     
                    JACKIE
          What's that supposed to mean?
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't know... Jackie?
     
                    JACKIE
          What?
     
     George now is very near tears himself. What he says now he
     has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he
     holds.
     
                    GEORGE
          I don't trust... anyone... but
          you...
     
     George lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,
     supported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly
     on her shoulder. She has her arm around him.
     
                    JACKIE
          Oh my baby...
     
     As she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's
     silver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to
     the front door.
     
                    JACKIE (CONT'D)
          God, there's Lester...
     
                    GEORGE
          Don't go, Jackie...
     
                    JACKIE
          I can't just let him stand by the
          door...
     
                    GEORGE
          Don't leave me...
     
                    JACKIE
          I've got to... I've got to tell him
          where I am.
     
                    GEORGE
          What for?
     
                    JACKIE
          I don't know -- I've got to.
     
     She gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes
     back down the hill. George sits under the television aerial
     and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing
     INTO VIEW.
     
     Finally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.
     She hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk
     for a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving
     Lester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.
     
     George is watching them.
     
     He sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his
     arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going
     through the front door.
     
     THE END
