1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING

    A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,
    makes its way along a stretch of motorway.


2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING

    At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes
    closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
    bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He
    pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play
    on his MP3.


3   INT. COACH. MORNING

    Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff
    face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,
    Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music
    from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day",
    a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and
    comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.

    The track will play over the following opening scenes, the
    credits fading subtly in and out in white text.


4   EXT. STREET. MORNING

    We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
    through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
    house the east end after the Second World War.

                                                      CUT TO:

    We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through
    those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.

                            SHIFTY

    Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
    fence, making a short cut.


5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING

    Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,
    pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,
    holding his nose.


    SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST
    CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.
                                                            2.

6    INT. COACH. MORNING.

     Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on
     his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just
     catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.


7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of
     cocaine onto a clean glass table.


8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white
     dressing gown, prepares breakfast.


9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping
     over a fence at the end.


10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.


11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING

     In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He
     climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real
     enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.


12   INT. COACH. MORNING

     Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same
     strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.


13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.


14   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING

     Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His
     mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.
                                                           3.

15   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.


16   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his
     shoulder.

     A BEAT.

     He turns and walks off.


17   TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING

     Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his
     face, he seems a little more with it.


18   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one
     half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.


19   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING

     Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.


20   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY

     Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his
     shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.


21   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes
     it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.


22   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNING

     Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.


23   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING

     Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad
     facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine
     mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the
     rush.
                                                           4.

24   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of
     paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He
     stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our
     soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head
     phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.


25   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears
     the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts
     it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Fucking hell, man...

     Shifty can't help but smile.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               You're early!

                         CHRIS
               Shifty.

     A smile creeps across Chris' face.

                         SHIFTY
               Yes, rude boy.

                         CHRIS
               You alright geezer.

                         SHIFTY
               I'm sweet... come in, man, come in.

     Shifty and Chris embrace.

                         CHRIS
               Good to see you, mate.

                         SHIFTY
               Good to see you too, geezer.


26   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING


     CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP.

     Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag
     perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.
                                                           5.

27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING

     Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and
     pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New
     DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,
     lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,
     books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked
     pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed
     across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of
     Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning
     sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He
     stands, staring.


28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast
     ready. Shifty turns to face him.

                         SHIFTY
               You alright son?

                         CHRIS
               Yeah I just needed to splash my
               face, freshen up a bit.

                         SHIFTY
               Have you slept?

                         CHRIS
               Did I fuck.

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, neither have I... I just got
               back from some girls yard.

                         CHRIS
               You got a bird?

                         SHIFTY
               No, no... just some fucking booty
               call.

                         CHRIS
               What, Break Glass Arse?

                         SHIFTY
               In case of emergency's, man... you
               know it.

     They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan.

                          CHRIS
               She fit?

                          SHIFTY
               What!
                                                      6.

                       CHRIS
          She fit?

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah, she's alright you know....
          She's got fucking massive Gary's.

Chris laughs.

                    CHRIS
          You always loved your titties,
          bruv.

                    SHIFTY
          You know that!

Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Mate, do you mind halal?

                    CHRIS
          No, no, that's sweet mate,
          whatever.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY
          Were you on just one bus?

                    CHRIS
          Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to
          change at Luton.

                       SHIFTY
          LUTON!

                       CHRIS
          Yeah, man.

                    SHIFTY
          Fucking random.

Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving
about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,
opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large
bag of sweet corn.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          I've got a few things to do today
          geezer, you can stay here if you
          want, just chill out.

He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out
tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places
them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty
closely, but doesn't say anything.
                                                           7.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Or you can come with me?

                           CHRIS
               Whatever.

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
                   (whispers)
               Does your brother know you keep
               those there?

     Shifty shakes his head.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
                   (Whispering)
               You not worried?

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, he doesn't eat vegetables.

     Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm.


     WE STAY ON CHRIS' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN.

                         SHIFTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Apart from in a pot noodle.


29   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING

     We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and
     walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old
     boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth
     Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl
     eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst
     talking on the phone.

                           JASMINE
                     (on phone)
               ... she's living like a drifter babe,
               I'm telling you, she's split... sort
               of... with Stefan... I know she did...
               but she stays at Mike's in the
               week, and then she's back at
               Stefan's at the weekend... with the
               kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop
               banging your bowl...

     Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out
     for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.
                                                            8.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
               ...Neither knows about the other, and
               then she expects me (she drops to a
               whisper) to fucking cover for her
               (normal volume) Stefan's my mate
               for Christ's sake, I'm not getting
               caught up in that whole mess (to
               boy) Freddie, sit down and finish
               your breakfast!

     This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the
     table.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
               ... and she has a go at me for taking
               on too much
                     (she laughs - then without
                      looking up)
               Babe, I'm cooking you some eggs...

     SLAM - the front door crashes shut - he's gone - his
     breakfast untouched.

                             JASMINE (CONT'D)
               Oh... what... nothing, Trevor's just
               walked out without touching his
               breakfast... I don't know, I thought
               so anyway...


30   EXT. DRIVEWAY. MORNING

     Silence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding.
     He approaches his work van. "T. PALMER - BUILDER'S MERCHANT"
     inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings
     - he answers.

                         JASMINE
               What's the matter?

     Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray.

                         TREVOR
               Nothing, I'm fine.

                         JASMINE
               Why didn't you say good-bye?

                         TREVOR
               You were gassing away to Nicola...

                          JASMINE
               And why didn't you touch your
               breakfast?
                                                           9.

                         TREVOR
               I'm not hungry.

     Off Screen Freddie yells.

                         JASMINE
               What's the matter with you?

                           TREVOR
               I'm fine.

     She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs.

                         JASMINE
               Where's the grey suitcase?

                         TREVOR
               What? I can't hear you babe.

                         JASMINE
               I want to start getting stuff ready
               for next week - where's the grey
               suitcase?

                         TREVOR
               I'll find it when I get home.

                         JASMINE
               It's all right babe I'll get it.

                         TREVOR
               Jasmine, I'll get it when I get
               home.

                         JASMINE
               Babe it's fine, I'll get it down.

                         TREVOR
                   (Stern)
               I'LL FIND THE FUCKING THING WHEN I
               GET HOME.

     CLICK!

     He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then
     starts the engine.


31   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNING

     Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's
     temperament, and watches through the front room window as he
     drives away.
                                                          10.

32   INT. SHIFTY'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Shifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez,
     Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.

                          REZ
                   (PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED)
               Motherfucker, the return of the
               white man.

     Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and
     grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.

                         CHRIS
               How you doing Rez, good to see you,
               man?

                          REZ
               I wondered why I could hear voices.
               I thought he'd brought home a rent
               boy again.

                         SHIFTY
               Shut up you prick.

                         REZ
                   (To Chris)
               You look like a rent boy.

                         CHRIS
               What are you talking about?

     Points at Chris.

                          REZ
               That top cost more than my
               education.

                          CHRIS
               My pants cost more than your
               education.

                         REZ
                   (sings)
               Cold blooded.

     Shifty lays down three plates of breakfast. Rez fakes a heart
     attack.

                         SHIFTY
                   (PAKISTANI)
               Soak it in fat boy.

                         CHRIS
               I take it this doesn't happen
               often.
                                                          11.

                         REZ
               You know what, I'm emotional,
               where's my camera, bring me my
               camera. Quick, man, quick.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, fucking laugh it up.

                         REZ
                   (PAKISTANI)
               Don't worry I will.

     Shifty sits down and they begin their food.


33   EXT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNING

     Trevor sits at the wheel, parked in a residential street. He
     dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message

                         (V.O.)
               This number is currently
               unavailable please try agai...

     He puts down the phone, and sits there, waiting, agitated.


34   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN.   MORNING.

     All three of them eat in silence. Chris' eyes dart
     occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the
     food. There is an uncomfortable air in the room.


35   INT. TREVORS'S VAN. MORNING

     Trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key. We
     see that he doesn't have a huge amount left in his wrap.


36   INT. REZ'S HOUSE/KITCHEN. MORNING

     Shifty's putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the
     table. Rez stabs away with a tooth pick measuring up Chris,
     who reads a magazine.

                         REZ
                   (to Chris)
               Do you think I've put on weight?

     Chris looks up.

                         CHRIS
               What?

                         REZ
               Do you think I've put on weight?
                                               12.

A BEAT.

                    CHRIS
          I dunno. Not really.

He's lying.

                    REZ
              (to Shifty)
          I told you I haven't put on that
          much weight.

Shifty lets out a sarcastic laugh.

                    REZ (CONT'D)
          How long since you've been back?

Shifty sits back down and answers for Chris.

                    SHIFTY
          Four years.

                    REZ
          Is that the last time I saw you,
          fucking hell?

                    CHRIS
          Yeah. Was it? Yeah, four years ago
          I think.

A BEAT.

                    REZ
          Where you living?

                    CHRIS
          Manchester.

                    REZ
          What you doing?

                    CHRIS
          What, work wise? I'm in
          recruitment.

                    REZ
          Good money?

Chris abandons his magazine.

                    CHRIS
          I do alright, yeah.

                      REZ
          How much?
                                                    13.

                     CHRIS
               (laughs)
           Enough.

                     REZ
           You need to get this Gadha (donkey)
           some work, four A-levels and no
           job.

                     SHIFTY
           I pay you fucking rent don't I?

Silence.

                     REZ
           Girlfriend?

                     CHRIS
           No, not yet.

                        REZ
           Gay?

                        CHRIS
           No... you?

                     REZ
           I'm asking the questions padre... for
           your information... no, I'm not...
           but Shifty is.

                        SHIFTY
           Jokes.

A BEAT.

                     SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               (to Chris)
           What have you got, rent or
           mortgage?

                     CHRIS
           Fucking hell, tag team... Mortgage.

                     REZ
           That's nice.

                     SHIFTY
           Yeah, mature, man.

A BEAT.

                     REZ
           Why do you leave without saying
           goodbye to my brother?

Chris is stumped. Shifty looks down at the floor.
                                                     14.

                    SHIFTY
          Rez, man...

                    REZ
          I'm only joking...

A BEAT.

                    REZ (CONT'D)
          But really, why?

                    SHIFTY
          Leave him alone.

                    REZ
          I need info, man. I'm like a
          sponge, do you know what I mean,
          I'm like a flannel... How come
          your back, what's the deal?

                    SHIFTY
          I invited him to a party.

                    REZ
          Who's party?

                      CHRIS
          Rachel's.

                    REZ
          Rachel who?

                    SHIFTY
          Rachel Price.

                      REZ
          Who?

                    SHIFTY
          Mate, Rachel and Serena.

Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy
stare.

                      REZ
          Oh right.

Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw
nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the
ice by talking about a more trivial topic.

                    SHIFTY
              (to Rez)
          You remember Rachel, you fucking
          lunged her at Jazzbo Browns?
                                                          15.

                           REZ
               WHAT... that's BULLSHIT.

                         CHRIS
               Yeah, yeah, you went in for the
               kill and she lent away like she was
               doing the fucking limbo.

     Chris is back in the conversation.

                         SHIFTY
               Her ponytail swept the floor.

     Shifty and Chris touch fists.

                           REZ
               You boys need to get your facts
               straight... she fucking lunged me.

                         CHRIS
               You couldn't even remember who she
               was five minutes ago.

     Shifty and Chris crack up laughing.

                         SHIFTY
                   (to Chris)
               I wouldn't mind if he did it
               discreetly, but he lunged her from
               about three feet.

     Shifty mimics Rez's historic lunge, Rez starts to laugh at
     the memory of it, covering his face with his hands.


37   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNING

     Trevor tries the mobile again but gets the same message. He
     throws his phone onto the passenger seat and exits the car.


38   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN MORNING.

     They still sit around the table.

                         SHIFTY
                   (to Rez)
               You can come along if you want.

                         REZ
                   (sarcastically)
               Yeah, I feel like it now, don't
               I... fucking hell...

     Suddenly the door bell goes.
                                                           16.

                         REZ (CONT'D)
                   (to Shifty)
               Get that, it's probably your viagra
               delivery.

                           SHIFTY
               Fuck off.


39   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / FRONT DOOR. MORNING

     Shifty opens the door.

                         SHIFTY
                   (suspicious)
               Trevor.

                         TREVOR
               Alright mate.

     Shifty steps out and pulls the door to behind him.


40   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Rez stares at Chris who's still reading a magazine.

                         REZ
               So come on, why are you back...
               really?

     Chris looks up at him. He's not ready for this question.

                         CHRIS
               Because of the, erm, because of the
               party...

                         REZ
               There's been hundreds of parties
               mate, what's so special about this
               one?

                         CHRIS
               I dunno, I just wanted to see
               Shifty didn't I.

     Rez just stares at him. Chris looks back at the magazine,
     trying to pretend he's reading.


41   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE. MORNING

                         TREVOR
               I was trying to bell you geezer,
               your phones off.
                                                          17.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah I know, mate?

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Trevor, what do you want?

     Trevor doesn't say anything, just nods his head, as if Shifty
     should know what he's talking about. Shifty closes his eyes
     taking stock.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Mate, you haven't... you haven't
               paid me for last week yet?

     Trevor looks a little uncomfortable.

                         TREVOR
               Do me a favour, I've probably put
               your fucking kids through college,
               do you know what I mean?

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, keep your voice down.

     A BEAT.

     Shifty considers.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Meet me at the top of the road by
               the telephone box.

                         TREVOR
               Mate you're a fucking diamond.


42   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Still watching Chris, Rez speaks.

                         REZ
               For some reason... I dunno why...
               he still thinks of you as his best
               mate.

     He get's up to leave.

                         REZ (CONT'D)
               Why don't you try acting like one.


     WE'RE TIGHT ON CHRIS. HE'S TAKEN ABACK BY REZ'S COMMENT.
                                                          18.

43   INT/EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / HALLWAY. MORNING

     Trevor goes to walk away.

                            SHIFTY
               Trevor...

                         TREVOR
               Yes mate...

                         SHIFTY
               Don't ever fucking come to my house
               again.

                         TREVOR
               Yeah, no worries, I'm sorry, man.

     Shifty walks in, shutting the door. Rez walks past him to go
     upstairs.

                         REZ
               Who was that?

                         SHIFTY
               Nothing, geezer wanted to talk to
               me about a job.

                            REZ
               What job.

                            SHIFTY
               Labouring.

     Rez ascends the stairs.

                         REZ
               What did you say?

                         SHIFTY
               I'd think about it.

     Shifty goes to walk off.


44   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. MORNING.

     Rez, reaching the top of the stairs, calls down.

                            REZ
               Shafiq.

                            SHIFTY (O.S.)
               What!

                         REZ
               Don't forget.
                                                          19.

                         SHIFTY (O.S.)
               What?

                         REZ
               Mum and dads.

                         SHIFTY (O.S.)
                   (PAKISTANI)
               Do me a favour.

                         REZ
                   (PAKISTANI)
               Just do it.


45   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / HALLWAY. MORNING.

     Shifty looks agitated.

                         SHIFTY
                   (PAKISTANI)
               I'm going to this fucking party.

                          REZ (O.S.)
                   (PAKISTANI)
               What time.

                         SHIFTY
                   (PAKISTANI)
               Nine.

                         REZ (O.S.)
                   (PAKISTANI)
               You can be there at seven.

                         SHIFTY
                   (PAKISTANI)
               For fucks sake.


46   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. MORNING.

                         REZ
                   (PAKISTANI)
               JUST FUCKING BE THERE.


47   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY. MORNING.

     Shifty stands there, seething, and walks away.


48   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNING

     Trevor, sits in his van, by the telephone box waiting..
                                                          20.

49   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / HALLWAY. MORNING

     Shifty and Chris stand in the hallway putting on their
     jackets. They go to leave when Shifty stops and considers
     something.

                         SHIFTY
               Actually, let's go out the back
               way, it'll be quicker.

     They head for the garden.


50   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNING

     Trevor sits. Waiting. He taps his finger on the steering
     wheel. Agitated. Every second an eternity.


51   EXT. BACK PASSAGE. MORNING

     Shifty and Chris walk for a moment in silence.

                         CHRIS
               We gonna see your mum and dad
               later?

                         SHIFTY
               No.

                         CHRIS
               I just heard... erm... I wasn't
               being nosey, I just heard Rez...

     Chris doesn't want to push the subject any further. There's
     silence as they walk.

                           SHIFTY
               ...Do you know they've ignored me for
               about a year...

                         CHRIS
               I didn't know?

                           SHIFTY
               ...my mum puts the phone down when
               she hears my voice...

     A BEAT.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               My dad crosses the road if he sees
               me in the street, then they fucking
               summon me for a fucking job
               interview.

     Silence, the two carry on walking.
                                                          21.

                            CHRIS
               For what?

                         SHIFTY
               They just want me to meet some up-
               his-arse-paki who'll look at me
               like some lost fucking cause!

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS
               You gonna go?

                            SHIFTY
               Am I fuck.


52   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     Trevor drives slowly past the house to see Rez putting out
     the rubbish. Rez turns around and stares at Trevor. Trevor
     looks away and drives off.


53   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / UP STAIRS BATHROOM. DAY

     Jasmine sits on the toilet, she opens a pregnancy test and
     urinates onto it.


54                                                                   *
     INT. TREVORS' HOUSE. BATHROOM (PART 1) / FREDDIE'S BEDROOM.
                                                                     *
     DAY (PART 2)

     Freddie is on his games console. He's at the controls of a
     racing game. It's on really loud.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Holding up the pregnancy test Jasmine see's it turn to a plus
     sign. She's pregnant again.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Tight on the screen as Freddie's computerised car screeches
     around a corner.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Jasmine stares forward, her face fretful.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Freddie's car smashes loudly against a barrier.

                                                       CUT TO:
                                                          22.

     Sitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the
     tiled surface. She rubs her finger over it to reveal the
     residue of a white powder.

                                                       CUT TO:

     The game is loud. Echoing through the house.

                                                       CUT TO:

     She dabs finger with tongue, her face sours. She was almost
     hoping she was wrong.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Jasmine's eyes are alive with rage; the TV bellows out -
     suddenly she stands, pulls up her kickers and steams towards
     Freddie's room.

                         JASMINE
                   (screaming)
               TURN THAT FUCKING TV DOWN BEFORE I
               THROW IT OUT OF THE FUCKING WINDOW!

     Freddie little face is totally bewildered.


55   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY

     Shifty and Chris approach a clapped out, red four-door VW
     Golf circa 1986. As they loom closer Glen exits the car from
     the back.

                         GLEN
               What you saying you fucking rag-
               head, you alright bad boy?

                         SHIFTY
               Dowdy!

                         GLEN
               You been on the roids mate you're
               looking bigger?

     Shifty's almost exasperated with Glen already.

                         SHIFTY
               No, I haven't, no.

                         GLEN
               You getting ready for a fucking
               uprising.
                                                     23.

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah, just a small one.

Shifty and Glen knock fists.

                    GLEN
          We better be careful, seems like
          there's a Tally-barn in town.

                    SHIFTY
          Give it a fucking rest geezer.

                    GLEN
          You know I'm only fucking about you
                                                           *
          prick.

Glen looks over at Chris. He takes him in.

                    GLEN (CONT'D)
          How you doing mate, you alright?

                    CHRIS
              (warily)
          Alright.

Glen grabs Shifty and pulls him to one side. His face is
close to Shifty's ear, his insipid breath hot.

                    GLEN
          Who the fuck is that?

                    SHIFTY
          Chill out, he's an old mate of
          mine.

                    GLEN
          Don't just bring any fucking Muppet
          to the party, at least let me know
          first, do you know what I mean,
          give me a fucking heads up.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY
              (calm)
          Yeah.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
              (collected)
          Alright mate.

A BEAT.
                                                     24.

                    GLEN
          Anyway, I've got, erm, I've got a
          message for you.

A BEAT.

                       SHIFTY
          What?

                    GLEN
          Magnus wants you to call him
          tonight?

                    SHIFTY
          What? Magnus never wants me to call
          him.

Glen shrugs.

A BEAT.

                    GLEN
          I dunno, mate...

Shifty watches Glen.

                    SHIFTY
          Where's the gear?

                    GLEN
          Lenny's got it.

                                                               *
As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of
                                                               *
money to Glen. Seated in the driver's seat sits Lenny, a
frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket
giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking
corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She's pulling out a
crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the
window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny,
slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into
his lap.

                    SHIFTY
          Alright Lenny?

                    LENNY
          Alright mate.

                    SHIFTY
          You alright Loretta.

                    LORETTA
          Alright Shifty.
                                                           25.

56   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAY

     Rez lays down a prayer mat. He kneels down and begins to
     pray.


57   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY

     Glen stands smoking, staring at Chris.   Suddenly Glen speaks.

                         GLEN
               I fucking... I swear I know you
               from somewhere?

     A BEAT.

     Chris can feel Glen's eyes on him.

                            CHRIS
               I dunno...

                         GLEN
               I do, I know you from somewhere.

     Chris stays silent.

                         GLEN (CONT'D)
               D'you used to knock out pills?

                         CHRIS
                   (dismissive)
               Yeah, now and again.

     Glen carries on staring at him.

                         GLEN
               Yeah, yeah, I know where I fucking
               know you from... you used to go out
               with Serena Ellis?

                         CHRIS
               Yeah, a few years ago?

                         GLEN
               You'd fucking hope so, she's dead
               you cunt.

     Glen laughs at his own joke. Chris looks furious. Shifty
     walks back over.

                            SHIFTY
               Come!

                         GLEN
               Right you done?
                   (Shifty nods)
               Good.
                         (MORE)
                                                          26.
                         GLEN (CONT'D)
                   (he takes a final drag on
                    his fag)
               Don't go blowing up any fucking
               tube trains.

     Glen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and
     storms off, Shifty follows after him.


58   INT. LENNY'S CAR. DAY

     Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the
     rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it
     to Lenny.

                         GLEN
               What are we waiting for?

                         LENNY
               Give me a fucking break I'm rushing
               my tits off...

     Lenny attempts to start the car.

                         LENNY (CONT'D)
               Where's the keys babe?

                         LORETTA
               Let's just go Lenny. I'm freaking
               out.

     Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously
     tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive
     off, frog-hopping the VW down the road.

                         GLEN
               Yeah, it's a good job we're not
               making a fucking scene.


59   EXT. ROW OF GARAGES. DAY

     Chris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris
     stands there for a moment his fists clenched.

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, are you alright?

                         CHRIS
               Yeah, I'm fine.

                         SHIFTY
               What's the matter, what did he say?
                                                          27.

                         CHRIS
               Geezer don't worry about,
               just...don't worry about it, it's
               cool, I'm alright.


60   EXT/INT. BUILDING SITE. DAY

     Trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta-cabin
     and let's himself in. We follow him into see Bob Moran,
     portly, sitting at a desk, another gentleman, in a suit and
     hard-hat stands before the desk. Bob spots Trevor.

                         BOB
               No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

                         TREVOR
               Bob!

     Bob comes around from his side of the desk.

                         BOB
               No, Trevor, no.

                         TREVOR
               Bob just hear me out.

                         BOB
               Get out of my office.

                         TREVOR
               Bob please I've paid out on all the
               materials, I've lost money.

                         BOB
               You should have thought about that
               before you started bringing drugs
               onto my site.

                         TREVOR
               You owe me money.

                         BOB
               I owe you fuck all.

                         TREVOR
               YOU OWE ME MY FUCKING MONEY.

                         BOB
               Tell it to the police, and I'll
               tell `em why you got kicked off the
               fucking job.

                         TREVOR
               Bob, please.
                                                          28.

                         BOB
               Fuck off, Trevor.

     Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.

                          TREVOR
               Bob.

     Bob ignores him.

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
               Bob I need this money.

     Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to
     him. Trevor stands behind them.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
               Bob!

     Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.

                         BOB
               Thank's for coming today Trevor,
               we'll definitely be in touch.

     Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
     turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
     then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with
     emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it
     together.


61   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY

     Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a
     skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty
     hands Chris a rolled spliff. Shifty doesn't say anything,
     doesn't want to push Chris.

               passed out... but apparently she
               was lying up against a radiator...
               the fucking thing came on full
               whack. She was so out of it, she
               didn't even know it was on....

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               ...the paramedics had to peel her
               off.

                         CHRIS
               Jesus Christ!

     Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts
     ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He
     hits reject.


62   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     Trevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his
     dashboard.


63   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY

     Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine
     and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but
     it comes out completely from the machine.

                         REZ
               FUCK!

     He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez
     gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks
     in the gap, and sees something.
                                                          30.

     He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has
     something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through,
     watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez
     sits back against the machine just staring at it.


64   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY

     Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something.

                         CHRIS
               What's that?

                          SHIFTY
               What?

     Chris points.

                         CHRIS
               That fucking thing.


65   EXT. PARK. DAY

     Shifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that
     helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam
     are two handles.

                         CHRIS
               What does it fucking do?

     Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               Mate, grab the other end.

     Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to
     Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               FUCKING HELL!

                         SHIFTY
               SHIIIIIIIIT!

     They're both cracking up laughing, loving it.


66   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY

     On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting
     bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds
     of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing
     gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the
     emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her
     haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum.
                                                          31.

     WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM
     WATCHING HER.


67   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY.

     A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms.


68   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY

     Shifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which
     a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number
     eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the
     emblem of the cat.

                         SHIFTY
               Fucking cat lovers.

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS
               I can't stand people who feed their
               cat's... fucking red snapper... or
               goose liver, because they say the
               fucking things fussy...

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               ...it's a fucking cat.

                         SHIFTY
               Wait until you see this...

                         CHRIS
                                                                    *
               Starve the fucking thing for a week
               and it'll eat a condom, do you know
               what I mean...

     Shifty laughs. Then they stand for a second waiting. Shifty
     knocks again.

                            SHIFTY
               C'mon Val.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Sorry about this geez.

                         CHRIS
               Mate, it's cool.

                         SHIFTY
               I didn't wanna drag you around all
               day.
                                                          32.

     A BEAT.

     Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a
     shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps,
     echoing down the clinical looking hallway.


69                                                                  *
     INT. VALERIE'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAY

     We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and
     colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller.
     We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the
     first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands
     and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is
     clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping
     cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.

     A BEAT.

     Valerie looks towards Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm,
               he's an old friend of mine, we grew
               up together. He's cool. We go way
               back. So it's cool, you know.

                         CHRIS
               How you doing?

     He offers a hand that she takes politely.

                           VALERIE
               Yeah. Hi.

     A moment of uncomfortable silence.

                         SHIFTY
               I called yesterday but you were
               out.

                           VALERIE
               When?

                         SHIFTY
               I dunno, It was probably about two
               in the afternoon.

                         VALERIE
               I was in all day.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY
               You must have been asleep.
                                                          33.

                         VALERIE
               No, no I was awake, I didn't sleep.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY
               I dunno then.

                         VALERIE
               Did you say two o'clock.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah.

                         VALERIE
               Are you sure it wasn't two thirty.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY
               It may have been.

                         VALERIE
               I was out on the balcony at two
               thirty.

     A BEAT.

                         VALERIE (CONT'D)
               But I was in here at two.

     A BEAT.

                         VALERIE (CONT'D)
               I'll make us some tea.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, that'll be sweet.


70                                                                   *
     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY

     Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front
     room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks
     up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days,
     fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He
     looks slightly shocked to see this.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room.
     He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves
     his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not
     moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all
     the cats in the room are stuffed.
                                                          34.

     Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the
     deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the
     wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat
     ornaments rattle.


71                                                                   *
     INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY

     Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the
     counter top.

                         SHIFTY
               How you been, alright.

                         VALERIE
               Yeah, I'm alright babe, you
               alright?

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, I'm alright.

                         VALERIE
               Good, good.

     Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.

                         SHIFTY
               She visited you yet?

                         VALERIE
               No... not for a long time,
               Shifty... not seen her for a long
               time really, darling.

     Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the
     tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He
     places a hand on her arm.

                         SHIFTY
               She'll come back one day.

     They carry on making the tea.


72                                                                   *
     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY

     The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A
     fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink.
     Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
     Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what
     he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small
     yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a
     smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments
     falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie
     walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully
     back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by
     the music.
                                                           35.

      We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to
      her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her
      lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.

                          CHRIS
                No, no, I'm fine......thanks
                though.


      CLOSE ON SHIFTY.

                          SHIFTY
                Look Val we're gonna have to do
                one...


      THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO
      SHIFTY...

      Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding
      bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly
      unsettled by what he's seen.


73                                                                    *
      EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE'S FLAT. DAY

      Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to
      walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He
      pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried
      on walking.

                          SHIFTY
                Geezer, give me a minute.

      Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his
      jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to
      unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n'
      bass booming out.


73A                                                                   *
      INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY

      Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark
      hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty
      peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -
      a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the
      hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal
      a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays
      out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,
      Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the
      films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,
      cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to
      the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just
      staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.
      Shifty stares him out.
                                                          36.

                                                                *
                         SHIFTY
               Alright mate?

                          OTIS
               Alright.

     Shifty looks about at the room.

                         SHIFTY
               What's your name?

                          OTIS
               Otis.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY
               Where do you get your weed from?

                         OTIS
               It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my
               mate left it, he left it here... I
               could phone him if you want, he'll
               sort you out...

                         SHIFTY
               Where d'you get your fucking weed
               from rude boy?

     A BEAT.

                         OTIS
               I get it from this geezer... Glen
               Dowdy innit.

     Shifty smiles.

                         SHIFTY
               No, you don't.


74   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / CORRIDOR. DAY

     Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable.


75   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY

                         OTIS
               No his names Glen, I'm sure it is
               man, his names Glen innit?

                         OTIS' GIRLFRIEND
               Yeah, I think so.
                                                          37.

                         SHIFTY
               From now on you get your weed from
               me...

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               At half the price.

     Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly
     confused.


76   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY

     Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16,
     pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened
     by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.


77   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY

                         SHIFTY
               I'm gonna sell you your weed half
               price, and your gonna keep this
               noise down.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Yeah?

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                   (with threat)
               YEAH?

     At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris
     standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the
     situation.

                         OTIS
               Yeah, alright, yeah.

                         SHIFTY
               Because if I hear one word of
               complaint from next door, just one
               single complaint, I'll come back
               here and I'll take your TV, I'll
               take your stereo, and I'll shove em
               up your birds arse.

     He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Do you understand me?
                                                            38.

     Otis nods.

                            SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

                             OTIS
                  Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry,
                  man, I didn't know I had it on
                  loud, I would have turned it down,
                  I'm sorry.

     Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty
     picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis'
     wall.

                            SHIFTY
                  Call me if you need any more weed.

     He walks into the hallway, past Chris.

                            CHRIS
                      (almost disdain)
                  You don't miss a fucking trick.

                            SHIFTY
                  You know it.


78   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAY

     Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of
     the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates.


     CLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB.

     Shifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind.

     A BEAT.

                            CHRIS
                  That was all a bit fucking surreal.

                            SHIFTY
                  What d'you mean?

                            CHRIS
                  I can't believe you just sold crack
                  to Miss Marple and struck a deal
                  with Blazing Squad.

     Shifty laughs as they carry on descending.

                            CHRIS (CONT'D)
                  How old is she?
                                                39.

                       SHIFTY
          About 70.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          She's been doing drugs longer than
          we've been alive.

A BEAT.

                    CHRIS
          Yeah, d'you reckon.

A BEAT.

                    CHRIS (CONT'D)
          When did you start knocking out?

                    SHIFTY
          Knocking out what?

                    CHRIS
              (lowers his voice)
          Crack.

                    SHIFTY
          I dunno, about...three, three and a
          half years ago.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Why when d'you stop knocking out
          pills.

                    CHRIS
          When do you think?

A BEAT.

                    CHRIS (CONT'D)
          Do you get involved?

                       SHIFTY
          No.

A BEAT.

                       SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Have you?

                       CHRIS
          Fuck that.

They still descend the stairs.
                                                          40.

                         SHIFTY
               Do you wanna try it?

     Chris looks at him, unsure if he's joking.

                         CHRIS
               Only if I get a fucking discount.

                          SHIFTY
                    (Asian accent)
               I have to charge you wholesale, you
               know. I got family in Pakistan,
               they need ticket for plane travel,
               man.

     They both laugh.


79   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY

     Jasmine is at the kitchen table with Freddie and Katie who
     are doing potato painting. Jasmine is dialing her mobile. She
     presses it to her ear.


80   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     Trevor is parked up in his van, just staring out. We see his
     phone vibrating on the dash board. He answers.

                            TREVOR
               Jasmine...


81   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / TREVOR'S VAN. KITCHEN. DAY

     Her tone is cold distant.

                         JASMINE
               Where's the credit card?

                            TREVOR
               What for?

                         JASMINE
               I want to book a hire car.

                         TREVOR
               We don't need one.

                         JASMINE
               How are we gonna get about with two
               kids.

                         TREVOR
               We'll get taxis.
                                                          41.

                         JASMINE
               It'll be cheaper to get a hire car.

                         TREVOR
               Jasmine, we're not getting a hire
               car.

                         JASMINE
               Don't ruin this for me, Trevor.

                         TREVOR
               What do you mean?

                         JASMINE
               Don't ruin this holiday for me.

     Trevor goes quiet.

                         JASMINE (CONT'D)
               Are you still there?

                          TREVOR
               Yeah.

                         JASMINE
               Where are you?

                         TREVOR
               Where do you think. I'm on site.

                         JASMINE
               It doesn't sound like it...

     A BEAT.

                         TREVOR
               Babe, look I've got to go,

                         JASMINE
               Well what should I do about the
               car?

                         TREVOR
               Babe, I've gotta go, Bob's calling
               me... we'll talk about it later...
               I'll call you...

     CLICK! He puts down the phone.


82   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY

     Jasmine sits there for a moment, slightly distracted, then
     carries on painting with the kids, her mind elsewhere.
                                                          42.

83   EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE. DAY

     Shifty and Chris walk in silence. Chris looks about at the
     buildings, his eyes searching across the domain that he once
     knew so well.

                         CHRIS
               Did you tell Rachel?

                            SHIFTY
               What?

                            CHRIS
               About me.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY
               No, I didn't.

     A BEAT.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               I thought it'd be a surprise.

     Chris looks a little uncomfortable.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Mate, it's gonna be fine.

                         CHRIS
               Who else is gonna be there?

                         SHIFTY
               I dunno, lot of her new mates, I
               don't know many of them.

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS
               So what's the plan, are you gonna
               go and see your mum and dad first?

     Shifty looks at him.

                            SHIFTY
               No.

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS
               You should go man, see what they've
               got to say?

                         SHIFTY
               I thought you worked in
               recruitment.
                                                     43.

                    CHRIS
          What?

                    SHIFTY
          When do you become a fucking family
          liaison?

                    CHRIS
          What are you talking about you
          nutter, I was just saying?

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY
          I'll be stuck in some fucking
          warehouse... looking after twenty
          Bengalis... knocking out dodgy
          Fruit of the Looms.... I know
          exactly who they want me to meet,
          man.

                    CHRIS
          It might not be, mate, it might be
          some sweet little earner... in the
          city somewhere, do you know what I
          mean.

                    SHIFTY
          I've got a sweet little earner.

                    CHRIS
          Yeah, but you won't be sweating
          bullets everytime the door bell
          goes.

A BEAT.

                    CHRIS (CONT'D)
          You're not knocking out weed
          anymore, man.... This aint
          college... you're in deep bruv...
          that shit'll put you down for life.

                    SHIFTY
          Only if you get caught, mate.

Suddenly from around the corner we see someone come sprinting
past. .

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Malik?

Malik, small, Turkish, stops dead in his tracks and spins
round, he carries a large black holdall.
                                                44.

                      MALIK
              (OUT OF BREATH)
          Fucking hell Shifty... you alright
          bruv... I didn't even notice you.

                    SHIFTY
          What's going on?

                    MALIK
          Long story, geezer (Looks at Chris)
          you alright mate?

                    CHRIS
          How you doing?

                    SHIFTY
          Malik, this is an old mate of mine,
          Chris.

                    MALIK
          Someone's gotta be.

Chris laughs.

                    SHIFTY
          Where are you going, man why you
          running?

                    MALIK
          Fucking hell, do you remember I was
          telling you about Craig?

                    SHIFTY
          No.

                    MALIK
          Yeah you fucking do, Craig Whittle,
          the guy who's seeing Desmond
          Dodge's sister.

                    SHIFTY
          What, Craig, small Craig.

                     MALIK
          Yeah, yeah. D'you remember I told
          you he had that job at the
          pinnacles, the, erm, storage
          warehouse.

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah, go on.

He doesn't.
                                                          45.

                         MALIK
               Anyway, Craig tells me every
               Friday, on the fucking dot, a
               delivery gets made, all this top
               fucking electrical gear...

     Shifty offers him a cigarette.

                         MALIK (CONT'D)
               Cheers mate... yeah every Friday
               [lights his fag] they make this
               fucking drop off, but because the
               lorry can't reverse into the
               courtyard, something to do with the
               angle of the gates or something, I
               dunno mate, you'll have to ask
               Craig, they fucking, cos they can't
               get in, they leave all these crates
               sitting on the fucking road...

                         SHIFTY
               What... are you on your way there
               now?

                         MALIK
               What... no, no, no, I drummed the
               place ten minutes ago blood. This
               fucking... forklift went inside
               yeah, with this first load, so I,
               fucking, I nipped in, started
               whacking in the gear, only turns
               out they've got another forklift...

                         CHRIS
               Hold up, hold up...Why are you
               running?

                         MALIK
               Cunt caught me right in the middle
               a loading up.


     CLOSE ON: SHIFTY AND CHRIS' FACES DROP.

                         MALIK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Are you sure you don't want
               anything, I'll do you a proper
               deal, sort you right out?

     At that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes
     heading toward them. The siren blares out. Chris and Shifty,
     caught between a rock and a hard place, turn and sprint.


84   EXT. BACK STREETS. DAY

     Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but
     Shifty's like a whippet.
                                                          46.

                            SHIFTY
               Follow me.

     Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows.


85   EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY

     Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a
     wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in
     a shitty garden pond.

                            MALIK
               Fuck.


86   EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY

     Shifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind.

                         SHIFTY
               This is bollocks.

     Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the
     other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor
     hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.


87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY

     Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the
     crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are
     near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag
     whipping off the back.


     THE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE
     CYCLE TRACK.

     It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts
     cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more
     serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as
     Shifty.


88                                                                   *
     EXT. GROSVENOR ROAD CUT THRU. DAY.

     Shifty sits in an underpass. Random graffiti tarnishes the
     walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall. Chris
     is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard.

                         CHRIS
               Mate, I'm telling you, this is no
               way to live.

     Chris sits down next to Shifty.
                                                          47.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               I'm serious, mate, you need to get
               away from this shit, come and live
               with me for a bit.

     Shifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling
     out a pack of fags.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               I'm serious, mate... Why not?

     Shifty doesn't say anything.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               You'd love Manchester, man, it's
               full of fitness.

     Shifty stays quiet, and smokes. They sit their for a moment.

                         SHIFTY
               I can't just fuck off.

                         CHRIS
               Yeah, you can.

     Shifty looks at Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, but I wouldn't mate... I

               mate...CLICK!

     He stands there for moment, thinking. He walks over to
     Loretta and pulls back the sheets. He leans over and starts
     kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's
     licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse.

                         LORETTA
               Glen, I'm not in the mood.

     He doesn't listen, and pulls down her knickers.

     EXT. GROSVENOR ROAD CUT THRU. DAY

     There's a silence between the two of them. Shifty looks as if
     he's mulling something over in his head.

                         SHIFTY
               If Manchester's so full of gal, how

91   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     Trevor's makes his way through the lifeless avenues of
     Dudlowe, a repetitive New-York house tune plays out - Trevor
     does a line of coke off the tip of a credit card.

     In the distance we can hear the faint resonance of traffic
     and far-away cries from a children's playground....

                         CHRIS
               Did you go to the funeral?

     Shifty soaks in the question.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah of course I did.

                         CHRIS

               People were saying a lot of shit
               about both of us.

                            CHRIS
               Like what?

               bill?

                         SHIFTY
               Everyone did.

                         CHRIS
               What did people say when I left?
                                                 50.

                    SHIFTY
          I don't know mate. Whatever they
          were saying about you they were
          saying about me.

There's an uncomfortable silence between them.

                    CHRIS
          I'm gonna get fucking lick-shot
          tonight.

                       SHIFTY
          Fuck that.

                       CHRIS
          Why?

                    SHIFTY
          You always kick off.

               I gotta do one last drop off and we
               can chill out.


93   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     We see Trevor walk back to the van, in his hand he has a can
     of beer. Getting in, he settles down and begins to unwrap his
     gram of coke on the passenger seat. He places down the can to
     take a hit when suddenly he knocks it, spilling beer all over
     the cocaine.

                         TREVOR
               No, no, no, no, oh fuck, oh fucking
               hell.

     He's at it. His fingers dabbing at the clammy remnants,
     fingering it into his gums and teeth.

     Shifty's phone goes off on vibrate. He looks at the screen:
     TREVOR P MOB. He ignores it, rifles through his cellophane
     bag and pulls out three grams of coke.

                         SHIFTY
               What's work saying?

                          MALIK
                I don't think Shifty's gonna want
                to see me at the moment though
                Trev.

                          SHIFTY
                Ha Dee fucking Ha... wankers.

      Shifty sits back in his chair, thinking.

      Trevor scours the streets, Malik in the back. The house tune
      thumping out.


104   INT. BLAIR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAY

      Blair sniffs up a line of coke and offers some to Shifty and
      Chris who decline. The mellow tunes plays out. Chris passes
      the spliff to Blair who takes a deep drag. Shifty sits back
      and looks at the clock on the wall. It reads 18:45. He thinks
      for a moment. He looks at the lines of coke lined up on
      Blair's table. He looks back at the clock. 18:46. Chris is
      watching Shifty.

                          CHRIS
                I tell you what?

                          SHIFTY

                I could fucking smash one of your
                mum's curry's.

      Shifty looks at Chris straight in the eyes.

                          CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Do you think she would have made
                food?

                          SHIFTY

      Rez stands in the hallway of his parents house, we can see
      Shifty's parents in the kitchen chatting to an elderly
      gentleman in a suit. Rez looks at his phone, it reads: Shafiq
      Mobile. He looks at it for a while. Then answers.

                          SHIFTY (O.S.)
                Rez, it's Shifty

                            REZ
                Yeah.

                          SHIFTY (O.S.)
                Where are you?

                          REZ
                Mum and dads.


106   EXT. STREET. DAY

      Shifty and Chris walk.

                          SHIFTY
                You alright mate... you sound a bit
                down?

                            REZ (O.S.)
                I'm fine.

                          SHIFTY
                                                                      *
                Is that still job thing still on?

                          REZ (O.S.)
                Of course it is. Why wouldn't it
                be.

                          SHIFTY
                Alright mate, I was just asking.

                          REZ
                Just get here.


107   INT. SHIFTY'S PARENTS HOUSE / HALLWAY. DAY

      Rez puts down the phone. He stands there for a while,
      thinking, then walks into the kitchen to join his parents and
      their guest.


108   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

      Silence as Trevor and Malik drive. Suddenly Trevor notices
      Shifty and Chris walking down a grass verge, making their way
      beneath the underpass.
                                                              57.

      He brings the van to a halt at the side of the street. He
      exits the van, leaving Malik sitting in the back passenger
      seat slightly non-plussed.


109   EXT. UNDERPASS. DAY

      Shifty and Chris walk through the tunnel, from the far end we
      see the shadow of a heavyset man approaching. Shifty and
      Chris walk unfazed. Shifty recognises the guy.

                          SHIFTY
                    (under his breath)
                Oh shit!

      Trevor, appearing from the gloom, walks directly towards
      Shifty.

                          TREVOR
                Where you been geezer, I've been
                trying to get hold of you.

      He stops about a foot away from Shifty. Too close for
      comfort. Shifty takes a step back.

                          SHIFTY
                I've been busy, mate. You alright?

      Trevor assesses Chris.

                          TREVOR
                I need to get hold of some gear.

                          SHIFTY
                There's nothing left Trev, that's
                why I haven't answered?

      Trevor's face drops.

                          TREVOR
                    (Turning nasty)
                Don't fucking bullshit me Shifty.

                          SHIFTY
                Mate, call me in an hour and I`ll
                sort you out.

                          TREVOR
                You won't answer your phone mate,
                you've been blanking me all day.

                          SHIFTY
                Mate, I'm in a rush, I'll call you
                later.
                                                     58.

                    TREVOR
          Fuck off, I know you're carrying,
          don't try and mug me off.

                    SHIFTY
          Take it easy rude boy. Just chill
          out.

                    TREVOR
          I am fucking chilled out, I just
          don't like being mugged off, do you
          know what I mean?

Trevor's in Shifty's face.

                    SHIFTY
          I've had a long fucking day,
          Trevor, just leave me alone.

                    TREVOR
          Don't tell me what to fucking do
                                                               *
          you Paki.

He pushes Shifty hard. Chris steps up.

                    CHRIS
          Mate, leave it out!

Trevor's on Shifty and has him pinned up against the wall,
his hefty hand gripped around his neck, Suddenly he brings a
Stanley knife up to his temple.

                    TREVOR
          Empty your pockets! EMPTY YOUR
          FUCKING POCKETS.

                    CHRIS
          Mate what are you doing?

                    SHIFTY
          Just leave it, Chris. Trevor, think
          about what you're doing, man.

                    TREVOR
          JUST EMPTY YOUR FUCKING POCKETS.

Trevor edges the knife harder into Shifty's neck. Slowly
Shifty surrenders the large bag of coke and a cellophane bag
of crack with about two grand in cash.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Why do you lie to me you prick, why
          do you tell me you weren't fucking
          carrying.

                    SHIFTY
          Trevor, you need to calm down.
                                                           59.

      Trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife
      nestling at the tip of Shifty's Adams apple.

                          TREVOR
                Empty your fucking other
                                                                      *
                pockets!... NOW....NOW!

      Shifty does what Trevor says.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
                And the inside pockets you prick...
                NOW!

      At that moment, Trevor lowers his knife, Shifty takes heed
                                                                      *
      and grabs him, swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into
                                                                      *
      Trevor's face. They fall into a messy clinch, but their now
                                                                      *
      facing the opposite way. Chris and Shifty turn and sprint as
                                                                      *
      fast as possible. Trevor falls to his knees scrambling for
                                                                      *
      the drugs.

110   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONTROOM. DAY

      Jasmine is in the front room ironing. In front of her she has
      two suit cases laid out perfectly. She keeps and eye on the
      kids who are still painting. She presses one of Trevor's
      shirts perfectly.


111                                                                   *

      Shifty and Chris come to rest behind a gathering of bushes.
      Their lungs on fire as they grab for air. Shifty looks down
      at his top and realises he's bleeding.

                           SHIFTY
                Oh shit.

                          CHRIS
                Mate, are you alright?

      Chris reaches to help him, but Shifty swats away his hand.

                          SHIFTY
                Get off me, man.

                          CHRIS
                Mate, I'm only trying to help.

                          SHIFTY
                It's a bit fucking late now.

          Yeah exactly mate. Help might have
          been fucking nice, do you know what
          I mean?

                    CHRIS
          What was I supposed to do?

                    SHIFTY
          You're supposed to fucking help me,
          man, fucking do something.

                    CHRIS
          Mate, I'm sorry, I'm just not used
          to being fucking mugged in tunnels.
          It's not part of my daily routine?

                    SHIFTY
          I'm surprised you didn't do a
          fucking runner?

                    CHRIS
          What are you talking about?

                    SHIFTY

          run off and leave me to sort out
          the mess.

          Fuck you, Shifty. Fuck you, man.

                    SHIFTY
          Why, why, cos I'm speaking the
          truth. Talking about the past,
          talking about Serena. Oh no you
          can't talk about that, you mustn't

      INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

      Trevor gets back in the van, wiping the blood from his nose
      with the sleeve of his shirt and breathing heavily. He's
      counting the money, looking in the bag of drugs - PAY DIRT.
      He's a bundle of nervous energy.

                          VOICE
                    (off screen)
                Who d'you fucking rob - Cuba?

      Trevor spins round in his seat.

                JESUS MALIK... what are you doing?

                          MALIK
                I thought you wanted me to wait.

      Trevor starts to laugh; it's a nervous display, almost
      relief.
                                                           62.

                          TREVOR
                What's it worth?

      Malik considers, puts his hand in the bag and pulls out a
      camcorder he nicked earlier with a bunch of tapes.

      In a respectable dining room sit Shifty's parents and Mr.
      Ahmed. Their silence is awkward as they sit waiting for
      Shifty. Shifty's mum pours Mr. Ahmed some tea.


114                                                                  *
      INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DUSK

      Trevor takes out a wrap, places a huge pile on the end of a
      credit card and tries to snort the lot in one go. His broken
      nose proves difficult, blocked by clotted blood, so he eats
      the remainder.


115                                                                  *

                FUUUCK!!!

      Shifty's punching his bedroom door yelling out.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

      INT. SHIFTY'S PARENTS HOUSE. NIGHT

      Shifty's mum shuts the door as Mr. Ahmed leaves. She turns
      back into the hallway and suddenly begins to cry. Shifty's
      dad walks in and holds her tight, Rez holds back, not knowing
      what to do.


119   EXT. LONDON STREET. NIGHT

      Five heavy looking bastards walk out of a house and towards a
      serious looking black range rover. One of them opens the boot
      and they throw in baseball bats, a crowbar, masking tape.


120   EXT. HOUSE PARTY. NIGHT

      Chris sits on a wall the other side of the road, a carrier
      bag full of beer. He sits, drinking, just staring at the
      house, the music pumping from within. He watches as people
      arrive. He looks about. He's anxious, upset, he doesn't want
      to do this on his own.


121   INT. TREVOR'S FRONT ROOM. NIGHT

      Trevor unlocks the door and walks into the house, his nose
      swollen, face sullen, guilty. We follow as he walks toward
      the front room where we see suit cases placed over the floor
      as Jasmine busies herself packing. She doesn't look at
      Trevor, she's too angry with him.

                          TREVOR
                What are you doing babe?

                          JAMES
                What does it look like.

                          TREVOR
                We've got another three days yet?
                                                     64.

                     JASMINE
           I've got two kids to pack for...

Silence.

                     JASMINE (CONT'D)
           ...three including you...

                     TREVOR
           Where are they?

                     JASMINE
           Where do you think they are,
           they're in bed?

                     TREVOR
           What's wrong with you?

                      JASMINE
           Nothing.

Jasmine walks past him, still not looking him, and into the
kitchen where she takes wet washing from the machine.

                     TREVOR
           Babe, what's the matter?

She walks back past him to the front room.

                     JASMINE
           When did you start using again?

                      TREVOR
           What?

                     JASMINE
           When did you start using cocaine
           again?

                     TREVOR
           What are you talking about?

                     JASMINE
           I'm not going through this again
           Trevor, don't fucking lie to me.

                     TREVOR
           What are you going on about?

                     JASMINE
           Is that why the card failed.

                      TREVOR
           What?
                                                           65.

                          JASMINE
                I tried to book a car and the card
                failed?

                          TREVOR
                I told you not book it.

      She turns to look at him.

                           JASMINE
                I swore to you Trevor, I said to
                                                                      *

                your face.


122   INT. RANGE ROVER / MOTORWAY. NIGHT

      The five heavies sit in the car, heavy music playing out, the
      motorway lights flashing past.


123   INT. TREVOR'S FRONT ROOM. NIGHT

                          TREVOR

                scaffolding... cos coked off you're

                          TREVOR
                I'm not off my tits babe.

                          JASMINE
                What did I say to you Trevor, I
                said as god is my witness, I'll
                walk out of that door with my kids
                and never look back...

                           TREVOR
                Jasmine.

                          JASMINE
                What did I say?

                           TREVOR
                Babe.

                          JASMINE
                What did I fucking say.

      Trevor drops his head.
                                                            66.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                 You promised me you'd stopped, You
                 swore on your baby daughter's life
                 that you were clean, Trevor. You
                 swore on our nine-month old baby
                 daughter's life that you wouldn't
                 touch that... that shit anymore.

       Trevors starts crying.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                 No, don't you cry, don't you dare
                 fucking cry, because to me that's
                 even more repulsive. I want you to
                 be a man for Christ's sake. I want
                 you to be a fucking man about this,
                 Trevor, for once in your life take
                 control of the FUCKING situation.

       She's at him, screaming, hitting. He just stands there limp,
       absorbing her blows.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                 WE'RE YOUR FAMILY, YOU SHOULD BE
                 FUCKING LOOKING AFTER US YOU WEAK
                 USELESS PRICK.

       Jasmine walks away from him. Trevor's just left there,
       pathetic, alone.


124                                                                   *
       INT. REZ'S HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT

       We jump cut as Shifty cleans his cut, puts on a fresh tee
                                                                      *
       shirt, freshens his face in the sink.

       Shifty is then down in the kitchen, at the washing machine.
       He pulls out the powder tray, nothing there, he's digging
       about inside, he gets a torch, he's trying to peer in,
       frantic.

                           REZ (OS)
                 Where the FUCK have you been?

       Shifty's head darts. They stare at each other for a moment.

                           SHIFTY
                 Rez, I'm sorry, man.

                           REZ
                 Where the fuck have you been... why
                 didn't you phone mum and dad?

       Rez walks into the kitchen.
                                                      67.

                     SHIFTY
           I ran out of juice.

                     REZ
           Why didn't you use a pay phone?

Shifty doesn't answer. Rez looks at the open tray on the
washing machine. Shifty look him in the eye.

                     SHIFTY
           I need it Rez, where is it?

                     REZ
                                                               *
           Where is it? Where the fuck is it.
           You bring drugs into my fucking
           house... the house that I pray
           in...

He pushes Shifty hard in the chest.

                     SHIFTY
           Rez, Rez, man.

                     REZ
           I looked after you Shifty, I took
           you under my roof, let you live in
           my house, and this, this is how you
           repay me...

Rez pushes Shifty again hard. Shifty grabs Rez but Rez
punches him around the face, they fall to the floor in a
messy clinch, Rez pulling at shifty's face, hitting him.

                     SHIFTY
           Rez, Rez, Rez...

Shifty   manages to wrangle himself free. Rez is up and at
him.

                     REZ
           Get out of my fucking house, get
           out...

                                                               *
                     SHIFTY
           Rez, Rez, I need that bag...

                      REZ
           Get out.

                     SHIFTY
           Rez, if you don't give it to me I'm
           a dead man.

Rez storms off upstairs. Shifty stands just rubbing his face
with his hands muttering under his breath.
                                                            68.

                           SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                 Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
                 fuck...

                                                                       *
       He can hear Rez rustling about upstairs. Shifty starts
                                                                       *
       ascending the stairs.

       Shifty's enters the bathroom to see Rez emptying the drugs
       into the toilet.

                                                                       *
                             SHIFTY
                 REZ, NO!

                             REZ
                 Fuck you.

                             SHIFTY
                 REZ!

       Rez flushes the chain. Shifty pushes Rez aside and reaches
       into the toilet but it's too late.

                           SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                 What the fuck have you done, what
                 the FUCK have you done?

                           REZ
                 Get the FUCK out.

                             SHIFTY
                 Rez.

                           REZ
                 Get the FUCK out of my house.

       Rez is pushing Shifty again. Shifty backs away down the
       steps.


125    INT. RANGE ROVER / MOTORWAY. NIGHT

       The motorway lights flicker through the glass, illuminating
       the guys faces. One of them rotates a knife in his hand.


126    EXT. REZ'S HOUSE. NIGHT

       Shifty exits his brothers house. He stands there for a moment
       breathing hard, thinking, then heads off with conviction.
                                                           69.

127   INT. TREVOR'S FRONT ROOM. NIGHT

      Jasmine, still in a bit of a state, her eyes reddened from
      tears, sits sorting stuff out in the front room. She picks up
      the carrier bag that Trevor brought home with him and looks
      inside, she pulls out the camera and tapes.


128   EXT. TREVOR'S GARDEN. NIGHT

      Trevor sits at the garden table smoking a fag. Jasmine walks
      outside.

                          JASMINE
                What's this?

      Trevor looks up.

                          TREVOR
                I brought it for you.

      He walks past her back into the house and kisses her cheek
      she flinches slightly, She stands there for a second soaking
      it in.


129   EXT. HOUSE PARTY. NIGHT

      Chris sits on the wall, he downs his beer, straightens
      himself up, and walks towards the house. A voice calls out.

                          SHIFTY (O.S.)
                CHRIS!

      Chris turns to see Shifty approaching. They stand there for a
      moment. Neither one saying anything.

                          CHRIS
                You alright?

                          SHIFTY
                Yeah, I'm alright. You alright.

      Chris looks down.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                Look man, I'm not gonna do this
                party...

      Chris nods.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                I've got too much shit to deal
                with.

      A BEAT.
                                                           70.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                You don't have to come with me.
                It's up to you?

                          CHRIS
                Yeah, cool, I'll probably just grab
                my stuff from yours then.

      Shifty nods with acceptance, but Chris smiles.

                          CHRIS (CONT'D)
                As if I'm not gonna come with you
                nutter.

      Shifty shakes is head.

                          SHIFTY
                Fucking hell, man. I thought you
                were gonna leave me cold.

                          CHRIS
                I thought you were used to it.

                          SHIFTY
                There's only so much one man can
                take.

      They walk off. Chris throws Shifty a light punch.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                Now you start throwing punches.

      Quietly Trevor sniffs up a corner of coke. He carefully opens
      the door to make sure Jasmine's not nearby. He exits and we
      follow him into the front room where Jasmine sits with the
      Camcorder. She aims it at Trevor and presses record. Jasmine
      peers into the Lens.


131                                                                   *
      INT. COUNCIL ESTATE / HALLWAY. NIGHT

      Shifty and Chris approach a rundown council flat. The door is
      shabby, black bin liners decorate the floor. Shifty knocks.
      They stand for a moment when suddenly the door creaks open to
      reveal Loretta peaking through.

                          SHIFTY
                Loretta, is Glen there?

      She watches them for a moment then shuts the door. Shifty
      looks at Chris. They stand for a moment when Glen opens the
      door.
                                                           71.

                             GLEN
                Shifty.

                          SHIFTY
                Alright mate.

                             GLEN
                What?

                           SHIFTY
                I need to talk to you about
                something.

      Glen just looks at him.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                Can we do it inside.

      Glen opens the door. They both walk into the flat. Glen stops
      shifty and points for him to go into the bedroom.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                    (to chris)
                Mate, I'll only be a minute.

      Chris walks into the front room where he sees Lenny and
      Loretta playing Connect 4.

      He looks at Lenny.

                          CHRIS
                Alright mate.

      Lenny looks slowly up.

                             LENNY
                Alright.

      Chris perches himself on the edge of a dusty old armchair. He
      looks at Loretta.

                          CHRIS
                You alright Loretta.

      She smiles at him.

                          LORETTA
                You alright Chris.

      He smiles nervously.


132   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. NIGHT

                          GLEN
                What's going on, what are you
                fucking doing here?
                                                 72.

                    SHIFTY
          Something happened today...

          serious... so I phoned Magnus...

                    SHIFTY
          Who told you that?

                    GLEN
          Magnus did.

                    SHIFTY
          And what did he say?

                    GLEN
          That you've lost all his gear...
          all of his money.

Shifty pauses thinking.

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah well he went mental, saying
          some other shit about me cutting it
          up, mixing the coke, he was saying
          all sorts of... bullshit...

Glen stays quiet. Shifty waits for a reaction.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Why would he be saying that...
          who's been talking to him?

A BEAT.

                    GLEN
          Dunno mate, you're guess is as good
          as mine.

Shifty pulls out his phone.

                    SHIFTY
          Perhaps you should phone him up
          now, here, in front of me, tell him
          it's all bollocks.

Glen just looks at Shifty.

                    GLEN
          You can tell him yourself.
                                                       73.

      Shifty holds the phone to Glen's face.

                          SHIFTY
                Go on mate, call him up, tell him
                that I don't cut up the coke.

      Glen knocks down Shifty's arm.

                          GLEN
                I don't know what the fuck you do
                Shifty?

      Chris watches Loretta and Glen play connect 4.


134   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. NIGHT

                          GLEN
                Mugging off Magnus, saying that
                he's getting weak, losing all his
                gear...

                          SHIFTY
                What the FUCK are you going about.

                          GLEN
                And then you come to my house and
                you threaten me...

      Shifty stays quiet.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
                ...Shooting off your fucking mouth,
                telling me what you're gonna do to
                Magnus... telling me how you're
                gonna take him down...

      Shifty stares at Glen, seething.
                                                           74.

      Lenny and Loretta, having ditched the connect 4, are chasing
      the dragon from a piece of tin foil. Chris looks totally
      uneasy, the situation is making him uncomfortable.


136   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. NIGHT

                          SHIFTY
                You've been chopping up the fucking

                to the fucking Turks, cutting out
                Magnus.

      A BEAT. Glen looks a little shocked by Shifty's revelation.

                          GLEN
                Who told you that?

                            SHIFTY
                Fuck you.

                          GLEN
                Fuck you, you cunt. You're just
                jealous cos you didn't think of it
                first. You're not that fucking
                smart.

                          SHIFTY
                I didn't think of it, cos I'm not
                that fucking stupid.

      There's a knock at the door. Shifty hesitates, then answers
      it.

                          CHRIS
                Mate, can we go?

                          SHIFTY
                Don't worry about it, I'm fucking
                leaving.

      Shifty goes to walk out with Chris. Glen follows them into
      the corridor.

                          GLEN
                It's about time you both fucked
                off.

                          SHIFTY
                Fuck off Glen.

                          GLEN
                After what happened.

      Shifty and Chris carry on walking out.
                                                           75.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
                No wonder you left mate.

                            CHRIS
                What?

                          GLEN
                Couldn't show your face after what
                you did.

                          CHRIS
                What did I do exactly.

                          GLEN
                Get the fuck out of my house.

                          CHRIS
                What the fuck did I do?

                          SHIFTY
                Mate, just leave it the geezers a
                wanker.

                          CHRIS
                WHAT DID I FUCKING DO?

                          GLEN
                Don't start shouting mate.

                            CHRIS
                FUCK YOU?

                          GLEN
                Or what... you gonna kill me like
                you did Serena.

      Suddenly, with out hesitation Chris grabs Glen by his tee
      shirt and slams his forehead into Glens nose. It breaks in a
      clean crack, blood spurting out. Glen doubles over, holding
      his face. Chris smashes his fist into the back of Glens head,
      Glen goes down on his knees. Chris is kicking him. Shifty
      comes in and pulls him away, laying in a few boots himself.

      Glen stands up.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
                You broke my fucking nose. You're a
                fucking dead man Shifty... you're
                all ready a fucking dead, man,
                                                                      *

      Shifty and Chris cross a field, trudging through the ankle
      length grass. They reach a hedge. Shifty reaches into the
      bushes and starts rummaging around. He pulls out a black bin
      liner containing something heavy. He unwraps one bin liner to
      reveal another which has been tied with elastic. He undoes
      another black bin liner until finally he's left with just a
      leather sports bag.

                Where are we going?

                now, go to Manchester, tonight, I'm

                Chris I can't. I'm not leaving...

                          CHRIS
                Yeah but she didn't did she.

      Shifty leans forward and opens the leather sports bag. He
      pulls out a .38 six shot revolver and a hand full of bullets.
      He starts loading the gun. Chris stands up.

                           CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Jesus Christ man what the fuck are
                you doing?

      Shifty gestures for him to be quiet, and points upstairs to
      his bother.

                          CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Fucking hell, man, this is
                bullshit.

                Chris sit down, man.

      Chris sits down. Shifty reaches in the bag and hands him a
      knuckle duster. Chris looks at it.

                          CHRIS
                Glad you're fucking sorted.

                Do you think they'll come.

                          SHIFTY
                Don't know.

      A moment of silence.

                          CHRIS
                Wish I'd slept last night.

      A BEAT.

                          CHRIS (CONT'D)
                I'm fucked.

      Shifty nods. He's feeling the pain.

                          CHRIS (CONT'D)
                Got any coke?

                             SHIFTY
                I'm out.

      Silence. Chris laughs.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                We've been chased by the police...

      Chris' laughter increases.

                          CHRIS
                We got fucking mugged...

      They're both starting to laugh.
                                                           79.

                And my brother flushed my gear down
                the toilet...

      They're both cracking up.

                          SHIFTY (CONT'D)
                Party was blinding though weren't
                it?

      They're both laughing, Shifty motions for them to quieten
      down in case they wake Rez.

                           CHRIS
                Fuck the party. I never wanted to
                go anyway.

      Chris is falling asleep, head drooping. Shifty's trying to
      stay awake, one eye open, struggling, but he's too tired.
      Both their heads are drooped, they're dead to the world.

      CAMCORDER: Jasmine peers into the lens. She then turns the
      camera and follows Trevor who plants himself on the other
      settee, he looks uneasy.

                          TREVOR
                Babe, do me a favour.

      There is a colossal banging sound.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
                What the fuc...

      Trevor's up on his feet. The banging becomes a crash as
      something gives way.

                          JASMINE
                TREVOR WHAT IS IT? PHONE THE
                POLICE!

      Three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room.
      Jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still
      giving a viewpoint on events. Three men are on Trevor, he's
      receiving a serious beating.

      THE MUSIC ON THE SOUND TRACK BEGINS TO GET LOUDER.

      A man grabs Jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle
      of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever. This
      is bedlam. Suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays
      a vicious right hook to Trevor's head. He goes down like a
      lead weight. Jasmine's crying, fear washing over her. A child
      cries out from upstairs.

                            VOICE (OS)
                Tell that fucking slag to stop
                crying... NOW!!

      Two hooded men drag Jasmine off to another room. She's
      fighting back clawing at them. Trevor's face is pressed
      against the cold lino flooring. Someone has grabbed the
      camera and angles it on Trevor's bloodied features. Congealed
      blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities.
                                                              84.

      A hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face, squeezing
      his cheeks so he looks sadly comic. Trevor's eyes flicker
      open.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Look into the lens...

      Trevor fails to comply. The hand slaps him hard and grabs his
      face again.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Look into the FUCKING lens!!!

      Trevor complies.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Say you're sorry.

      Trevor begins to weep - a painful sight.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                SAY YOU'RE FUCKING SORRY!!!

      The voice echoes out.

      to shoulder.

      The music rises.


      CUT TO BLACK.

                              
                              THE END
