                         FADE IN:

                         BEFORE TITLES:
          The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a
          single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes
          faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow
          streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,
          confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us
          and another, and as our surroundings become more
          visible, we discover that we are moving through a
          pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.
          suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves
          on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

          It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen
          Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at
          lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move
          toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past
          the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard
          dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main
          house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by
          a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named
          Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.
          As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the
          car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom
          Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business
          suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house
          and looks off.

          HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE
          Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.
          Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed
          for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-
          ward us.

          REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY
           As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he
           is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to
           keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the
          background, by the house 9 After a moment:

          Time to go.
          There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and
          moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen.

          EXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY

          The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane
          and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary,
          about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for
          travelling. As they put her into the car --

          No. Ere wanted me to tell you both
          how sorry he was.

                         (TO CONNIE)
          Aunt Connie ..- ?
          Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any
          questions.

                         CONNIE

          Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to--
          ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17"s

                         TEE DRIVEWAY
          Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down
          the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie,
          Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto-
          matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The
          Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine
          passes through.
          TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE
          As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going
          back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up-
          ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
          Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one
          hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine,
          his expression unreadable-but somehow sad.

          ZNT. AIRLMPR - DAY
          We are close on Tony, looking out the window of the
          airliner, his own expression matching that of his

          Under its fanlight, the front door swings open and

          EXT. NAVY AIM MA.RI Z CORPS STADIUM - DAY

          We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone),
          in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
          at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --
          who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State --
          continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.

          • CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE
          -- there are no limits to the goals
          to which we can each legitimately
          aspire. And now, as an unpopular war
          is ended in East Asia and we set our
          sights on new goals, I leave you with
          the words of another Sailor ---
          We continue to pull back to discover that we are at
          the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring
          day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The
          Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered
          for- the graduation ceremonies.

                         GRQNDELLIIIS
          ' Our will is to keep the torch of
          freedom burning for all. To this
          solemn purpose we call on the young,
          the brave and the strong, and the
          free. Heed my call. Come to the

          During this speech we find we have been. moving through
          the stadium. We find Tony's mother, Ray, among the
          guests. We also see Tony's sister, Mary, about twenty,
          Tom Hagen and Al Neri.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The speech is over and as the audience applauds, the

          television personality, mainly an interviewer of
          celebrities, although sometime a Newsweman and talk-
          show performer. She is poised, attractive, warm,
          hirp. She is coming out of an office. She crosses
          through the newsroom with its teletypes and general
          sense of activity. A Cameraman comes up to her:

          natious face wreathed in a grin, camas cut of the
          prison gate, his hands held up in the "Victory" sign.
          He pushes his way through the Television Cameramen
          and Newsmen, not saying anything.
          We pan him over to a limousine which he gets into
          quickly. The limousine drives off.

                         NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
          Today in Leavenworth, Kansas, one--
          time International Brotherhood of
          Dockworkers' President, Danny DeVito
          i was. released. on pardon after serving
          six and. a half years of a fifteen
          year sentence an embezzlement and
          conspiracy charges. DeVito didn't
          state his future plans, but insiders
          expect him to challenge the incum-
          bent President, Pat Brady, in the up-
          coming election.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Tony comes into the room, Palmateer gives him a

          until the cock crows thrice.
          As Tony is signing the papers, Palmateer has produced
          a service automatic from a canvas carryi+:g case. He
          puts it on the table before Tony ---

          As a large car pulls up and stops in front of Tony,
          he opens the door and gets into the backseat. We

          As Croce sets the briefcase on his lap, Tony reaches
          into his pocket and gives him the key. Now Croce

          Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as. Tony, in a
          lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the
          Man's head.
          As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a

          You were running a no-lose operation.
          if we succeeded, you were rid of
          Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone
          family was set up to take the blame.
          Your hands were clean. I was the
          only one who could dispute your
          story and I wasn't supposed to come
          back. I've found out that my res-
          ignation from the Navy was processed
          and accepted a full week before I
          went down here ---

          It's not blackmail. It's a simple
          statement of fact. If anything
          happens to me or if the Corleone

          aboard. a nice little yawl, apparently his own.

                         CLOSER
          as Morehouse goes to the cabin. The snap lock has
          been unlocked and the hatchway is open. There is a
          dim light in the cabin.

          1 T. CAS= - NIGHT
          as Morehouse comes down the four steps that lead into
          the cabin, then stops.

          Palmateer and Rocco Lampone are waiting for him in the
          cabin.

          as Rocco rises, drawing a twenty-two calibre pistol
          with silencer, and shoots Morehouse three times in
          the chest.
          As Morehouse goes down:

                         LAMPONE
          Is he dead?
          Palmateer kneels to check Morehouse.

          So are you.

          As Morehouse's sailboat drifts in the calm, it's
          sails up and motionless, it's tiller untended. The
          patrol boat noses up:

          leaving or standing in knots, gossiping.
          We pick up Elizabeth and Tony as they cross out, pausing
          to speak with Senator Geary and Grundellius who have
          stopped to chat.

          We pick up the headlights of a car coming up the
          long approach driveway toward us. It comes past
          the gate, past the kennels for the guard dogs, past
          the guest houses and finally up to the main house
          where it stops.
          The front door to the house opens and Michael stands
          silhouetted against the block of yellow light. Tony
          gets out of the car and comes up to him. They embrace
          briefly and move into the house together.
          As the door closes behind them, we start to move up
          and back. The sound of the single trumpet can still
          be heard, playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly
