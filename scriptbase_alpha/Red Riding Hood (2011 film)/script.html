<b>                                               REVISED FIRST DRAFT
</b>                                                     July 16, 2009

                         

                         

<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          Did you hear that?

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          The innkeeper told me --

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

<b>                         OLD KNIGHT
</b>          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

<b>                         OLD KNIGHT
</b>          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

<b>                         FAT KNIGHT
</b>          What the devil are you --?!

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

<b>                         TEENAGE BOY
</b>          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED: (2)
</b>          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
</b>
          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-
          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

<b>          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

<b>                         LUCIE
</b>          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even
          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark
          contrast to her squalid surroundings.
          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

<b>                         CARPENTER
</b>          Hey, there! Let one of these
          young lads get that for you.

          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.

<b>          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY
</b>
          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

<b>                         CESAIRE
</b>          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I'm taking a break.

<b>                         WOODCUTTER BOSS
</b>          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

<b>          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY
</b>
          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,
          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes
          her in his arms, kissing her. She holds him tight.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I was afraid you weren't coming.

<b>                         ISABELLE

</b>          He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
          her eyes, smiles up at him. Touches his face.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I think my sister's starting to
          suspect something.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Do you think she'll tell your
          father?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to
          know. Besides, my father likes
          you.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Of course he does. Right up until
          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          What's going on?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          You haven't heard?
          (off her look)
          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Was it the Wolf?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Could it have been anything else?
          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

          my sewing lessons next week.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          You really think you can go all
          day without seeing me?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I'll manage somehow. Pride is a
          cardinal sin, by the way.

</b>          I can think of worse sins I could

          Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
          hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She
          applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes
          it 'œdisappear,'� then smiles big and runs away.
          A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look.

<b>                         LUCRECE

          cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical,
          serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious).
          A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look
          tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.

          The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through

          The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as

          Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
          contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at

          well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it.
          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace

          All the girls are paying close attention now, but
          Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle.

          The four girls return to the village along the forest
          path. Waiting for them is Peter. Isabelle pretends to
          not notice him. As they pass, he calls out to her:

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I need to talk to you.
          Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          What about?
          Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
          sees that the other girls have stopped to watch.
          Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and
          leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          When were you planning on telling
          me?

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Telling you what?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          That you're engaged to be married
          to Henri Smith.
          Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Henri Smith? Is this a joke?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Look at me. Just look at me and
          tell me you didn't know.
          She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Who told you this?

          were outsiders.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Why? Because they hadn't lived
          here since Noah built the ark?

</b>          You mind your tongue.
          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.

          getting married in the spring,
          it's me.
          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the

</b>          We knew Isabelle was going to be
          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her
          to simply do as she's told. She's
          too much like her grandmother.

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.

          This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the

          Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls
          exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on.

</b>          My goodness. I had no idea our
          young people were so woefully
          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the
          Bold even visited here once. But
          that, of course, was before the
          Wolf came.
          The girls listen attentively.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          Your parents fear the Wolf because
          they remember when it did kill
          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began
          to spread that we were cursed.
          That was when our village began to
          die. And that was why my husband
          led a group of men into the woods
          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.
          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          After that, people here didn't
          have much stomach to go hunting
          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us
          alone ever since.

          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

</b>          She's right. It's not fair. I

          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

<b>          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT

          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER

          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

          fourteenth century, this place would have been on the
          wrong side of them.
          Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
          long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a
          surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears.

          Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
          can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's
          standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.

<b>                         ROSEMARIA
</b>          No. You can't.
          She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives

          Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except
          for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria
          gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have
          gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle.

          But then that would defeat the
          purpose. People only change when
          things are difficult.

          away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then

          adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees
          Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and
          leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse.

          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle
          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.
          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,
          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When
          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks

          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.
          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,

          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,
          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the
          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The

          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it
          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are
          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him
          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --
          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.

          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a
          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.
          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time
          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary

          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves
          CRUNCH under their feet...
          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.
          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,
          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.

          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark
          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...
          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they

          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The

          wall to keep from falling...
          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep
          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop
          himself, and then --
          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.
          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.
          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning
          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood
          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.
          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...
          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's
          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood
          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --
          -- just as the wolf attacks.

          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing
          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.
          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and
          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or
          failure. But as they near...
          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike
          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,
          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle
          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.
          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back
          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and
          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses

          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to

</b>          I've found that there's no burden
          that doesn't at least seem a

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't know what to do. She
          wants me to pretend like I don't
          know. How am I supposed to go on
          living in that house?

          Too much hate will eat you alive.
          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
          shoulder.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and
          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

<b>          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

<b>                         CESAIRE
</b>          You're a good girl.
          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
          chest, and leaves.

          Prudence.

</b>          It's strange, isn't it? You think
          because things have been a certain
          way your whole life that they'll
          always be the same. Then
          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked
          it up and put it in my sack.

          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.

          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain
          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the
          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is

          It did kill your blacksmith. But
          the animal that you killed was not
          the werewolf.

          werewolf most likely wounded it
          earlier in the evening and left it
          in the cave for you to find and

          not live in the forest as you have
          rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives
          here in the village. Among you.
          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.

          Men play MUSIC and couples dance. Roxanne dances with

</b>          Get to the church, you fools!
          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>
<b>          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S
</b>
<b>          HOLY LOVE!
</b>          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.
          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Where's Claude? Where is he?!

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

<b>          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT
</b>
          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

<b>          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

<b>          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

<b>          ROXANNE (O.S.)
</b>          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

</b>          You have to stop it. He can't
          hear you and you are going to get
          us killed. Do you understand me?
          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Come on!
          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being
          impolite, Isabelle?

<b>                         ISABELLE

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Isabelle...?
          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

</b>          I want you, Isabelle.
          Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Leave with me tonight. Run with
          me. The only shackles binding you
          are of your own making. Slip them
          and I can show you the world and
          every pleasure in it.
          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't know who you are, but we
          are not the same. I would rather
          die than go with you.

          Do you think she would rather die?
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Come away with me. Or I will kill
          her. And I will keep killing
          until you agree to leave with me.
          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Choose now. Quickly.
          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          Your silence has doomed them all.
          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:

</b>          Come the next full moon, their
          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne

</b>          No. It only growled.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          You heard it talk to you?
          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to

          Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
          Solomon's iron grip on his arm. Solomon and his Captain
          go to Soldier #1. Solomon kneels at his side.

<b>                         SOLOMON

          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
          into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.

          A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
          cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to

          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

<b>          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

<b>                         PETER

          Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I meant everything I said. This
          isn't what I wanted.

</b>          Of course not. You'd better go
          home and see to your mother.
          She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
          the door, but he doesn't look at her. She leaves.

<b>          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
          Attewater and Father Auguste.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Silver. This is our most potent
          weapon. One blow will kill it.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          That sword has tasted the blood of
          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          If it's that powerful, how can we
          possibly hope to stop it?

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          We must find it in its human form.
          Who among you do you suspect?
          Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
          Neither of them wants to speak up first.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but
          we must start somewhere.

<b>                         FATHER AUGUSTE

<b>                         SOLOMON

          hair to make us think that.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

<b>                         FATHER AUGUSTE
</b>          The curse is hereditary?

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          It is. But it effects men and
          women differently. A man can
          inherit the curse. Or he can be
          turned simply by being bitten.
          Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          But women are immune to the
          werewolf's bite. In order for a
          woman to be turned, she must
          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>          But it could be a woman.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER

          Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is

          An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
          that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob.
          Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way
          through the crowd.

<b>                         ISABELLE

          She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as

          Yes. But I don't believe he meant
          anything by it. It was in jest.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          So you consider the black mass to

          Certain devils called incubi can
          collect human semen and then
          transfer it to women as they
          sleep. A woman who unwittingly
          conceives in this manner would not

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          We have proven here today that
          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the
          accused has refused to confess,
          this court calls upon its final
          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.
          Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.

<b>          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

          Isabelle stands before Solomon. Claude waves. She
          ignores him.

</b>          On the night of the last full
          moon, you were attacked by the
          Wolf. You looked it in the eye.
          And the one thing a werewolf can
          never change is its eyes.

          you see the beast in them?
          Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
          expectant. Then:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          It isn't him. It can't be. He
          was with us when the Wolf
          attacked.
          Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.

<b>                         SOLOMON

</b>          He was there! He carried Claude
          away! He saved his life!
          Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
          back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.

<b>                         CARPENTER
</b>          She is mistaken. I did no such
          thing.
          Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
          but no one will speak up. Solomon frowns.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Very well. Since no one here can
          bear witness, we must extort a

          Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
          Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen
          to me? Doesn't he care that
          Claude isn't guilty?

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          He'd rather let an innocent boy
          die than risk letting the Wolf go
          free.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          But the Wolf is free. And the
          moon will be full in two days.
          The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
          close, lowers her voice.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          We both know it will be coming for

          and never return.

</b>          I cannot leave.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          You have no choice. The
          alternative is unthinkable.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          What is unthinkable is that I
          should be responsible for the
          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          The Wolf's sins are on its own
          twice-damned soul, not yours.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          But what if it was you it wanted?
          Would you go with it to save me?
          Or would you leave me to die?
          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
          night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.

<b>                         CESAIRE
</b>          You should have condemned him
          today. At least it would have
          been quick.
          Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
          Grandmother continue to listen.

          Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears,
          trying to block out the SCREAMING. Her mother sits by
          the fire as if nothing unusual is going on.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          How can you just sit there and
          listen to this?
          Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
          grabs Marguerite's coin purse.

<b>                         MARGUERITE
</b>          Where are you going with that?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Don't you touch me again. Ever.

          A fire burns underneath a 'œBrazen Bull,'� a hollow, life-
          size bull made of brass. The fire heats the metal to

<b>                         SOLOMON

          flesh of pregnant women and eat
          their unborn children.

          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the

          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.

          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She
          cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life...

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Spare my brother and I will tell
          you her name.

          SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their
          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.
          Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away.

<b>          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind
          her. She huddles against the wall, shivering.

          looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...
          It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body
          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle
          chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly
          takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him.

<b>          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY
</b>
          The chamber is full again. Cesaire, Grandmother,
          Prudence, and Henri are here. Peter sits in the last
          row. Isabelle is in the seat of the accused. Roxanne
          stands witness. She's trying not to look at Isabelle.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          How are you acquainted with the
          accused?

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          We were friends.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          And how long did this friendship
          last?

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          All my life.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          And in this time, have you ever
          known the accused to converse with
          devils?

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Yes, Your Eminence. On the night
          of the last full moon, she talked
          to the werewolf. And later she
          told me that it also talked to
          her.
          Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
          clenches his fist. Solomon turns to Isabelle.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          What of this? Do you deny having
          conversed with a werewolf?
          She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:

          only if I leave with it.
          Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
          over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:

          The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
          gives Attewater a dark look. Then:

<b>                         LUCRECE
</b>          The first victim was her sister.
          The second was her fiancÃ©e's

          Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on

          (off Isabelle's look)
          I am the oldest person in this
          village who was here when the Wolf
          first came. I remember the old
          days. And what is happening now
          is much worse.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          What was it like in the old days?

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          The Wolf never used to attack in
          the open like it did at the
          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          It's grown bold.

<b>                         GRANDMOTHER
</b>          Or perhaps it made a mistake.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          You're at the center of this. At
          least two of the victims can be
          tied to you. What if it had to

          hide the fact that the first two

          Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
          door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside --

</b>
          -- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She
          startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look.

<b>                         CESAIRE
</b>          Are you ready for me to take you
          home?
          She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
          holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly
          hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look.

          Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The
          moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence
          with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece.

</b>          Stop the cart.
          Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:

</b>          Prudence, come with me. I have
          some blankets I want you to mend

          He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind
          him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She
          puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing...

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

<b>                         THE FIGURE

          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.

          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

<b>                         ROXANNE
</b>          Are you sure you don't want us to
          bring you something?

<b>                         THE FIGURE
</b>          No, my dear. Come back tomorrow.
          The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't
          see the blood pour outside under the door behind her.

          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a

</b>          Of course.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I wanted to say... I don't know
          what to say.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          You don't have to say anything.

<b>                         PRUDENCE
</b>          I want to.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

<b>                         PRUDENCE
</b>          Yes. It won't be long now.

<b>          ACROSS THE SQUARE
</b>          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

<b>          HENRI (O.S.)
</b>          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Get away from me!

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I'm trying to get you out of this.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

<b>                         CAPTAIN
</b>          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

<b>                         ATTEWATER
</b>
<b>          RUN!
</b>          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

<b>                         CAPTAIN

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          It's gone.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

<b>                         REEVE
</b>          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

          sacrificed you to save themselves?

</b>          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

<b>          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
</b>          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          There is your mighty werewolf
          hunter. Who will save you now?

<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          You bastard! You killed my
          father!

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Henri, what are you doing?

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

<b>                         MERCHANT
</b>          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

</b>          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

<b>                         THE WOLF
</b>          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

<b>                         HENRI
</b>          Are you all right?
          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

<b>          SOLOMON (O.S.)
</b>          This isn't over.
          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

<b>                         SOLOMON
</b>          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's
          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.

<b>          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.
          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          It's past noon.

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          I know. I didn't want to wake
          you.
          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          He'll be home soon. They have no
          reason to hold him any longer.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Did they catch the Wolf?

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          No. They lost it in the forest.
          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          What about Grandmother?
          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.

<b>                         SUZETTE
</b>          Roxanne came by. She said your
          grandmother has fallen ill. I was
          hoping you could look in on her.
          Off Isabelle's troubled look...

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red
          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower
          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping
          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.
          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops
          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the
          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.
          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Thank God you're all right.
          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help
          me.

          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Those people back there. I know
          they mean well, but they're just
          people. I didn't expect anything
          from them. I expected something
          from you.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I just need to talk to you.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I'm going to see my Grandmother.
          She's sick. Please don't follow
          me.
          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,
          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She
          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...
          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks
          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...
          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.

<b>          EXT. GULLY - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten
          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks
          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges
          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,
          holding onto the rope with both hands...
          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At
          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken
          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to
          catch her breath before continuing...

          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the
          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She
          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Grandmother? Are you awake?
          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:

<b>          THE FIGURE (O.S.)
</b>          Pull the bobbin. The latch will
          open.
          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...

<b>          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK

          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.

<b>                         REEVE
</b>          You're certain nobody has seen him
          since last night?

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          The Wolf must have taken him.
          What else could have done that?
          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK
</b>
          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the
          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It
          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.
          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond
          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is
          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.
          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.

<b>                         THE FIGURE

          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

<b>                         THE FIGURE
</b>          I'm not hungry right now.

          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I came here to take care of you.
          Not the other way around.

</b>          Don't be silly, my dear. You've
          been through so much. Sit down.
          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

<b>                         THE FIGURE

          looks up from its grooming, watching her...

</b>          That's right. Eat up, my dear.
          Eat up.
          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.

<b>                         ISABELLE

          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a
          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks
          of white meat...

<b>                         ISABELLE

          on the table to wash it down.
          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

          rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          115.

<b>          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The cottage is dark and quiet.

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          It's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door.

<b>          PETER (O.S.)
</b>          Hello?
          No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
          opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal
          Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's
          screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger
          and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do.

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          Isabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle
          provides the only light. A long beat.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          People should know what he was.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          We can't tell anyone. If they
          don't believe you, they'll hang
          you for this. And if they do
          believe you, they'll hang you for
          being the daughter of the Wolf.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Then I'll run away. I was ready
          to run away last night.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Why didn't you come for me?
          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a
          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I was bitten at the festival. I
          spent last night in the woods
          because I was afraid of what might
          happen...

<b>                         (A BEAT)
</b>          I changed. I'm like him now.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          No, you're not. You could never
          be like him.

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          116.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I can't stay here.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Yes, you can. We can still be
          together. My father lived here.
          My grandfather lived here.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Your father and your grandfather
          killed people. They couldn't help
          themselves. If I stay here, I
          won't be able to control myself.
          (off her look)
          I have to be alone.
          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The
          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          We could take him to the river.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I don't want him ever found.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          We'll weight him with rocks.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          No. We'll put the rocks inside
          him.
          (off his look)
          Cut him open. I will sew the
          rocks inside him.
          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.

<b>          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next
          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes
          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter
          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder
          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...

<b>                         (CONTINUED)
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          117.
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's
          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.
          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.

<b>          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT
</b>
          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame
          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs
          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.
          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a
          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in
          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove
          off, but Isabelle stops him:

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Wait.
          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his
          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting
          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them
          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.
          Peter gives her a questioning look.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          These belonged to my grandmother.
          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he
          does... something begins to shine through in the
          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          They're silver.

<b>          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.
          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in
          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...
          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the
          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Death was too good for him.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I can live with it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          118.
</b>
<b>          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and
          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last
          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Where will you go?

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I don't know. I need to
          understand what I've become.
          Maybe I can learn to control it.
          (off her look)
          I'll take my own life before I
          take another's.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          I know.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          I'm not coming back. I don't want
          you to wait for me. This is the
          last time you'll ever see me.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          No, it isn't. You'll be in my
          dreams until the day I die.
          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          You know, Henri is a good man.

<b>                         ISABELLE
</b>          Yes, he is.
          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)

<b>          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY
</b>
          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with
          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers
          bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          Life in my village was changed
          forever. There were many
          questions and few answers. In the

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          end, the Wolf did not return. And
          that was answer enough for most.

<b>          EXT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're
          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and
          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          Henri and I were married. He was
          a good man and a good father. I
          loved him very much. But I never
          loved him the same way that I
          loved Peter. That was the one
          secret in our marriage.

<b>          EXT. FIELD - DAY
</b>
          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing
          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.
          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          I only tell you now because he is
          dead. And if he knows now, I
          believe that he forgives me, for
          he must also know that I never
          loved him falsely.

<b>          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,
          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed
          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          This is my story, not that I
          expect you will believe it. In my
          own village, the events of that
          awful winter have already passed
          into legend. Parents tell their
          children to be good or else the
          Wolf will come and gobble them up.
          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          They've already forgotten. A
          simple children's story is all
          that remains.

</b>
<b>          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

<b>          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>          But I often wonder if I hear him.

<b>          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

<b>          FADE OUT.
