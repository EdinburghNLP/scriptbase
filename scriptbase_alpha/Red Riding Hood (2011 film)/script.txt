                         FADE IN:

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Did you hear that?

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          The innkeeper told me --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FAT KNIGHT
          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          What the devil are you --?!

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

                         FRANCE

                         1324

          5.

                         CONTINUED:
          There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is
          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-
          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

                         LUCIE
          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

                         ISABELLE
          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

                         SUZETTE
          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even
          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark
          contrast to her squalid surroundings.
          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

                         CARPENTER
          Hey, there! Let one of these
          young lads get that for you.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          I can do it myself.
          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.

          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY

          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

                         CESAIRE
          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

                         PETER
          I'm taking a break.

                         WOODCUTTER BOSS
          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY

          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,
          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes
          her in his arms, kissing her. She holds him tight.

                         PETER
          I was afraid you weren't coming.

                         ISABELLE
          You should know better than that.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CONTINUED:
          He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
          her eyes, smiles up at him. Touches his face.

                         ISABELLE
          I think my sister's starting to
          suspect something.

                         PETER
          Do you think she'll tell your
          father?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to
          know. Besides, my father likes
          you.

                         PETER
          Of course he does. Right up until
          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

                         ISABELLE
          What's going on?

                         PETER
          You haven't heard?
          (off her look)
          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Was it the Wolf?

                         PETER
          Could it have been anything else?
          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

                         PETER
          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

                         ISABELLE
          I know. You say that every month.

          8.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her. She kisses
          him back, then tries to stop kissing him. It's not easy.

                         ISABELLE
          I'd better go.

                         PETER
          Same time tomorrow?

                         ISABELLE
          Don't get used to this. I start
          my sewing lessons next week.

                         PETER
          You really think you can go all
          day without seeing me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'll manage somehow. Pride is a
          cardinal sin, by the way.

                         PETER
          I can think of worse sins I could
          be committing.
          She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon
          sign. He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon
          with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent.

                         HERALD
          Half full! Half full!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket.
          Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your grandmother,
          understand? You're her student
          now, the same as the other girls.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Mother.
          Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.

                         SUZETTE
          My last baby has grown up.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING

          Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
          hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She
          applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes
          it 'œdisappear,'� then smiles big and runs away.
          A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look.

                         LUCRECE
          You're only encouraging him.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.
          THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced,
          cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical,
          serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious).
          A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look
          tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.

                         ISABELLE
          You look happy.

                         ROXANNE
          Aren't you excited?

                         PRUDENCE
          It's too early to be excited.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm just trying to look on the
          bright side.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Well, stop it before somebody
          hurts you.
          The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

          The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through
          the dark forest. The puppy stops at the edge of the
          forest. Then it WHINES and refuses to follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING

          The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as
          they can see. Rosemaria walks with Roxanne. Prudence
          hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PRUDENCE
          Did you hear about her and the
          Darley brothers?

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, no! Which one?

                         PRUDENCE
          Both! On the same night!
          Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
          contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at
          them. She scowls at Isabelle.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why does your grandmother have to
          live so far away?

                         ISABELLE
          What's the matter, Rosemaria?
          Having trouble walking?
          Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving.
          Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a
          BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage,
          well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it.
          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
          with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, stop dawdling. Come on,
          come on.
          The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your mother has warned you not to
          expect any special treatment from
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, ma'am.
          Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a
          smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, then your mother doesn't
          know me very well, does she?
          Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles, casting
          loops of red wool yarn onto one of them, a BLACK CAT
          resting on her lap. Her bedchamber is hidden by a
          beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates.
          The girls sit facing her, watching as she knits. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There. This is going to be my
          foundation. Everything I do now
          will build off of this.
          She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Roxanne, is this a good
          foundation?

                         ROXANNE
          I don't know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why not?

                         ROXANNE
          Well... you haven't told us what
          you're making.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There's something else I haven't
          told you. I haven't told you why
          I'm making it. Before you begin
          any task, you must first always
          ask yourself why.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why?
          The girls laugh. Grandmother gives her a patient smile.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because understanding why you are
          doing something is the key to
          doing it successfully. So, before
          we begin today, let's be certain
          that we have a good foundation.
          Who can tell me why you are here?

                         CONTINUED:

                         PRUDENCE
          To become seamstresses. To learn
          how to sew and mend clothes.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That's what you are doing. But
          why are you doing it?
          Blank looks. None of them have ever considered this.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Isabelle, your sister studied with
          me last winter. What does she do
          now?

                         ISABELLE
          She works with the women.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why don't you work with them?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know how to yet.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And how does that make you feel?
          Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight.

                         ISABELLE
          Like a child.
          Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be coming here every day
          for the next three months. During
          that time, I will teach you
          everything you need to know to be
          productive members of our
          community. But there is something
          far more important that will also
          be happening here.
          All the girls are paying close attention now, but
          Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be proving your worth and
          learning your place in the world.
          And I promise you, when you leave
          here for the last time, you will
          never feel like a child again.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

          The four girls return to the village along the forest
          path. Waiting for them is Peter. Isabelle pretends to
          not notice him. As they pass, he calls out to her:

                         PETER
          I need to talk to you.
          Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.

                         ISABELLE
          What about?
          Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
          sees that the other girls have stopped to watch.
          Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and
          leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          When were you planning on telling
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Telling you what?

                         PETER
          That you're engaged to be married
          to Henri Smith.
          Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          Henri Smith? Is this a joke?

                         PETER
          Look at me. Just look at me and
          tell me you didn't know.
          She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.

                         ISABELLE
          Who told you this?

                         PETER
          Your father.
          Off Isabelle's look...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is gathered around the table. Isabelle and
          Lucie listen to their parents in stunned silence.

                         SUZETTE
          It's all been arranged. Your
          marriage to Henri will settle our
          debt to his father.
          Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.

                         SUZETTE
          We know that you and Peter have
          become friends. But you have
          adult responsibilities now. That
          means putting your family's
          interests ahead of your own.

                         ISABELLE
          So Henri Smith is in the family's
          interest and Peter is not?

                         CESAIRE
          Peter is a fine young man.

                         ISABELLE
          But what? He's poor? He's an
          orphan?

                         SUZETTE
          He's not one of us. His parents
          were outsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          Why? Because they hadn't lived
          here since Noah built the ark?

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your tongue.
          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.

                         LUCIE
          Do you realize how this makes me
          look? I'm older than her by more
          than a year. If anyone should be
          getting married in the spring,
          it's me.
          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the
          cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled. Suzette sits nearby.

          This was your idea. Now I have
          both of them hating me.
          In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but
          Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop.

                         SUZETTE
          We knew Isabelle was going to be
          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her
          to simply do as she's told. She's
          too much like her grandmother.

                         CESAIRE
          That she is. What about Lucie?

                         SUZETTE
          She's a good girl, but she's still
          a child. Talk to her. You're her
          father. She'll listen to you.
          Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's
          been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle gives her a sad look.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

                         HENRI
          Hello, Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Hello, Henri.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence. Then:

                         HENRI
          So I suppose you've heard.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. My parents are very pleased.

                         HENRI
          And you? Are you pleased?

                         ISABELLE
          It's a very generous arrangement.

          Not the answer he was hoping for. Another awkward beat.

                         HENRI
          Do you have any other feelings
          about it? About me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm not sure. We've never really
          talked that much.

                         HENRI
          I know. That's why I asked you to
          walk with me. I wanted to talk.

                         ISABELLE
          What for?

                         HENRI
          Well... because we're going to be
          husband and wife soon.

                         ISABELLE
          Not until the spring festival.
          That's months away. A lot can
          happen in a few months.
          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          All right. What would you like to
          talk about?

                         HENRI
          I'm not really sure. I brought
          you this.
          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

                         ISABELLE
          Well, I'm glad we had this
          conversation.
          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes
          averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's
          purposefully ignoring her mother. Suzette notices.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SUZETTE
          You know, I had a sweetheart when
          I was your age, too.
          Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself.
          Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction.

                         ISABELLE
          What happened?

                         SUZETTE
          Nothing happened. My parents
          arranged for me to marry your
          father and that was the end of
          that.

                         ISABELLE
          Didn't you want to marry your
          sweetheart?

                         SUZETTE
          Of course, I did. But there's
          more to marriage than being in
          love. Love doesn't always last
          and it certainly doesn't fill your
          children's bellies in the winter.

                         ISABELLE
          You've never wished you could have
          married that other boy?

                         SUZETTE
          Not even once.
          Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles
          on it. Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them.

                         PETER
          We need to talk.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church, out of sight.
          Peter looks off toward the woods, his back to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          You have to go through with it.
          You have to marry Henri.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle takes a step toward him. She hesitates,
          gathering her nerve to speak. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care what my parents want.
          They don't own me. I love you.

                         PETER
          That doesn't matter.

                         ISABELLE
          It does to me. Doesn't it matter
          to you?

                         PETER
          It's not our decision to make.

                         ISABELLE
          You sound like my mother.

                         PETER
          Then maybe you should start
          listening to your mother.
          (off her look)
          It's over. They had to find out
          eventually. Don't turn this into
          something that it's not. We had
          our fun, but that's all it ever
          was.
          Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you.

                         PETER
          Go home, Isabelle. Go home and
          grow up.
          Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you!
          He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream. The sun is just barely
          rising, rays of light shining through the trees. He
          smiles. It looks like the start of a beautiful day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The village is bustling with activity, but there's a
          palpable tension. The picture on the moon sign is of a
          three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to
          a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING

          Isabelle emerges from the cottage. Roxanne, Prudence,
          and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her. They all start
          toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something...
          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.
          Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.
          Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls
          follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING

          The girls walk through the village. Isabelle is lost in
          thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal.

                         ROXANNE
          What's wrong with Lucie?

                         ROSEMARIA
          How would you feel if you were in
          love with your sister's fiancÃ©e?
          Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie is not in love with my
          fiancÃ©e.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Really? So she's just had a crush
          on him since she was ten?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          As if she would really tell you
          something like that.

                         ROSEMARIA
          She didn't. She told my sister.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Did you honestly not know?
          Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just
          then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri
          works with his father, ADRIEN. Henri smiles at Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on. We're going to be late.
          She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's
          cottage. Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy.
          There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A
          SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest, overgrown and
          narrow. Rosemaria looks at it for a beat...
          Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them.
          She looks back and sees her start down the other path.

                         ROXANNE
          Rosemaria...?
          The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed
          to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path.

                         ISABELLE
          What are you doing?

                         ROSEMARIA
          What does it look like?

                         ISABELLE
          You can't go that way. You have
          to stay on the path.

                         ROSEMARIA
          This way is faster.

                         PRUDENCE
          But it's not safe. My brother
          says the bridge is rotten.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ROSEMARIA
          I don't care. It's bad enough
          working all day in that smelly
          cottage. It's not reasonable for
          them to expect us to walk that far
          every day on top of that.
          She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then:

                         PRUDENCE
          If you get lost, nobody will come
          looking for you. Not tonight.
          This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the
          narrow path. It suddenly seems a little ominous.
          Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls
          exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on.
          The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects.
          Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone finish what you're
          working on. Your parents will be
          worried if you're not home before
          it starts to get dark.
          The girls begin packing up their work. Prudence sighs.

                         PRUDENCE
          I wish someone would just kill
          that stupid wolf.

                         ROXANNE
          You can't just kill it. It's not
          an ordinary wolf. It's a devil-
          wolf. A servant of Satan himself.
          Prudence rolls her eyes. Whatever.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Who cares what it is? It's only
          one night a month. You stay
          inside, lock up the animals, and
          you don't go into the forest.
          It's never killed anyone from the
          village and as long as we leave it
          alone, it never will.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          My goodness. I had no idea our
          young people were so woefully
          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the
          Bold even visited here once. But
          that, of course, was before the
          Wolf came.
          The girls listen attentively.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents fear the Wolf because
          they remember when it did kill
          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began
          to spread that we were cursed.
          That was when our village began to
          die. And that was why my husband
          led a group of men into the woods
          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.
          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          After that, people here didn't
          have much stomach to go hunting
          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us
          alone ever since.

                         ISABELLE
          People still die.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Yes, but nobody we know.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone knows what should be
          done. But it's not always easy to
          do what you know is right.
          Sometimes it's easier to settle
          for being safe.
          Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

                         ISABELLE
          You were right. About Peter. I
          was being childish.

                         (BEAT)
          But I'm not going to marry Henri.
          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

                         SUZETTE
          You'll do as you're told. It's
          all been arranged.

                         ISABELLE
          The family gains the same no
          matter which one of us marries
          him. And I don't love Henri.
          Lucie does.
          Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.

                         ISABELLE
          She's right. It's not fair. I
          will gladly trade places with her.
          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

                         LUCIE
          Shut up.
          Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry... I...

                         LUCIE
          Please. Just shut up and mind
          your own business.
          A tense beat. Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT

          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

                         BOY
          I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat
          you up!

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What on earth --?
          The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the
          look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne,
          Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has
          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It's my little secret. A pinch
          will help you rest. A little more
          and you'll sleep through the end
          of the world.
          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

                         ISABELLE
          I think I'd like that.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Two men, the Merchant and the REEVE, gossip by the well.

                         MERCHANT
          She had it coming, if you ask me.
          What the hell was she doing out
          there?
          Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,
          drawing a water from the well. Both men shift
          uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as
          Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body. Suddenly,
          Grandmother stops. She's found something clutched in
          Lucie's hand. A troubled look comes over her...

                         ISABELLE
          What is it?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Nothing.
          Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Lucie's funeral. Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle,
          who holds Grandmother's hand. The other girls are here,
          too. Roxanne sits with her mother, MARGUERITE, and
          Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The
          priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Wherefore each man and woman that
          is wise, make him ready thereto;
          for we all shall die, and we know
          not how soon...

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the
          cemetery. Father Auguste frowns, disapproving.
          Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside.

                         MARGUERITE
          Take your brother home.
          Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
          away, but he fights her, crying and kicking.
          Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien.

                         ADRIEN
          She was a good girl. We all loved
          her.
          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

                         HENRI
          I'm here for you, too.
          But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          ATTEWATER, the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of
          the Villagers. Isabelle, Suzette, and Grandmother sit
          with Cesaire, who is angrily addressing the crowded room.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          A line has been crossed. The
          beast must be destroyed!

                         MERCHANT
          Your daughter crossed the line.
          She went into the woods.

                         CESAIRE
          She was taken. She must have
          been!

                         MERCHANT
          So the Wolf broke into your home
          and stole your daughter without
          waking anyone or leaving any sign
          at all?

                         REEVE
          It's been almost thirty years
          since someone here was killed by
          the Wolf. We've left it alone.
          Why would it suddenly come and
          take one of us now?
          Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I know something.
          Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks.
          She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded
          up washcloth we saw her with earlier.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I found this. I believe it must
          belong to her attacker.
          Attewater unfolds the washcloth. There are a few strands
          of hair inside. He gives her a sharp look.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is not animal hair.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          No, it isn't. It's human.
          A stunned silence comes over the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          No man could have done the things
          that were done to your
          granddaughter. It must have been
          the Wolf.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yet she was holding a man's hair
          in her hand when she died.

                         ATTEWATER
          What are you suggesting?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That the man and the Wolf may be
          one and the same.
          A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd.

                         ATTEWATER
          A werewolf.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          It would explain much. The Pope
          himself has declared that such
          creatures exist.
          The thought gives everyone pause.

                         MERCHANT
          Even if you're right, it doesn't
          help us. The woods are filled
          with hermits and strangers. If
          there's a werewolf among them, how
          will we find it?

                         ATTEWATER
          There are experts in these
          matters. Men who find and try
          witches and werewolves. We could
          request the Church to send
          someone.
          Grandmother gives him a sharp look.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not someone. You're talking about
          Father Solomon.
          This sends a ripple of comment through the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          He is the Church's most successful
          werewolf hunter.

                         ADRIEN
          But what of his methods? The man
          once burned down an entire village
          just to root out one witch.

                         ATTEWATER
          Unsubstantiated rumors. The
          Church has appointed him the
          Witchfinder General of all
          Christendom.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          That is also unsubstantiated.
          Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground.

                         ATTEWATER
          I have the utmost confidence in
          the ability of the Witchfinder
          General to determine the nature of
          the beast and put an end to it. I
          will dispatch a messenger in the
          morning.

                         CESAIRE
          Even if Father Solomon agrees to
          help us, it will take weeks for
          him to get here. That means
          another full moon. Maybe two.
          We must defend ourselves.
          A long, silent beat. Then, Henri stands.

                         HENRI
          He's right. The beast broke the
          peace, not us.

                         (TO CESAIRE)
          I will help you kill it.
          Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after
          another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too.

                         REEVE
          As will I. We all will.
          Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red
          riding hood. She gives it a solemn look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          A light snow has fallen. The girls are walking to
          Grandmother's house, but Isabelle sadly lags behind, lost
          in thought. She's wearing Lucie's red riding hood.

          Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand. Isabelle
          smiles sadly and takes it. Prudence and Rosemaria let
          them catch up, then they continue on together...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns home. Suzette is making dinner, but
          stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucie's red cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          Who gave you permission to wear
          that?

                         ISABELLE
          Nobody. I just --

                         SUZETTE
          Your Grandmother made that for
          Lucie. Take it off.
          Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette
          snatches the cloak away from her. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          It was folded when they found her.
          Her clothes, too. Did you notice
          that?

                         SUZETTE
          Someone must have folded them.
          A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts...

                         ISABELLE
          She was so unhappy.
          Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.

                         SUZETTE
          What are you saying?

                         ISABELLE
          Maybe she went into the woods on
          purpose. Maybe she wanted to die.
          Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie's soul is at peace with God.
          Don't you ever again suggest
          otherwise.
          Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned
          speechless.

          EXT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle
          cottage. If there had been train tracks in the
          fourteenth century, this place would have been on the
          wrong side of them.
          Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
          long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a
          surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears.

                         PETER
          Are you all right?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry. I just need to talk to
          someone. Can I come in?
          Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
          can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's
          standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.

                         ROSEMARIA
          No. You can't.
          She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives
          him a stricken look and runs away. Peter watches her go.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except
          for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria
          gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have
          gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          I hate the cold. Why can't we
          have lessons in the summer?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I suppose that would be easier.
          But then that would defeat the
          purpose. People only change when
          things are difficult.
          Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns
          away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then
          leaves her alone. Isabelle stares into the fire...

          viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne

          Watching what?
          Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom,
          adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees
          Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and
          leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse.
          Roxanne glares at her.

                         MARGUERITE
          It's money, isn't it? You could
          make twice this your first time.
          They pay more for virgins.
          Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          The full moon sign swings in the wind, a few flakes of
          snow whipping through the air around it.

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe. He hands the
          hammer to Henri, fixing him with a serious look.

                         ADRIEN
          Don't do this for Isabelle. She
          can't marry you if you're dead.

                         HENRI

                         (LYING)
          I'm not doing it for her.

                         ADRIEN
          Your mother would be proud to see
          the man you've become.
          Henri is moved. He nods, at a loss for words.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - DUSK

          Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided
          to brew some beer and sell it. Cesaire stands before a
          group of men. They've all had too much to drink.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          My father died trying to kill the
          Wolf. For forty years, we have
          lived in fear of it. But no more.
          And never again. We don't need a
          Witchfinder General to rid of us
          this hell-hated beast. Because by
          God and all that is holy, the
          Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e shall
          die tonight!
          The men CHEER.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets. The
          rest of the Villagers line the streets, watching them go.
          Claude tries to join the hunters, thinking it's a game,
          but Roxanne quickly catches him. Peter shakes his head
          at the dubious spectacle. Henri sees him.

                         HENRI
          You're not coming with us?

                         PETER
          Are you joking? These fools are
          as likely to kill each other as
          they are anything else.
          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle
          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.
          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,
          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When
          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks
          away. Henri gives Peter a gloating look. Peter scowls.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DUSK

          The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline,
          one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village.
          They each have lit torches. CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched
          in the brush. Cesaire walks along the line of men.

                         CESAIRE
          Get that torch out.
          Henri douses his torch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The full moon is high in the night sky. Snow is falling.
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.
          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.
          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,
          staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake. Suddenly... a
          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,
          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the
          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The
          Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          The HOWLING is getting closer. Isabelle goes to the
          window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out... and is
          startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it
          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are
          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him
          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --
          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.

                         REEVE
          Who was that screaming?

                         CARPENTER
          I don't know.

                         MERCHANT
          Look.
          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a
          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.
          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time
          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary
          look, but then start after it.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered
          brush is as high as their waists. They pause and listen.
          Only silence. They carefully make their way in the
          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves
          CRUNCH under their feet...
          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.
          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,
          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.
          He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet.

                         REEVE
          Which way did it go?
          The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve
          plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky
          hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS
          again. The Men look up at the hillside.

                         CARPENTER
          The caves. It's in the caves.

          INT. CAVE - NIGHT

          The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting
          their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The
          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark
          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...
          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they
          approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The
          SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell
          where it's coming from.

                         REEVE
          Split up. Two groups.
          Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow
          the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men
          crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be
          getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening.
          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The
          SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch
          inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave

          37.

                         CONTINUED:
          floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the
          wall to keep from falling...
          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep
          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop
          himself, and then --
          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.
          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.
          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning
          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood
          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.
          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...
          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's
          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood
          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --
          -- just as the wolf attacks.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing
          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.
          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and
          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or
          failure. But as they near...
          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike
          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,
          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle
          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.
          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back
          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and
          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle
          enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I heard your father wounded the
          beast. He was a brave man.

                         HENRI
          Did you hear what it did to him?
          It chewed off his private parts.
          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.

                         HENRI
          And I did nothing. I was too
          scared. I couldn't move. I just
          let my father be eaten alive.
          She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.

                         HENRI
          No. I don't want you here.
          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
          keeps hammering away on the anvil.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses
          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with
          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:

                         LUCRECE
          I thought your mother would be
          here. They used to be quite
          close.
          Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing
          more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden
          realization...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as
          she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes
          her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then:

                         ISABELLE
          You told me you had a sweetheart
          before you were married. It was
          Henri's father, wasn't it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie was in love with Henri. She
          could have married him.
          (off Suzette's look)
          Couldn't she have?

                         SUZETTE
          We arranged for you to marry him.

                         ISABELLE
          But you gained the same no matter
          which one of us married him. So
          why did it have to be me?

                         SUZETTE
          I think you know the answer to
          that question.

                         ISABELLE
          No. You say it.
          Suzette's eyes well up. Then:

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie was Henri's half-sister.
          She was not your father's
          daughter.
          Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:

                         ISABELLE
          Am I? Do you even know?

                         SUZETTE
          Yes. I was already pregnant when
          your father and I married.

                         ISABELLE
          Does he know?

                         SUZETTE
          No. And he must never know.
          Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.

                         SUZETTE
          Isabelle!

                         (BEAT)
          Promise me you won't tell him.
          Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She
          leaves without answering.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to
          Isabelle. Isabelle's eyes are red from crying.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I've found that there's no burden
          that doesn't at least seem a
          little lighter on a full stomach.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know what to do. She
          wants me to pretend like I don't
          know. How am I supposed to go on
          living in that house?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have a right to be angry with
          her. But try not to hate her.
          Too much hate will eat you alive.
          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
          shoulder.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and
          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

                         CESAIRE
          You're a good girl.
          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
          chest, and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children
          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
          Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          I heard there's going to be a
          festival on the night of the next
          full moon. To celebrate.

                         ROXANNE
          A festival? I've never been to
          one!

                         PRUDENCE
          My father says he hasn't seen one
          since he was a boy.

                         ROXANNE
          It's strange, isn't it? You think
          because things have been a certain
          way your whole life that they'll
          always be the same. Then
          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is Villiers la CroisÃ©e?

                         MERCHANT
          Yes, my lord.

                         CAPTAIN
          Summon your bailiff. My master
          would speak with him at once.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

                         MERCHANT
          Of course, my lord. May I ask to
          what does he owe this honor?

                         CAPTAIN
          He requested the services of His
          Eminence, the Witchfinder General.
          You may tell him that he has
          arrived.
          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is indeed an honor, Your
          Eminence.
          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

                         ATTEWATER
          As you can see, our werewolf
          problem has been dealt with.

                         SOLOMON
          That is no werewolf.
          Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle
          and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.

                         SOLOMON
          When a werewolf dies, it returns
          to its human form. If what you
          killed was a werewolf, then you
          would have a human head skewered
          atop that pole.

                         REEVE
          And I suppose you've seen this? A
          wolf turning into a man?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:
          Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
          toward him. The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without
          doubt, the bigger man. The Reeve's eyes flick nervously
          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          My wife's name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She
          was very pretty. And we were very
          happy.
          The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.

                         SOLOMON
          We lived in a village not unlike
          this place. And not unlike this
          place, our village was plagued by
          a werewolf. I went out with some
          men to hunt it. It never even
          occurred to me that we might
          actually find it. But we did.
          He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.

                         SOLOMON
          It attacked me. All I saw were
          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked
          it up and put it in my sack.

                         (BEAT)
          When I returned home in the
          morning, I found my wife with a
          bloody rag tied around her left
          wrist. And when I opened my sack,
          the werewolf's paw was gone. This
          is what I found in its place.
          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.

                         SOLOMON
          Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was
          very pretty. And we were very
          happy. Until the day I killed
          her.
          Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.

                         SOLOMON
          Your werewolf is still alive. And
          I promise you, it will kill again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit
          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain
          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the
          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is
          shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it.

                         SOLOMON
          I have examined the body of your
          blacksmith. There were bruises on
          his neck from where the beast held
          him in its jaws, squeezing his
          throat so that he could not
          scream.

                         CESAIRE
          But he did scream. We all heard
          him.

                         SOLOMON
          Only when it wanted you to. It
          used him as bait to lure you into
          the bit of theater it had
          prepared.

                         HENRI
          Theater? My father is not
          playacting. He is dead.

                         REEVE
          And I killed the beast that did
          it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's what it wants you to think.
          It did kill your blacksmith. But
          the animal that you killed was not
          the werewolf.

                         REEVE
          There was blood dripping from its
          teeth.

                         SOLOMON
          The blood was its own. The
          werewolf most likely wounded it
          earlier in the evening and left it
          in the cave for you to find and
          kill.

                         CESAIRE
          'œMost likely,'� he says. Have you
          ever heard anything more unlikely
          in your lives?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.

                         ATTEWATER
          Your Eminence, if what you say is
          true, that we were somehow fooled
          by this thing, it could not have
          done so without foreknowledge of
          our plan to hunt it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's correct. The werewolf does
          not live in the forest as you have
          rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives
          here in the village. Among you.
          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.

                         CESAIRE
          You come here and tell us that
          this boy's father died for
          nothing. You accuse us and call
          us fools. Well, I believe what I
          can see with my own eyes. That
          wolf is dead. And I know it's
          dead because I was with the brave
          men who killed it.

                         MERCHANT
          And what of the festival?

                         ATTEWATER
          The festival was to celebrate the
          death of the Wolf.

                         MERCHANT
          And we say that it's dead! We've
          spent every full moon for the past
          forty years cowering in our homes.
          We've earned a celebration.

                         REEVE
          And paid for it in blood!
          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Have your festival. I will stay
          on here until then to ensure that
          you have the celebration you all
          so richly deserve.
          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
          Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain.
          Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has
          been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe. Despite the
          cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water
          from a basin held by Father Auguste...

                         SOLOMON
          Gloria Patri, et Filio, et
          Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in
          principio, et nunc, et sempter, et
          in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with
          ribbons. Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand.
          Suzette knits.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to the festival.

                         SUZETTE
          All right then.
          She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon kneels in prayer, lit by flickering candlelight.
          He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The festival is in full swing. A bonfire ROARS. The
          Villagers sing and drink. A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
          out and startles the women and children. The children
          chase him with sticks and he comically runs away.
          Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence.
          Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
          costume, but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him.
          Another BOY steals his cap and teases him. Marguerite is
          too busy carousing to notice. Roxanne frowns.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sorry...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          She hurries to help Claude. Isabelle and Prudence watch.

                         PRUDENCE
          She acts more like a mother to him
          than a sister.

                         ISABELLE
          Someone has to look after him.

                         PRUDENCE
          I know. But who looks after her?
          Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - DUSK

          The Captain of Solomon's guard stands watch. The sounds
          of the FESTIVAL can be heard in the distance...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Men play MUSIC and couples dance. Roxanne dances with
          Claude, Prudence with an OLDER BOY... but Isabelle sits
          alone, watching Peter dance with Rosemaria.
          Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer,
          clearly the latest of many. He follows her look and sees
          that she's watching Peter. Henri glares at him...
          ... then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
          him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around. Peter
          is surprised, but ready to laugh it off.

                         PETER
          Take it easy, friend.

                         HENRI
          You didn't come with us. The
          night my father died.
          Peter's smile fades. Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away.

                         HENRI
          You stayed here and let real men
          do the work you didn't have the
          belly for.

                         ISABELLE
          Please, don't do this --
          Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles.
          Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist. Henri

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          overreacts and punches Peter in the eye. Peter falls on
          his ass, but the Villagers just laugh.
          Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down. He could easily
          lay Henri out... but decides against it. He leaves.
          Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her.
          Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries
          off after Peter. Henri watches her go, ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Peter storms off. Isabelle runs after him.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter! Wait!

                         PETER
          Why? So you can hit me, too?

                         ISABELLE
          I just want to make sure you're
          all right.
          Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.

                         PETER
          Why can't you just leave me alone?

                         ISABELLE
          You're bleeding.

                         PETER
          So what? What's the matter with
          you? What do I have to do to make
          you stop caring about me?
          Isabelle is taken aback. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          You think I want to feel like
          this? You think I enjoy feeling
          like a fool every day because I
          can't stop loving you?
          Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what
          her words do to him. She looks up at him, realizing...

                         ISABELLE
          Why are you with Rosemaria? You
          hate Rosemaria.

                         PETER
          I don't have to like her to get
          what I want from her.

          You're a terrible liar.
          Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
          hand against his chest. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          There. You're heart is starting
          to beat faster. And the little
          black circles in the middle of
          your eyes still get bigger when I
          touch you.
          She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes,
          but can't stop himself.

                         ISABELLE
          You can tell me you don't love me,
          but I know what you're really
          feeling. I can feel it with my
          hand and see it with my eyes.
          Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.

                         PETER
          I thought being with Rosemaria
          would be the one thing you would
          never be able to forgive. I
          wanted you to hate me.
          (off her look)
          Isabelle, you are the best thing
          that could ever happen to me. And
          I am the worst thing that could
          ever happen to you.

                         ISABELLE
          How could you think that?

                         PETER
          I wasn't born here. You and I
          both know what that means. I will
          always be a stranger to these
          people. Your parents will never
          let us be together.

                         ISABELLE
          That means less to me now than
          ever. We can leave here. We can
          go someplace where we'll both be
          strangers.

                         PETER
          I can't let you do that. You have
          something here that I will never
          have. You have a place. You have

          a family. With Henri you have a
          future. I'm not going to let you
          ruin that over me.

                         ISABELLE
          The only life I want is with you.

                         PETER
          Isabelle... I'm wrong for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I know you are. I just don't
          care.
          She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as
          if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he
          takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard.

          INT. BARN - DUSK

          A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing.
          He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body.
          He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall. She
          looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to
          her, kissing him hard. She grabs his hand and guides it
          to her breast. Now Peter looks surprised. He hesitates.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want to wait.

                         PETER
          But not like this.

                         (A BEAT)
          I want to marry you.
          She searches his face and sees that he's serious.

                         PETER
          I can pack the cart tonight and we
          can leave in the morning.
          (off her look)
          Is that too soon?

                         ISABELLE
          It's not soon enough.
          She pulls him to her and kisses him.

          EXT. BARN - DUSK

          Peter looks outside. The coast is clear. He and
          Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them.

          You'd better get back before
          someone misses you.
          She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from
          him, he sees that she's crying.

                         PETER
          What's wrong?

                         ISABELLE
          This feels like a dream. I'm
          afraid if I leave you I might wake
          up.
          He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them
          notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns to the festival. She sits next to
          Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair.
          Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set.
          The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up
          at it, transfixed. Roxanne looks over at her, curious.

                         ISABELLE
          I've never seen it full before...
          Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone
          falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then,
          somewhere in the dark...
          ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams.
          People start to panic. Claude is knocked down.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!
          Then something massive pushes its way through the surging
          crowd, bursting from the darkness...
          It's THE WOLF. The Villagers gape in horror. It makes
          the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But
          there's something about its face that isn't canine at
          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.
          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,
          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it
          surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them.

          52.

                         CONTINUED:
          A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on
          his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden
          eagle. He tugs the reins and his horse rears back.

                         SOLOMON
          Get to the church, you fools!
          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:

                         SOLOMON

          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S

          HOLY LOVE!
          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.
          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

                         ROXANNE
          Where's Claude? Where is he?!

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

                         ROXANNE
          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

                         SOLDIER #1
          Help... Help me...
          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT

          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

          ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

                         ISABELLE
          You have to stop it. He can't
          hear you and you are going to get
          us killed. Do you understand me?
          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

          EXT. VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT

          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on!
          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

                         THE WOLF
          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

                         THE WOLF
          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being
          impolite, Isabelle?

                         ISABELLE
          How do you know me? Who are you?

                         ROXANNE
          Isabelle...?
          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

                         THE WOLF
          The better to see you with, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you going to kill us?

                         THE WOLF
          Kill you? Why would I kill you?

                         ISABELLE
          Then what do you want?

                         THE WOLF
          I want you, Isabelle.
          Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.

                         THE WOLF
          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

                         THE WOLF
          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

                         THE WOLF
          Leave with me tonight. Run with
          me. The only shackles binding you
          are of your own making. Slip them
          and I can show you the world and
          every pleasure in it.
          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know who you are, but we
          are not the same. I would rather
          die than go with you.

          What about your fat friend here?
          Do you think she would rather die?
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Come away with me. Or I will kill
          her. And I will keep killing
          until you agree to leave with me.
          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.

                         THE WOLF
          Choose now. Quickly.
          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.

                         THE WOLF
          Your silence has doomed them all.
          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:

                         THE WOLF
          Come the next full moon, their
          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne
          inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon.

                         SOLOMON
          We are safe here. God protects
          his own house and those within it.
          Isabelle finds Prudence.

                         ISABELLE
          Is Peter here?

                         PRUDENCE
          Peter? I don't think so.

                         ISABELLE
          What about Claude? Or my parents?

                         PRUDENCE
          I haven't seen any of them.

          58.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Would you look for them? Please?
          Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a
          corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.

                         ROXANNE
          You talked to it.

                         ISABELLE
          It talked to us.
          A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.

                         ROXANNE
          No. It only growled.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          You heard it talk to you?
          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to
          see if anyone has overheard. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Do not speak of this to anyone.
          Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns
          away, afraid and confused.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN

          Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers
          out. A blanket of new snow covers the village. It's as
          if the massacre of the night before never happened.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A
          chair has been overturned. The room is empty.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother! Father!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and
          Cesaire leaning over her, crying. Isabelle stops short.

                         ISABELLE
          Is she dead?

                         CESAIRE
          No, thank God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been
          horribly slashed from scalp to chin. Isabelle recoils.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers slowly gather. Dead bodies litter the
          snow. Roxanne clutches Prudence's arm. Henri joins
          them. Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier #1.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          This man is alive!

                         (TO HENRI)
          Bring me water! Hurry!
          Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
          Solomon's iron grip on his arm. Solomon and his Captain
          go to Soldier #1. Solomon kneels at his side.

                         SOLOMON
          Are you bitten?
          Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his
          eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Step back.
          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
          into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.

                         SOLOMON
          The werewolf's bite is the same as
          death to a man.
          Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          The dark days have returned to
          your village. Your homes are no
          longer safe. The Wolf will
          return. Again and again. And it
          will not stop until it has sucked
          the marrow from all your bones.
          Unless you stop it.

                         (BEAT)
          But to kill a monster, you must
          become one yourself. A wolf
          caught in a trap will chew off its
          own leg to save itself. Will you
          do the same? What sacrifice will
          you make to save your families and
          your way of life? Will you do
          whatever it takes? Or will you

          60.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          cower in your beds and die like
          sheep?
          A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
          cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.

                         SOLOMON
          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to
          believe.
          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

                         ATTEWATER
          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

                         PETER
          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

                         PETER
          I thought you didn't want to wait.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't have any choice. It's not
          just my mother. Something else
          happened last night.
          (off his look)

          61.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell you about it. I just
          have to stay.
          Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I meant everything I said. This
          isn't what I wanted.

                         PETER
          Of course not. You'd better go
          home and see to your mother.
          She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
          the door, but he doesn't look at her. She leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
          Attewater and Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Silver. This is our most potent
          weapon. One blow will kill it.

                         (BEAT)
          That sword has tasted the blood of
          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

                         ATTEWATER
          If it's that powerful, how can we
          possibly hope to stop it?

                         SOLOMON
          We must find it in its human form.
          Who among you do you suspect?
          Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
          Neither of them wants to speak up first.

                         SOLOMON
          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but
          we must start somewhere.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          What about the hair Madame
          Ordeville found on Lucie's body?
          It was dark. The person we are
          looking for must have dark hair.

          62.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Perhaps. Unless it planted the
          hair to make us think that.

                         ATTEWATER
          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

                         SOLOMON
          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          The curse is hereditary?

                         SOLOMON
          It is. But it effects men and
          women differently. A man can
          inherit the curse. Or he can be
          turned simply by being bitten.
          Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.

                         SOLOMON
          But women are immune to the
          werewolf's bite. In order for a
          woman to be turned, she must
          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

                         ATTEWATER
          But it could be a woman.

                         SOLOMON
          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

          The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne
          at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat.

          Has Claude come home?

                         ROXANNE
          No. Nobody has seen him.

                         ISABELLE
          He's run away before. He'll be
          all right.
          Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They
          all exchange a sad look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Well. I suppose this is all of
          us.
          The three of them turn and start toward the woods...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It talked to you. And you
          understood it?

                         ISABELLE
          As clearly as I do you now.
          Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Word of this cannot be allowed to
          spread. Do you understand me?

                         ISABELLE
          Roxanne will never speak of it.
          She won't even talk to me about
          it.
          A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I have to do what it wants.
          (off her look)
          I have communed with an unholy
          beast. What does that make me if
          not cursed?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I don't know. But I won't allow
          you to go with this devil and live
          as its concubine.

                         ISABELLE
          But if it comes back for me and I
          don't go with it, then it will
          kill again. If I have the power
          to save even one life, aren't I
          compelled to do so?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          This is why it chose you. You're
          a good girl with a gentle heart.
          It's using that against you.

                         ISABELLE
          But how could it? Unless it
          really does know me?
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is
          waiting for her. A beat. Then:

                         HENRI
          I spoke with your father. I broke
          off our engagement.
          (off her look)
          I saw you with Peter. Don't
          worry, I didn't tell anyone.
          Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously.

                         ISABELLE
          What about my family's debt?

                         HENRI
          I have no interest in ruining your
          family. I will have you out of
          love or not at all.
          Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought. Suddenly, there's
          a KNOCK at the door. Isabelle opens it. It's Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          They've caught the werewolf!

          Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village.
          There are SHOUTING VOICES up ahead.

                         PRUDENCE
          He's been hiding in a hayloft.
          They caught him trying to steal
          food.

                         ISABELLE
          But who is it?
          An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
          that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob.
          Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way
          through the crowd.

                         ISABELLE
          What's wrong? What's happening?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd.
          Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her.

                         CESAIRE
          Isabelle! Get away from there!
          She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as
          two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!!

                         ISABELLE
          It's not him! It can't be!

                         LUCRECE
          If he's not the werewolf, then why
          was he hiding? What's he afraid
          of?
          The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
          them. Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her.
          She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

          Villagers are gathering. The whole town must be here.
          As Attewater approaches the entrance:

          GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
          Salus populi suprema est lex.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She
          nods to the inscription above the entrance. 'œSALUS

          POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX.'�

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The good of the people is the
          chief law.

                         ATTEWATER
          You read Latin.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And write. I was studying to be a
          nun when I met my husband.

                         ATTEWATER
          He must have been some man.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He was a priest.
          She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You know the boy is innocent.
          He's being tried because he's
          different. Because Father Solomon
          knows he can turn us against him.

                         ATTEWATER
          Father Solomon is here to protect
          us.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          A wolf hunting sheep picks off the
          weakest ones first.
          (off his look)
          This is just the beginning.
          She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The room is crammed with Villagers. Isabelle sits with
          Cesaire and Grandmother. Attewater sits behind the
          table. Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers. He
          looks afraid, confused. Solomon questions Lucrece. A
          SCRIBE records the proceedings.

                         SOLOMON
          You say you saw the accused
          perform magic?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

                         LUCRECE
          In broad daylight with my own
          eyes. Everyone here has seen it.

                         SOLOMON
          So it was common knowledge that
          the accused was a conjurer?

                         LUCRECE
          Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for
          the Devil's work, but they laughed
          at me and paid him money.
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look.
          Through a SERIES OF CUTS, more witnesses are questioned:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him...

                         SOLOMON
          Are you aware that it is the
          custom of witches and devil
          worshippers to hold their black
          sabbaths in cemeteries?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Yes, Your Eminence.

                         SOLOMON
          And do you know of their practice
          of dancing with invisible devils
          during these rituals?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I have heard it said so, yes.

                         SOLOMON
          Is there one here today who you
          have seen dancing in your
          cemetery?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          (hesitant; a beat)
          Yes. But I don't believe he meant
          anything by it. It was in jest.

                         SOLOMON
          So you consider the black mass to
          be a jest?
          There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers.
          Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          No, of course not.

                         SOLOMON
          Then point him out.
          Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.

                         MARGUERITE
          Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude.

                         SOLOMON
          What is your relationship to the
          accused?

                         MARGUERITE
          I am his mother.

                         SOLOMON
          And where is his father?

                         MARGUERITE
          I don't know, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, what is his name?
          She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.

                         MARGUERITE
          I never learned his name, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          You say a man whose name you
          cannot recall is the father of
          your child? What can you tell us
          about him?

                         MARGUERITE
          Not much, sir.
          She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her.

                         SOLOMON
          Almost as if it were a dream?
          (off her look)
          Certain devils called incubi can
          collect human semen and then
          transfer it to women as they
          sleep. A woman who unwittingly
          conceives in this manner would not
          be a whore. She would be
          blameless in the eyes of God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         CONTINUED:
          Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful...

                         SOLOMON
          You remember almost nothing of the
          man who impregnated you. Is it
          not possible that there was no
          man? That the accused is not the
          product of your own sin, but the
          foul offspring of a werewolf whose
          semen was placed in you by an
          incubus while you slept?

                         MARGUERITE
          Yes! Yes, I remember now! He
          came to me in my sleep! It wasn't
          my fault! God save me, it wasn't
          my fault!
          Roxanne buries her face in her hands.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER)

          Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          We have proven here today that
          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the
          accused has refused to confess,
          this court calls upon its final
          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.
          Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

          Isabelle stands before Solomon. Claude waves. She
          ignores him.

                         SOLOMON
          On the night of the last full
          moon, you were attacked by the
          Wolf. You looked it in the eye.
          And the one thing a werewolf can
          never change is its eyes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CONTINUED:
          He gestures to the Soldiers. They grab Claude and force
          him to look at her.

                         SOLOMON
          Look into his eyes, my child. Do
          you see the beast in them?
          Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
          expectant. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          It isn't him. It can't be. He
          was with us when the Wolf
          attacked.
          Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.

                         SOLOMON
          Is this true? Is there another
          here who can speak to this?

                         ROXANNE
          I can! It's true! I saw him!

                         LUCRECE
          She's his sister! She'll say
          anything!
          The suspicious Villagers agree. Roxanne gives Isabelle a
          desperate look. Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter.

                         ISABELLE
          He was there! He carried Claude
          away! He saved his life!
          Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
          back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.

                         CARPENTER
          She is mistaken. I did no such
          thing.
          Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
          but no one will speak up. Solomon frowns.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Since no one here can
          bear witness, we must extort a
          confession. This court shall
          reconvene tomorrow at dawn.
          Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
          Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table. Cesaire is in
          the other room feeding Suzette.

                         ISABELLE
          Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen
          to me? Doesn't he care that
          Claude isn't guilty?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He'd rather let an innocent boy
          die than risk letting the Wolf go
          free.

                         ISABELLE
          But the Wolf is free. And the
          moon will be full in two days.
          The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
          close, lowers her voice.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          We both know it will be coming for
          you. You must leave here tomorrow
          and never return.
          A long beat. Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          I cannot leave.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have no choice. The
          alternative is unthinkable.

                         ISABELLE
          What is unthinkable is that I
          should be responsible for the
          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf's sins are on its own
          twice-damned soul, not yours.

                         ISABELLE
          But what if it was you it wanted?
          Would you go with it to save me?
          Or would you leave me to die?
          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
          night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother and Isabelle step outside, followed by
          Cesaire. The SCREAMING can be heard more clearly.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon. Extorting his
          confession.
          Claude's screams sending chills down their spines.

                         CESAIRE
          You should have condemned him
          today. At least it would have
          been quick.
          Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
          Grandmother continue to listen.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears,
          trying to block out the SCREAMING. Her mother sits by
          the fire as if nothing unusual is going on.

                         ROXANNE
          How can you just sit there and
          listen to this?
          Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
          grabs Marguerite's coin purse.

                         MARGUERITE
          Where are you going with that?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't you touch me again. Ever.
          Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - NIGHT

          A fire burns underneath a 'œBrazen Bull,'� a hollow, life-
          size bull made of brass. The fire heats the metal to
          almost red-hot. Claude's screams come from inside it.
          Solomon glowers, frustrated. Attewater looks sick.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Enough of this. Let's eat.
          He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a
          document.

                         ATTEWATER
          What is this?

                         SOLOMON
          A statement declaring that you
          heard the boy confess. All it
          requires is your signature. Or
          your mark, if you cannot write.

                         ATTEWATER
          But he has not confessed. How
          could he have?
          Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Listen more carefully
          this time.
          He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
          fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All
          he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull.
          The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.

                         SOLOMON
          Listen to how he sings of his love
          of Satan. How he despairs that he
          will never again copulate with the
          dead or sink his teeth into the
          flesh of pregnant women and eat
          their unborn children.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly
          realizing. Father Solomon is insane.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop this.

                         SOLOMON
          No. You stop it.
          (off his look)
          We both know he is guilty. But I
          cannot legally execute him without
          a witness or a confession. Sign
          this and we have a confession.
          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the
          document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the
          bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags
          him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude.
          Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f.g. His
          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.

                         SOLOMON
          This is the business of werewolf
          hunting and you had best develop a
          stomach for it. Because where
          there is one werewolf, there are
          two. And where there are two,
          there are more.

                         (BEAT)
          This is only the beginning.
          Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater
          trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon is eating dinner. The Captain enters.

                         CAPTAIN
          A girl to see you.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, I've yet to come across a
          girl I wouldn't at least look at.
          The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps
          forward. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          I assume you came here with a
          purpose.
          She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in
          front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins.

                         ROXANNE
          I would like to bargain for the
          release of my brother.

                         SOLOMON
          Your brother has just confessed.

                         ROXANNE
          What? That's not possible!

                         SOLOMON
          It has been witnessed and
          notarized. He will hang in the
          morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she
          is about to say. Realizing that she has no choice.

                         ROXANNE
          I have more than money to offer
          you.
          She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
          bodice, but Solomon interrupts.

                         SOLOMON
          What do you think you are doing?
          (off her look)
          Do you have any idea who I am? I
          am the Witchfinder General. I
          have fought in the Holy Land. I
          have waded hip deep in blood and
          resisted all the temptations of
          the infidels. And you seek to
          stay the hand of justice with such
          a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl,
          before I have you whipped.
          Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
          her away. Roxanne struggles against them.

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have something else! I
          know the name of a witch!
          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She
          cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life...

                         ROXANNE
          Spare my brother and I will tell
          you her name.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their
          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.
          Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind
          her. She huddles against the wall, shivering.

          76.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She
          looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...
          It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body
          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle
          chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly
          takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The chamber is full again. Cesaire, Grandmother,
          Prudence, and Henri are here. Peter sits in the last
          row. Isabelle is in the seat of the accused. Roxanne
          stands witness. She's trying not to look at Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          How are you acquainted with the
          accused?

                         ROXANNE
          We were friends.

                         SOLOMON
          And how long did this friendship
          last?

                         ROXANNE
          All my life.

                         SOLOMON
          And in this time, have you ever
          known the accused to converse with
          devils?

                         ROXANNE
          Yes, Your Eminence. On the night
          of the last full moon, she talked
          to the werewolf. And later she
          told me that it also talked to
          her.
          Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
          clenches his fist. Solomon turns to Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          What of this? Do you deny having
          conversed with a werewolf?
          She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          No. I do not deny it.
          The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.

          77.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Describe this encounter.

                         ISABELLE
          It spoke, just as a man speaks.

                         SOLOMON
          And what was the nature of your
          conversation with it?
          Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.

                         ISABELLE
          It told me... It promised to
          leave here and never return. But
          only if I leave with it.
          Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
          over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:

                         REEVE
          But who is it? Make her tell us
          who the werewolf is!

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know! I swear I don't
          know!

                         MERCHANT
          It doesn't matter who it is
          anymore. It wants her, not us.
          Let's just give it what it wants.
          A long, tense beat. Heavy silence. Nobody speaks.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          We should not allow ourselves to
          even consider this.

                         REEVE
          I think we already are.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What's the matter with you? You
          know her. You all know her.

                         REEVE
          Do we? Did we know she could talk
          to werewolves?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She could have run away. She
          could saved herself, but she
          stayed here because she cares more
          about you than she does herself.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Peter reacts. He and Isabelle exchange a look. Now he
          understands...

                         MERCHANT
          If she stayed, she did so because
          she is in league with it. Let
          this be her punishment.
          The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
          gives Attewater a dark look. Then:

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in
          light of your willing confession,
          it is the decision of this court
          that on the night of the next full
          moon, you be left to the mercy of
          the werewolf.
          Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.

                         HENRI
          No!
          Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads. Isabelle is led
          away. Roxanne can only watch, helpless and ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well.
          Prudence pauses to hear what she's saying...

                         LUCRECE
          The first victim was her sister.
          The second was her fiancÃ©e's
          father. Then Rosemaria, who
          everyone knows she hated. And
          don't forget her mother, with half
          her face missing. All this death
          around one girl...
          Prudence has heard enough. She turns away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Roxanne approaches. The Captain eyes her, questioning.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm here for my brother.
          He gestures. Roxanne turns... and sees Claude's body
          dangling from a makeshift gallows. He's been hanged.

          79.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne falls to her knees. The rope around Claude's
          neck CREAKS as his body sways in the wind.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on
          the other side. They speak in furtive whispers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I'm not going to let these
          worthless shits sacrifice you to
          save themselves. We have to find
          the real werewolf before tomorrow
          night.

                         ISABELLE
          That's impossible. Even Father
          Solomon doesn't have the first
          clue.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon doesn't know the
          things that I know.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          I am the oldest person in this
          village who was here when the Wolf
          first came. I remember the old
          days. And what is happening now
          is much worse.

                         ISABELLE
          What was it like in the old days?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf never used to attack in
          the open like it did at the
          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

                         ISABELLE
          It's grown bold.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Or perhaps it made a mistake.

                         (BEAT)
          You're at the center of this. At
          least two of the victims can be
          tied to you. What if it had to
          kill so many at the festival to
          hide the fact that the first two
          killings weren't random?

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes...

                         ISABELLE
          But who would want to kill Lucie?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents said that the Wolf
          broke into the house and took
          Lucie. We both know that's not
          true. What really happened?
          Isabelle hesitates, reluctant.

                         ISABELLE
          My mother made me swear I would
          never speak of it.

                         (BEAT)
          Lucie went to the Wolf willingly.
          Grandmother reacts, horrified.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why would you think such a thing?

                         ISABELLE
          She was in love with Henri.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She took her own life over a boy?

                         ISABELLE
          What other explanation is there?
          Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Hello, Henri.

          INT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother
          stands by the door, watching him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You spoke up very loudly in
          Isabelle's defense today. That
          was very brave.

          I just said what I felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You're under no obligation to
          stand in her defense. You broke
          off your engagement to her.

                         HENRI
          I never stopped caring about her.
          I would do anything for Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          As her sister would have done
          anything for you.
          (off his look)
          Lucie was in love with you. But
          you knew that, didn't you?

                         HENRI
          I had no control over the way she
          felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She kept it secret from almost
          everyone. Even Isabelle didn't
          know. Did you tell anyone?

                         HENRI
          Never.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not even your father?

                         HENRI
          I didn't have to tell him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          So he knew your secrets, did he?
          Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily
          nailing a shoe to the horse's foot. BANG! BANG! BANG!

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You were the only one who could
          have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's
          night. And none of the men who
          went hunting for the Wolf remember
          seeing you after the sun set on
          the night your father died.
          Henri faces her, clutching the hammer...

                         HENRI
          Why are you doing this?

          82.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because I want you to confess.
          You killed Lucie. And your
          father. And God only knows how
          many others. And if you won't
          admit it, then I will tell Father
          Solomon and we will lock you up
          until the moon rises tomorrow
          night and you can no longer hide
          your guilt.
          As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization
          comes over him. Realization and horror.

                         HENRI
          It's you.
          Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps
          back and finds herself bumping against the closed door.

                         HENRI
          My God, it's you. You're the
          Wolf. I can smell it on you now.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Smell what? What are you talking
          about?

                         HENRI
          The night my father died. I saw
          the Wolf pass by, dragging him by
          the neck. I was so terrified I
          couldn't move or make a sound. I
          remember every detail of that
          moment. The way the moonlight
          gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The
          soundless way it moved. I even
          remember the way it smelled. A
          thick, greasy, musky stink.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can smell it on you right
          now.
          A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You accuse me and I'll bring you
          down with me. All they can do is
          take my life. You have more to
          lose.

                         HENRI
          But who do you think they'll
          believe? I'm the blacksmith.

                         HENRI (CONT'D)
          They know me. You're the crazy
          old woman who lives in the woods.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Then I'll have to prove it.

                         HENRI
          Unless you can, you'd best keep
          your mouth shut.
          Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
          door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside --

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          -- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She
          startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look.

                         CESAIRE
          Are you ready for me to take you
          home?
          She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
          holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly
          hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The
          moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence
          with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Stop the cart.
          Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Prudence, come with me. I have
          some blankets I want you to mend
          for Father Auguste.
          Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cart stops out front. Grandmother turns to Prudence.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You take these blankets to Father
          Auguste the moment you're
          finished. Understand?

          All right.
          Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.
          He has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Will you want a ride into town
          tomorrow? To say goodbye to her?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yes. First thing in the morning.
          He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind
          him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She
          puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody
          speaks. The Herald hangs the full moon sign.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook. A flock of
          CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Show yourself! Coward!
          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

                         THE FIGURE
          Go away.
          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Are you all right?

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm sick. You can't come in.

                         PRUDENCE
          You sound awful. Would you like
          us to make you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No. You mustn't come in. Go
          home, now. I want to sleep.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about
          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

                         ROXANNE
          Are you sure you don't want us to
          bring you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No, my dear. Come back tomorrow.
          The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't
          see the blood pour outside under the door behind her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY

          Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw. She's
          startled awake by the sound of her CELL DOOR opening.
          It's Father Auguste.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I've come to hear your final
          confession.
          Isabelle nods shakily and sits up. He enters.

                         ISABELLE
          Has there been any word from my
          grandmother?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          None that I have heard. Why?

          of beer in his hand. Attewater goes to Cesaire.

                         ATTEWATER
          Where is your mother?

                         CESAIRE

                         CONTINUED:
          Attewater reacts, concerned. Cesaire takes another
          drink. Attewater angrily knocks it out of his hand.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop pouring that swill down your
          gullet listen to me!
          Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a
          dangerous look, but Attewater doesn't shy from it.

                         ATTEWATER
          She was trying to find the
          werewolf. If she figured out who
          it is, I need to know now.
          Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,
          flanked by Soldiers. They drag Cesaire to his feet.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait! What has he done?

                         CAPTAIN
          It's just a precaution. Father
          Solomon doesn't want the girl's
          family interfering.
          Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits
          the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.
          Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground.
          The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out.

          What have you done to him?!
          Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding
          iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The
          Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...

          CESAIRE (O.S.)
          Isabelle...
          He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,
          runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars.

          Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach. The
          Captain approaches with a 'œhumiliation mask'�: an iron
          mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny
          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a
          wolf's head. Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it...
          ... then the Captain puts it over her head. Inside the
          mask: almost total darkness. The Captain locks it on.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush.
          Isabelle trudges along behind it. The Villagers line the
          road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the
          streets in her horrific iron wolf mask. Lucrece sneers.

                         LUCRECE
          Not so pretty now, is she?
          The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently
          fuming. Prudence stands next to him. She looks around.

                         PRUDENCE
          Where's Peter?

                         HENRI
          I haven't seen him.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the
          stocks. As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches,
          Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on.

                         SOLOMON
          We, Bailiff Attewater, Father
          Auguste, and Father Solomon of
          Avignon, having in mind that you,

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          Flour, by your own confession,
          have committed acts of vulgar
          heresy, convict you of the sins of
          witches and condemn you to the
          mercy of werewolf. This is the
          sentence given.
          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father
          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.

                         ISABELLE
          Help...
          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.

                         ISABELLE
          Help me... Please... Help me...
          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.

                         ISABELLE

          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T

          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!
          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies
          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)

          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,
          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,
          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.

                         PRUDENCE
          Isabelle? Can you hear me?

                         ISABELLE
          I can hear you.

                         PRUDENCE
          Roxanne wanted you to know how
          sorry she is. She only said those
          things to save her brother.

                         ISABELLE
          I know. Will you tell her that I
          forgive her?

                         PRUDENCE
          Of course.

                         (BEAT)
          I wanted to say... I don't know
          what to say.

                         ISABELLE
          You don't have to say anything.

                         PRUDENCE
          I want to.

                         (BEAT)
          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

                         ISABELLE
          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

                         PRUDENCE
          Yes. It won't be long now.

          ACROSS THE SQUARE
          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

                         SOLOMON
          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

                         SOLOMON
          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

                         SOLOMON
          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

                         ISABELLE
          Get away from me!

                         HENRI
          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

                         HENRI
          I'm trying to get you out of this.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

                         CAPTAIN
          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

          93.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Patience. It's close now...
          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

                         HENRI
          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

                         SOLOMON
          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

                         ATTEWATER

          RUN!
          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village.

                         HENRI
          We have to get to the stable.
          Peter left his cart for us.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter? Where is he --?

                         HENRI
          It doesn't matter. Come on!

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

                         CAPTAIN
          The witch has escaped! The witch
          has escaped!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

                         HENRI
          It's gone.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

                         REEVE
          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE WOLF
          You can't outrun me, my dear. And
          there is no place you can hide
          that I cannot smell you out.

                         (BEAT)
          So what is your decision? Will
          you take your place with me?

                         ISABELLE
          My place will never be with you.

                         THE WOLF
          Where do you belong then? Here?
          With the cowards who so gladly
          sacrificed you to save themselves?

                         ISABELLE
          They're still good people.

                         THE WOLF
          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

                         HENRI
          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

          (off Isabelle's look)
          Your grandmother is the Wolf.
          Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          The Wolf is a man. It told me.

                         HENRI
          You believe it?
          Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out.
          The Soldiers are closing in on them...

                         HENRI
          They're coming.

                         ISABELLE

          She takes his hand and leads him away.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle knocks at the door. Roxanne answers. She gives
          Isabelle a stunned look.

          We need to come inside. Quickly.

          Isabelle and Henri enter. Roxanne shuts the door.
          Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle.

                         MARGUERITE
          Have you lost your mind? If they
          find her here, they'll kill us,
          too!

                         ROXANNE
          Then shut up so they don't find
          her.

                         HENRI
          We have to get out of town.

                         ROXANNE
          You'll never make it. You can
          hide here until morning.

                         ROXANNE
          You might make it to the church.
          Even the king cannot violate the
          protection of sanctuary.

                         HENRI
          And the Wolf cannot cross onto
          holy ground.
          The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan.

                         ISABELLE
          Can we go out your back window?
          Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have an idea.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          A group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve
          hears something coming from behind the cottage...

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Come on!
          The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
          look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window.

                         REEVE
          They're here! Over here!
          The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.

          EXT. VILLAGE - FIELD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the
          Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them.
          Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's
          Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes.

                         HENRI
          Can you keep going?

                         ROXANNE
          I can if you can.
          They run off, chased by the Villagers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

                         SOLOMON
          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

                         SOLOMON
          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

                         THE WOLF
          There is your mighty werewolf
          hunter. Who will save you now?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

                         HENRI
          You bastard! You killed my
          father!

                         ISABELLE
          Henri, what are you doing?

                         HENRI
          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

                         HENRI
          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

                         HENRI
          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

                         ISABELLE
          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

                         MERCHANT
          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

                         THE WOLF
          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

                         HENRI
          Are you all right?
          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

          SOLOMON (O.S.)
          This isn't over.
          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

                         SOLOMON
          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's
          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.
          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.

                         ISABELLE
          It's past noon.

                         SUZETTE
          I know. I didn't want to wake
          you.
          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Where's Father?

                         SUZETTE
          He'll be home soon. They have no
          reason to hold him any longer.

                         ISABELLE
          Did they catch the Wolf?

                         SUZETTE
          No. They lost it in the forest.
          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          What about Grandmother?
          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.

                         SUZETTE
          Roxanne came by. She said your
          grandmother has fallen ill. I was
          hoping you could look in on her.
          Off Isabelle's troubled look...

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red
          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower
          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping
          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.
          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops
          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the
          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.
          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

                         PETER
          Thank God you're all right.
          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help
          me.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PETER
          What did he tell you?
          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.

                         ISABELLE
          Those people back there. I know
          they mean well, but they're just
          people. I didn't expect anything
          from them. I expected something
          from you.

                         PETER
          I just need to talk to you.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to see my Grandmother.
          She's sick. Please don't follow
          me.
          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,
          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She
          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...
          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks
          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...
          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.

          EXT. GULLY - DAY

          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten
          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks
          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges
          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,
          holding onto the rope with both hands...
          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At
          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken
          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to
          catch her breath before continuing...

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the
          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She
          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...

                         ISABELLE
          Grandmother? Are you awake?
          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:

          THE FIGURE (O.S.)
          Pull the bobbin. The latch will
          open.
          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK

          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.

                         REEVE
          You're certain nobody has seen him
          since last night?

                         GUARD
          The Wolf must have taken him.
          What else could have done that?
          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the
          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It
          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.
          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond
          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is
          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.
          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.

                         THE FIGURE
          I've been expecting you.
          Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...

                         ISABELLE
          Mother sent some food. There are
          cakes and a pot of butter --

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't come in here.
          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm not hungry right now.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you sure? You sound so weak.

                         THE FIGURE
          I just made myself a stew. I left
          it over the fire for you.
          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.

                         ISABELLE
          I came here to take care of you.
          Not the other way around.

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't be silly, my dear. You've
          been through so much. Sit down.
          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

                         THE FIGURE
          There's no burden so heavy that it
          doesn't seem a little lighter on a
          full stomach.

                         ISABELLE

                         (SMILES)
          You always say that.
          She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat
          looks up from its grooming, watching her...

                         THE FIGURE
          That's right. Eat up, my dear.
          Eat up.
          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.

                         ISABELLE
          I've been worried about you. When
          you didn't come back yesterday, I
          was afraid...

                         (BEAT)
          You were wrong about Henri.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         THE FIGURE
          Was I now?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. He saved my life.
          Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She
          puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...

                         ISABELLE
          I feel hot all of a sudden.

                         THE FIGURE
          It's just the stew warming you.
          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a
          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks
          of white meat...

                         ISABELLE
          What is this...?

                         THE FIGURE
          If you don't like it, there's wine
          on the table to wash it down.
          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

                         THE FIGURE
          Oh, what pretty red lips. Come
          and give your Granny a kiss, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think I want to.

                         THE FIGURE
          Then I will come to you.
          And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She
          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller
          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the
          Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles
          into the firelight, revealing its face...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled.

                         ISABELLE
          What is this? Where's
          Grandmother?

                         CESAIRE
          I'm afraid I ate most of her.

                         (BEAT)
          You ate the rest.
          Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified
          look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out.

                         CESAIRE
          I didn't want to kill her. But
          she finally realized what I was.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The hardest thing to hide has
          always been the smell. The
          werewolf musk is strong,
          especially close to the full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods,
          clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He
          sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along
          by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Henri smelled it the night he saw
          me. And he recognized the smell
          later.

          EXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles
          outside and practically runs right into Cesaire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          He thought it was your
          Grandmother. He didn't know he
          was smelling me. But she did.
          She'd lived with the smell her
          whole life, she just had no way of
          knowing what it was.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Once she realized what it was, of
          course, she knew the truth. She
          tried to sneak a message to Father
          Auguste last night.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He
          quickly looks inside them and finds a note: 'œMEUS FILIUS
          EST LUPUS.'� Subtitle: 'œMy son is the wolf.'�

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Luckily, she'd taught me how to
          read.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.

                         ISABELLE
          You're not the Wolf. You can't
          be...

                         CESAIRE
          Look into my eyes. The one part
          of me I can never change.
          Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror.

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie?
          You killed my sister?

                         CESAIRE
          I did more than that to her.
          Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls.

                         CESAIRE
          I only wish your mother could have
          known what I did to her. The girl
          she passed off as my daughter.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the festival. SCREAMS can be heard coming
          from the village square. Suzette runs outside...

                         CONTINUED:

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I was made a cuckold by your
          mother. But I paid her back.
          She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the
          Wolf. It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The wolf hunt. Adrien hears SOMETHING move in the brush.
          He looks toward it... and sees the Wolf staring at him
          from the darkness.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I paid her lover back, too.

          BACK TO SCENE
          To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Lucie was the joy of my life. But
          she wasn't mine.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, she was. In every way that
          matters, she was.

                         CESAIRE
          No. Not in every way that
          matters. My father sired me. I
          am a werewolf because it was in
          his blood. Because I was his.

                         ISABELLE
          Did Grandmother know?

                         CESAIRE
          No. And neither does your mother.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          The night Lucie died. Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but
          this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer
          before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I put an herb in the beer to make
          you sleep whenever the moon was
          full. One of your Grandmother's
          old remedies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Many years ago. Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a
          chair, holding an empty cup. Isabelle's GRANDFATHER
          takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves.
          Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          That's how my father got away with
          it. Your grandmother never
          learned the truth. Until last
          night.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Still many years ago. A werewolf runs through the
          woods... followed by a smaller werewolf.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I began to turn when I was
          fourteen. My father and I ran
          together. We hunted freely.
          Killing at will.
          The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT,
          moving in for the kill...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered. A
          group of MEN stands around it.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Our only mistake was that we
          gorged ourselves too often on the
          fat flesh of the villagers.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The two werewolves are running through the woods again,
          this time chased by VILLAGERS with torches and weapons.

                         CESAIRE
          They killed my father.
          Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled
          with sharp stakes. It CRIES OUT in agony. The smaller
          werewolf looks down and WHIMPERS...
          ... watching as the larger werewolf begins to change
          before our eyes. It's reverting to its human form...

                         CONTINUED:
          By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find
          is Grandfather's naked body skewered on the stakes. The
          smaller werewolf GROWLS at them and runs away.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The fools thought my father had
          been thrown in the pit by the
          Wolf. They never suspected that
          he was the Wolf.

          SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)
          Cesaire labors in a field. He goes to church. He
          thatches the roof of his cottage in the hot sun...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I tried to live as my father did,
          but I came to realize that I did
          not belong here. The Wolf was my
          true self. It wasn't something to
          be hidden. It was a gift. I had
          to leave here and never return.

          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire stands in the cemetery, looking down at his
          father's grave...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But I did not want to go alone.
          My father and I were part of a
          long and powerful bloodline. It
          was up to me to see that it did
          not die out. I had hoped for a
          son to pass my gift on to.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire mends a fence, but keeps glancing at something...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Instead, God gave me daughters.
          He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle. They help Suzette
          hang clothes to dry. He smiles as he watches them...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But female werewolves are not
          born. They are made. And I chose
          my eldest.
          Lucie catches him watching. She waves. He waves back.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Another day. Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture.
          Lucie's face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          When I finally decided to leave, I
          told Lucie the truth. And I gave
          her a choice. She could come with
          me. Or I would take you instead.
          Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching. We realize
          that we've seen this moment before.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          She agreed to come with me. She
          did it to protect you.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Lucie sneaks out of bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          We arranged to meet on the night
          of the next full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Lucie stands naked, arms clutched around her breasts.
          Then, a NOISE in the brush. She turns and sees...

                         CESAIRE
          She was not a werewolf yet. I had
          to turn her.
          ... the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of
          bloody meat dangling from its jaws.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Later. Lucie weeps as she forces herself to eat the raw
          meat scraps. The Wolf watches, panting...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          First, she had to eat human flesh.
          I fed her from a kill I had made
          the month before. But the ritual
          was not yet complete. She had to
          be bitten by a male werewolf.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle looks like she's going to be ill.

                         CESAIRE
          The bite should have changed her.
          It should have made her like me.
          But it didn't. That's when I
          knew. There was no werewolf blood
          in her. I was not her father. I
          was so angry. I killed her before
          I even realized I was doing it.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire sits slumped in a corner, too drunk to move. A
          hand reaches in to help him. It's Isabelle.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Afterwards, I thought about
          killing myself. The only thing
          that kept me alive was you.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle helps drunk Cesaire into bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          You were so beautiful. So kind.
          And I knew you were mine. That's
          why you could understand me when
          no one else could. You were mine.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Cesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go. She
          backs into the wall. He looms over her...

                         CESAIRE
          Do you see now? This is your
          heritage. This is what you are.
          Everything I have done has been to
          insure the future of our

                         CESAIRE (CONT'D)
          like my father and I once did.
          You are the next generation. You
          have had your first taste of human
          flesh. Now one bite from me is
          all that is needed to change you.
          It will only hurt for a moment.
          And then you will be as I am.

                         ISABELLE
          There must indeed be a God. For
          you are surely the Devil...

                         CESAIRE
          I will give you a choice. Come
          with me now. Or refuse me and let
          your friends suffer in your place.
          I will kill them one by one. Your
          mother. Roxanne. Peter.
          Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases
          her. She walks over to the table, her back to him. She
          eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles
          in it. A long beat. Isabelle chokes back tears.

                         ISABELLE
          Father...?
          He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand
          on her shoulder. Her skin crawls.

                         CESAIRE
          Yes, my dear?

                         ISABELLE
          You gave me two choices.
          She turns to face him. Looks up at him.

                         ISABELLE
          But I have thought of a third.
          Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into
          Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to
          his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers.
          CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table.
          The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore...
          They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his
          knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open.
          Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might
          have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor,
          staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of
          rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cottage is dark and quiet.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          It's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door.

          PETER (O.S.)
          Hello?
          No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
          opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal
          Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's
          screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger
          and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle
          provides the only light. A long beat.

                         ISABELLE
          People should know what he was.

                         PETER
          We can't tell anyone. If they
          don't believe you, they'll hang
          you for this. And if they do
          believe you, they'll hang you for
          being the daughter of the Wolf.

                         ISABELLE
          Then I'll run away. I was ready
          to run away last night.

                         (BEAT)
          Why didn't you come for me?
          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a
          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.

                         PETER
          I was bitten at the festival. I
          spent last night in the woods
          because I was afraid of what might
          happen...

                         (A BEAT)
          I changed. I'm like him now.

                         ISABELLE
          No, you're not. You could never
          be like him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.

                         PETER
          I can't stay here.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, you can. We can still be
          together. My father lived here.
          My grandfather lived here.

                         PETER
          Your father and your grandfather
          killed people. They couldn't help
          themselves. If I stay here, I
          won't be able to control myself.
          (off her look)
          I have to be alone.
          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The
          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.

                         PETER
          We could take him to the river.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want him ever found.

                         PETER
          We'll weight him with rocks.

                         ISABELLE
          No. We'll put the rocks inside
          him.
          (off his look)
          Cut him open. I will sew the
          rocks inside him.
          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next
          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes
          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter
          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder
          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CONTINUED:
          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's
          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.
          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.

          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT

          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame
          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs
          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.
          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a
          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in
          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove
          off, but Isabelle stops him:

                         ISABELLE
          Wait.
          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his
          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting
          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them
          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.
          Peter gives her a questioning look.

                         ISABELLE
          These belonged to my grandmother.
          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he
          does... something begins to shine through in the
          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.

                         PETER
          They're silver.

          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.
          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in
          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...
          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the
          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.

                         PETER
          Death was too good for him.

                         ISABELLE
          I can live with it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and
          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last
          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.

                         ISABELLE
          Where will you go?

                         PETER
          I don't know. I need to
          understand what I've become.
          Maybe I can learn to control it.
          (off her look)
          I'll take my own life before I
          take another's.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.

                         PETER
          I'm not coming back. I don't want
          you to wait for me. This is the
          last time you'll ever see me.

                         ISABELLE
          No, it isn't. You'll be in my
          dreams until the day I die.
          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.

                         PETER
          You know, Henri is a good man.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, he is.
          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I never saw him again.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with
          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers
          bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Life in my village was changed
          forever. There were many
          questions and few answers. In the

          end, the Wolf did not return. And
          that was answer enough for most.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're
          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and
          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Henri and I were married. He was
          a good man and a good father. I
          loved him very much. But I never
          loved him the same way that I
          loved Peter. That was the one
          secret in our marriage.

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing
          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.
          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I only tell you now because he is
          dead. And if he knows now, I
          believe that he forgives me, for
          he must also know that I never
          loved him falsely.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,
          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed
          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          This is my story, not that I
          expect you will believe it. In my
          own village, the events of that
          awful winter have already passed
          into legend. Parents tell their
          children to be good or else the
          Wolf will come and gobble them up.
          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          They've already forgotten. A
          simple children's story is all
          that remains.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But I often wonder if I hear him.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
