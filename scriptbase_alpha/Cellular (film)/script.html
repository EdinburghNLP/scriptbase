<b>
</b>
<b>TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
</b>We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer.

<b>INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
</b>We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.

<b>                     WOMAN
</b>               (into phone)
          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.

<b>                     WOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Just inform Kayleigh that
          anesthesia is on the way to prep
          the epidural and I'll be there as
          soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.

<b>                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          And promise her she's about to have
          a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.

<b>                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.

<b>                     JESSICA
</b>          Buenas dias, Rosario.

<b>
</b>
<b>                      ROSARIO
</b>           Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

<b>                 MALE VOICE
</b>           (on machine)
           Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

<b>                     LEAD GUNMAN
</b>          Get away from there! Don't touch
          that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.

<b>                 LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          (dire)
          Where is he?
Jessica cringes.

<b>                     JESSICA
</b>          Where is who?

<b>                     LEAD GUNMAN
</b>          Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.

<b>                     LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:

<b>                CRAIG VO
</b>          (on machine)
          -I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.

<b>                                            MATCH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>
</b>
<b>EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
</b>The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--

<b>                                     WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:
</b>
<b>INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
</b>A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

<b>THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
</b>Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.

<b>                     JESSICA
</b>          Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

<b>                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>          No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

<b>                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          NO!   PLEASE--//
</b>SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--

<b>
</b>
<b>                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>            Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>THE OCEAN
</b>Skimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

<b>PIER.
</b>
<b>EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
</b>It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

<b>INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
</b>The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.

<b>                       RYAN
</b>            You recording this?

<b>                       CHAD (OS)
</b>            Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.

<b>
</b>
<b>                       RYAN
</b>            Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

<b>                        KID
</b>            Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

<b>                        RYAN
</b>            Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

<b>                       CHAD
</b>            Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
            Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

<b>                      RYAN
</b>            C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
            that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

<b>                        CHAD
</b>                 (through cup-holding
                  teeth)
            Sweet. It's going to my email
            right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.

<b>                       RYAN
</b>            Watch it dude, I gotta return that
            thing in seven days.

<b>                       CHAD
</b>            They aren't giving you shit yet?

<b>                       RYAN
</b>            Nah, whenever I return it, I just
            list off why the phone sucks and
            they give me a new model. Figure
            by the tenth time I'll have to go
            somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE OCEAN
</b>As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.

<b>
</b>RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.

<b>                      CHAD
</b>           Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.

<b>                 CHAD (CONT'D)
</b>           (re: wallet)
           Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

<b>                     RYAN
</b>          Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.

<b>                     RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>          This is stupid. I could get
          killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

<b>                     CHAD
</b>          My ass. Not after you made me
          march in the Gay Pride Parade
          wearing a thong.

<b>                     RYAN
</b>          Screw it then. In one... Two...
          Two and a half--

<b>                     CHAD
</b>          Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.

<b>                    CHAD (CONT'D)
</b>          Just so you know, I'm emailing this
          to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--

<b>                CHAD (CONT'D)
</b>          (speaking like HAL 900)
          Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.

<b>

<b>                      RYAN
</b>           Got any more? I'm here to help.

<b>                      CHLOE
</b>           Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

<b>                      RYAN
</b>           What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

<b>                      RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Cool, you're handing these out
           during the concert?

<b>                     CHLOE
</b>          Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

<b>                       RYAN
</b>          Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the
          Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

<b>                     RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
          thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

<b>                     RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>          We've collected water samples with
          the Stream Team, raised money on
          the Promenade... I'm surprised I
          haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.

<b>                       RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Ryan.
She takes it.

<b>                       CHLOE
</b>          Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

<b>                     CHLOE (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

<b>                     RYAN
</b>          You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
          My dad used to take me there all

</b>           the time. Their pier is amazing,
           clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
           oysters right there on the rocks,
           starfish... Hard to believe it's
           the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.

<b>                     CHLOE
</b>           Maybe you and I can take a break
           later when Pat Benatar goes on.

<b>                      RYAN
</b>           Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --

<b>                     CHLOE
</b>          Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
          pick up a box of T-shirts at the
          Kinkos on Venice.

<b>                     RYAN
</b>           I'll do it for you... if you want.

<b>                    CHLOE
</b>          Seriously, you would?

<b>                       RYAN
</b>          Sure.     How much is the bill?

<b>                       CHLOE
</b>          Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

<b>                    RYAN
</b>          Do you promise not to go anywhere?

<b>                       CHLOE
</b>          Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

<b>                     RYAN
</b>          Okay, I won't be long.

<b>                CHLOE
</b>          (laughing)
          Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

<b>                    RYAN
</b>          Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
          harbor or a pier?

neighborhood.

<b>
</b>Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.

<b>                      RYAN

away angrily.

The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

     YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan
     hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides
     "screw it", and keeps on hoofing.
     Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
     Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

<b>                          GYM TEACHER

               sec! This is a huuuge
               misunderstanding--
     A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
     up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly
     leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

               father bought him a Lord of the
               Rings lunchbox last week!
     Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
     with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school
     steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

         Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs

     in the corner, boasting about an arrest.

               I'm about to open a closet door
               when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out
               of the bathroom. He shoots.
               Misses me and hits one of the
               E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun
               jams and BAM! Blows half his face
               off. Had enough black tar heroin
               in the closet to resurface the 405.
     Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.

     Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through
     the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of

     Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,

     He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
     antenna in his teeth.
     There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly

     OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and

     Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and

     brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
     Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
     or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
     the window with the .38 Special.
     Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the

     on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the

     As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
     enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of

     into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.
     Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.
     Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that
     we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands
     innocently the next line over--

</b>      There's an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office.
      One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
      envelopes, another bin is overflowing with small mailers,
      computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc...

      opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
      down -- and a DVD case slides out!
      A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.

      Feigning frustration.

      The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
      Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal
      is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
      at the end of the hall.

      Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

</b>                Sir?
      Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.
      At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the
      door --

      A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
      suddenly realizes: This is the guy!
      It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

<b>                           MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)

      Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a
      metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

<b>                 WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!

      drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
      Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their
      lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has
      come to life; drawing down on them.

<b>                           SECURITY GUARD

</b>
<b>                FREEZE!!

      -The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig
      again!
      BANG! -- Greer fires.
      Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.
      They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly
      shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

      DIVES into:

</b>      With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks
      fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the
      In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and
      starts running UP.
      Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards
      sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

      The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a
      hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.
      Peeking over the edge from the floor above--

<b>      RYAN

      Shit.'
      THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell
      on every floor.
      Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
      until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
      open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
      He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

</b>      GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door
      swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up
      toward the-

</b>      Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
      here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,
      PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial

<b>      AIR CONDITIONER...
</b>      Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
      Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
      down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
      Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
      behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

<b>125   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    125
</b>      GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.     He and Hodges explode out onto
      the roof, looking for Ryan.
      Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
      behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.

<b>                           GREER
</b>                     (to Hodges)
                Here.
      Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-
      covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.
      This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
      But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

<b>                             GREER (CONT'D)
</b>                Dammit!
      No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that
      leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on
      ground level.

<b>
</b>
<b>                                                                      78.

      Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
      be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

<b>      THE ALARM STOPS.
</b>      Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
      sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He
      eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

</b>      RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries
      to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the

<b>      ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
</b>      From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

      But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to
      discuss Craig.

</b>      Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it
      toward the open mouth of the chute...

</b>      Ryan holds his breath.    Trembling.   His leg threatening to
      rabbit-foot again.
      Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:

<b>                             JESSICA
</b>                  You have to talk to me! Ryan,

      The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he
      catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the
      stressed metal.
      Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
      the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
      Desperate to console her, Ryan --
      BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
      up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
      He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses
      himself to one side but --
      WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

      with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a

      HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,
      shattering it in a million pieces around her.
      Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she
      struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

             There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
             responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
             flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
             fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
             Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
             to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
             as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
             flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
             arm.
             Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
             as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

             looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
             sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
             the floor like a river.
             Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

      starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:

</b>      Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She

      But Mooney's not there.

      Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further
      into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

      into the yard --

<b>                           SIMON COWELL
</b>                Wait, wait! All right you bloody

                even the slightest scratch on it...
      Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell
      angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the
      switch to open the gate, and as it opens--
      Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling
      Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --
      VRRRROOOM!!    Ryan burns rubber out of there.

          Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the

      a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
      The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
      Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.

<b>                            TOMLIN
</b>                 Shoulda stayed at home this
                 morning, kid.
      And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
      Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else.

      turns and--

      RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH
      and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to
      rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is
      obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
      Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
      and high-tailing it out of there.
