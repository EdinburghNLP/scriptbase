<b>                                  WATCHMEN
</b>


                                 Written by

                           David Hayter &amp; Alex Tse





<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING
</b>
          CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises
          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.
          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE
          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his
          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome
          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.
          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian
          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific
          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He
          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits
          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          --addressing the United Nations today,
          the President expressed his concern over
          the increasingly intense territorial
          disputes in both Asia and the Middle
          East.
          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--

<b>          PRESIDENT
</b>          The sound of a bullet at one end of the
          world echoes across the ocean to the
          other end. Armed conflict is not self
          contained in its respective region--the
          consequences reverberate through every
          nation across the world and therefore
          must be avoided at all costs.
          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          While the President's position was clear,
          he did not comment on whether or not he
          would order Dr. Manhattan into action
          should the situation continue to
          escalate.
          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he
          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads
          straight for him.

<b>          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.
          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.
          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the
          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--
          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--
          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
          jumps up, immediately at the ready--
          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake
          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see
          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          Just a matter of time, I suppose.
          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from
          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The
          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,
          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER
          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro
          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot
          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out
          of Blake's hand--
          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder
          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like
          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much
          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to
          the head.
          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake
          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in
          the eye
          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.

<b>          BLAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          I always thought I knew the punchline.
          But I guess the joke's on me now.
          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--
          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a
          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>
<b>          EXT. STREET - EVENING
</b>
          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
          DRIPS on it
          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)
</b>
          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.

<b>          COP 1
</b>          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!

<b>          SHOPKEEPER
</b>          It's been over four hours, I got a
          business to run--
          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
          the water carries it to a DRAIN--
          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
          We never see his face. We move from his POV--
          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
          New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
          Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
          with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"
          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.

<b>          NEWS VENDOR
</b>          (re: headlines)
          Depressing ain't it?

<b>          MAN
</b>          But good for business, right?

<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>          NEWS VENDOR
</b>          Yeah. Irony's a bitch.
          The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the
          News Vendor on the shoulder.

<b>          HOMELESS MAN
</b>          The current issue of The New
          Frontiersman, where is it?

<b>          NEWS VENDOR
</b>          It's late this month.

<b>          HOMELESS MAN
</b>          When will it be here?

<b>          NEWS VENDOR
</b>          I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late--
          We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
          building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
          window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)
          and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk
          through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window.

<b>          DET. FINE
</b>          Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.
          A solid 225, guy was built like a
          linebacker. This is plate glass too,
          you'd have to step on the gas just to put
          a crack in this. Had to be a two man job.
          At least. You check the bedroom?

<b>          DET. GALLAGHER
</b>          Drawers were open, tossed through.
          Mattress flipped.

<b>          DET. FINE
</b>          Robbery?

<b>          DET. GALLAGHER
</b>          Or made to look like one.
          (tosses Fine an ID)
          Found that in the bedroom.
          Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It
          reads "Special Advisor, United States."

</b>
<b>          DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)
</b>          You see this?
          He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine.

<b>          DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Shaking hands with the President.

<b>          DET. FINE
</b>          You're saying this guy was a spook? You
          think this might be a political murder?

<b>          DET. GALLAGHER
</b>          I think that this is way bigger
          than the both of us.
          He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC

<b>          SHEETING.
</b>
<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)
</b>          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
          Earlier today I came across what appeared
          to be a suicide. It was later learned to
          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
          person whose POV we were in earlier.

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I discovered a clue. Something I
          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
          . I heard my own clock ticking.
          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
          Rorschach test. Scary looking.
          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic
          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He
          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops
          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one
          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.
          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the
          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun
          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)

<b>          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his
          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the
          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.
          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,
          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED
          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in
          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he
          was a superhero.
          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,
          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.
          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.
          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current
          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it
          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.
          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE
          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last
          Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in
          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero
          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian
          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)
          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of
          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,
          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and
          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The
          caption below reads: "The New Watchmen."
          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly
          closes the secret hatch.

          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.
          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:

<b>          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.
          Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--
          --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
          away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes
          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"--
          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and
          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.

          CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to
          the old one in Blake's closet. Holding the photo is HOLLIS
          MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don't see his face yet.

<b>          HOLLIS (O.S.)
</b>          He was young and arrogant, but what he

          As he speaks, we PAN ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The
          first is a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING dated 1958: MYSTERIOUS MASKED
          MAN CLEANS UP WHARFS--the caption underneath reads "Hero

          to dress up and pull heists, crap like
          that.

          these guys on at the street level, right?
          Then the media got wind, ran with it,
          turned it into a whole different beast.
          PAN ACROSS: A GOLD STATUE of NITE OWL in his Sixties-era
          costume. The plaque below reads: IN GRATITUDE, 1969. Another
          clipping: "Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book."
          Finally, we come to HOLLIS MASON (aka Nite Owl), 70s, though
          his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the
          edges of a born hero. The TV is on in the background.

          Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go
          the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the
          photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment.

          MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him.
          ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far.

</b>          I said move, dick.
          Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his
          eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The
          Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.

          Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for
          his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert.
          His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED.
          There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.

<b>          INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find--

          at the same time, Dan is wary.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You were on the news. They say you

          shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor--

</b>          Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the

</b>
<b>          DAN
</b>          Just tell him I'm here. I assure you
          he'll see me.
          Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken.
          She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office.
          Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by
          nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him--
          it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS
          eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.

<b>          INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Dan enters the enormous office--there are three TV feeds
          PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate
          developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia"
          perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt
          Enterprises owned by--
          --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
          of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG
          ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan
          approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan
          to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks
          up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
          are considered the world's smartest man?

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>
<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          I think it's better to be the world's
          most modest man. You should ignore my PR
          people, they tend to be a little too
          enthusiastic.
          Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
          seems out of breath as he answers questions.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          If we could move off the subject of
          business for a moment, I'm curious
          whether the world's smartest man thinks
          we're headed for our next World War.
          Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Predicting stock prices isn't the same as
          predicting world events. I hope there
          isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that
          matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has
          some exciting plans, plans that will,
          pardon the cliche, truly make this world
          a better place. My team of engineers and
          scientists have been working with Dr.
          Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new,
          cheap form of energy which will eliminate
          the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with
          no toxic emissions. This energy could
          power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there

</b>          You look good, Adrian.

          Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an
          ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias).

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.

<b>          DAN
</b>          He did? Must've been tough to get past

</b>
<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          Sara can be tough. Is that why you came
          to see me? You're worried about this mask

<b>          DAN
</b>          You're the world's smartest man, Adrian.
          You tell me.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through

          public as soon as the Keene Act was
          passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it
          would have been done already.
          Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
          Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian
          border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim.

          A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER
          MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the
          gate.
          We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The
          guard has no reaction to Rorschach--
          --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
          Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The
          Guard waves him through.

<b>          INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING

          Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask
          on. He quietly enters--

          --a huge room, which contains technologically advanced

          works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air--
          not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan
          already knew he was coming.

</b>          Dr. Manhattan.
          Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
          girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime,
          enters from the other end.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What
          are you doing here? You're a wanted man.

</b>          Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

</b>          Yes, since he and I are the only two
          extranormal operatives currently employed
          by the government, I was informed. The
          CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic

          Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
          speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          I have my own theories. But neither of

</b>          A live human body and a dead human body

          --of Dan and Laurie as they finish up their meal at this
          trendy restaurant.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          You remember that crazy guy, what did he
          call himself . Captain Carnage!
          Pretended to be a supervillian just so he
          could get beat up all the time?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just
          walked away but he starts following me
          down the street in broad daylight
          yelling, "punish me! punish me!"

<b>          LAURIE
</b>
<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          Whatever happened to him?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and
          Rorschach dropped him down an elevator
          shaft.
          They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't
          remember the last time I laughed like
          this. It feels good.
          Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's
          smitten with her and that he probably has been for years.
          Laurie seems oblivious.

<b>          DAN
</b>          It's great seeing you again, Laurie.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Yeah, this was fun.
          The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You sure I can't get that?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Let me put my expense account to use. You
          can thank Uncle Sam.

          SEDAN parked outside.

<b>          DAN
</b>          They've been watching the whole time?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Just making sure I'm not doing anything
          that might upset the country's most
          powerful weapon.

<b>          DAN
</b>          How is Jon, by the way?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          I really don't know. It's been harder and
          harder to tell over the years. It's like
          his emotions are slowly eroding. To be
          honest, I can't tell if he even cares
          about me anymore.
          They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch.

<b>          LAURIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I should get back.

</b>
          Dan and Laurie step outside.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do
          it? Why did we dress up like that? I
          think the Keene Act was the best thing to
          ever happen to us.

<b>          DAN
</b>          You're probably right.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          I mean, you remember my costume? All that
          tight spandex? That was awful.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Uh, yeah. Awful.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          And to think my own mother pushed me into
          that spandex. Pushed me into the whole
          costume thing in the first place. Wanted
          her little girl to be just like mommy and
          fight bad guys.

</b>          We'll do this again.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Yeah. I'd really like that.
          Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan
          watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him,
          running around playing. The Kids make flying noises.

<b>          KID 1
</b>          I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin

          Days later. A few mourners gather in the rain for Edward
          Blake aka The Comedian's funeral. Mostly government types.
          Dan, Adrian and Dr. Manhattan line the edge of an open grave.

          Laurie MATERIALIZES in the hallway of her mother's condo in
          California. She immediately runs to the bathroom.

</b>
          Bright California sunshine gleams over this upscale condo
          facility. Laurie's mother, SALLY, 60s but looks in her 40s,
          reclines by the POOL. She hears someone VOMITING in her
          condo.

<b>          SALLY
</b>          Laurie? Is that you?

          Sally steps through the sliding glass doors as we hear the

</b>          Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon
          teleports me.

<b>          SALLY
</b>          Margarita?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          No.
          Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the
          counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her
          crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of
          margaritas is a days old LA Times with the headline: "Dr.
          Manhattan Intercepts Terrorists At Port."

<b>          SALLY
</b>          It's Eddie Blake's funeral today, isn't
          it?
          Laurie nods. (From here on, intercut between Blake's funeral
          and Sally's condo)
          FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is removed from the hearse.

<b>          SALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor
          Eddie.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After
          what he--

</b>          Laurie, you're still young. You don't
          understand how things change as time goes
          by.

          Manhattan.

<b>          LAURIE (V.0.)
</b>          Another lesson on time passing. Y'know,
          you and Jon should get together and write
          a book on the subject.
          Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of
          the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it.

          A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His

<b>          BLAKE (CONT'D)
</b>          You'd think this country'd had enough

</b>          This is all bullshit.
          Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the
          meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a
          teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr.
          Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend
          JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young
          Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays
          Laurie attention, but she is oblivious.
          A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          What are you saying, Comedian?
          Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table,
          a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders
          Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."'

<b>          BLAKE
</b>          What I'm saying is this whole bringing
          back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It
          didn't work twenty years ago, and it
          ain't gonna work just because you want to
          keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Maybe we should agree on no drinking at
          meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made
          real headway on the gang problem by
          pooling our efforts.
          Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          That's true. But something like this
          seems too big. Too bureaucratic.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Bureaucracies can be effective with the

          of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering apologies to
          Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames

<b>          PRIEST
</b>          Lord have mercy upon us. Amen.
          Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a
          moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start
          filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in
          the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away.

          The Lone Man leaves quickly.

<b>          INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered.
          He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a
          supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news
          clipping in Blake's closet.

<b>          INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
          Moloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops,
          staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up--
          in spiky handwriting it reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As
          Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his
          back and SLAMS him to the floor.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar
          William Vaughn. Also known as William
          Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not
          Moloch anymore. What do you want from me?
          Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          You attended a funeral today. Why?

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          The funeral? I don't know why I went. I
          just felt I should. I'd been thinking
          about the Comedian--
          Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          How did you know Blake was the Comedian?

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had
          his mask off. He was drunk--

</b>          The Comedian? Crying?

<b>          MOLOCH

</b>          Something he saw, I think. He said
          something about wishing he never broke
          into that building. But that he had to
          keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left!
          Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable.
          Probably true.
          Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers,
          looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through
          it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from
          "Pyramid Industries."

</b>          So that's it? I'm clean?

<b>          RORSCHACH

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          Illegal--I don't use drugs.
          Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Laetril. Phony medication made from
          apricot pits. Illegal.

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          oh c-come on. Look, please don't
          confiscate that. I'm trying anything
          . I have cancer.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          What kind of cancer?

<b>          MOLOCH
</b>          The kind you don't get better from.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If

          note in the trash can opposite the Gunga

</b>          Blake understood. Humans are violent in
          nature. No matter how much you try to
          dress it up, to disguise it.
          FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          Geneva Convention comes up, our official
          position is that talks will not resume
          until the Chinese agree to exclude you
          from the agenda. The President approved
          this interview because he wanted to
          strengthen morale at home and to gently
          remind the rest of the world who holds
          the cards. Please keep that in mind.
          Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up
          and we're live with the glossy NEWS HOST.

</b>          He's been called many things; Hero,
          weapon, linchpin of our security--
          CUT TO: Dan and Laurie turning as the Young Thugs BLOCK THE
          ALLEYWAY. One of the Thugs pulls a KNIFE. Laurie and Dan
          exchange a look. Dan removes his glasses. CUT BACK TO:

<b>          NEWS HOST (CONT'D)
</b>          His given name is Jonathan Osterman--Dr.
          Jonathan Osterman--a renowned nuclear
          physicist who through a terrible accident
          became the man the world knows today as
          Dr. Manhattan.
          The audience APPLAUDS loudly as Dr. Manhattan takes his seat.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Thank you.

<b>          NEWS HOST
</b>          Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply
          for appearing on this program. I believe
          I speak for all of America when I thank
          you for thwarting the terrorist plot at
          the port of Long Beach over a week ago--
          Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan
          regards curiously.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          It was my duty.
           CUT TO: Dan and Laurie surrounded by the Thugs . when
          suddenly they DIVE INTO the group, fighting like the heroes
          they once were.
          Dan grapples with one of the Thugs and knocks his knife away--
          --when another Thug nails him from behind with a BAT. Dan
          drops to the ground . BACK TO:

<b>          NEWS HOST
</b>          Before we start, I want to explain to our
          viewers the unconventional format for
          this interview. Our live audience is made
          up entirely of news media and Dr.
          Manhattan will be taking questions from
          the floor. This commercial free broadcast
          is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises.
          We see Adrian standing near the audience with the Press
          Agent, smiling for the camera.

          another Thug GRABS HER HAIR.

<b>          NEWS HOST (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          We will now take our first question--
          The Thug draws a PISTOL on her. Dan, still on the ground,
          sees the gun and his eyes narrow, harden. He pushes himself
          up off the ground.
          CUT BACK TO: The TV Studio AUDIENCE: where Doug Roth, the
          journalist who interviewed Adrian earlier, stands.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do
          you remember a man named Wally Weaver?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes, he was a good friend of mine. When
          we were both physicists.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          He died of cancer.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I remember. I attended his funeral.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the
          supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of
          battles with him, didn't you? Did you
          know that he has cancer as-well?
          The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press
          Agent, growing concerned with where this is leading.
          CUT TO: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN'S wrist back and up--
          Barrel aimed at the Thug's CHIN. In the last fraction of a
          second, Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES,
          deafening the Thug, but leaving him alive. BACK TO:

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I was not aware--

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          And what about Jose Flores? He was the
          longtime janitor at the Watchmen
          Headquarters where you worked for many
          years. Cancer.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          By your line of questioning, you're
          suggesting that I was the cause of cancer
          in these individuals.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          You tell me, doc.
          Adrian turns to him.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Doug, that `s enough.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          It is irrelevant whether I was the cause
          or not.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Irrelevant?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          A live human body and a dead human body
          have the same number of particles.
          Structurally there's no difference.
          An appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience.

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          What about Janey Slater? Do you think it
          makes a difference to her?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Janey Slater? Wh--

<b>          DOUG ROTH
</b>          Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist
          too. You were with her for ten years. Or
          does she have to remind you herself?
          Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the
          stands. She is old now, frail, barely recognizable from the
          images we've see of her.

<b>          DOUG ROTH (CONT'D)
</b>          She has cancer as well. Doctors have
          given her six months. What do you have to
          say, Ms. Slater?
          He sticks the microphone in her face.

          In the audience, Adrian turns to the Press Agent, frantic.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          We need to stop this now.
          Adrian and the Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY
          following.

<b>          PRESS AGENT
</b>          That's it! Interview's over!
          BACK TO: The alley, littered with the unconscious BODIES of
          the Thugs. Laurie and Dan lean back on the wall, gasping for
          air, horribly out of shape, but victorious.
          CUT TO: The TV studio, as Adrian and Security surround Dr.
          Manhattan, trying to escort him out. The audience spills out
          of the stands, RUSHING Dr. Manhattan with questions and,
          FLASHING cameras--it's madness. Adrian shoves a camera out of
          Dr. Manhattan's face.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          As the sponsor of this program I demand
          all cameras off!
          His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through,
          gets in Dr. Manhattan's face.

<b>          REPORTER 1
</b>          Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by
          sleeping with her?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          No. Please let me through

          and leave me alone.

          Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS--

</b>          I said LEAVE ME ALONE!
          Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr.

          down. The cab stops at a red light; The CABBIE takes outa

          like she stares at the flame here, as Adrian's display

          around the corner.

<b>          BLAKE (O.S.)

</b>          No. Not really.

          the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly.

<b>          SALLY (O.S.)

<b>          TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.

          INSIDE THE LIMO: Laurie cracks her window an inch. Her
          mother's harsh, low tone drifts clearly back.

<b>          SALLY (CONT'D)

          ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.

<b>          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)
</b>          The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries.
          So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr.
          Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And
          last time I was here, I saw a pension
          check sent to you from the same company--
          obviously a front set up by whoever it is
          that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr.
          Manhattan over the edge, that wants us
          masks dead. Is that why you left me a
          note in my mail drop? You have something
          to confess?
          Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes.
          A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead.
          Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's
          the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one
          that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU."
          Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          Today, police searched the apartment of
          Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked
          vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured
          last night and charged with the murder of
          Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the
          supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found
          shot in the head at point blank range.
          Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on
          the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES.

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Inside the decrepit apartment, police
          discovered stacks of right-wing
          literature, including several years of
          back issues of the ultra-conservative
          publication, "The New Frontiersman." We
          asked "New Frontiersman" editor, Hector
          Godfrey, for comment.
          CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We see
          Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background.

<b>          EDITOR
</b>          Rorschach is an American patriot and we
          are proud that he reads this publication.

<b>          ANCHORWOMAN
</b>          During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and
          severely injured at least nine police
          officers, shooting one officer with a
          grappling gun. That officer is in serious
          but stable condition.

<b>          ANCHORMAN
</b>          Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues
          to intensify. Both India and Pakistan
          alluded that the use of nuclear weapons
          is not out of the question--
          Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains
          away.

<b>          DAN
</b>          He wasn't always like that. We were a
          great team--tactically, he was brilliant.
          But I don't know, something about this
          murder charge I just can't see
          Rorschach shooting Moloch.

          Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the

          stares ahead. Silent. Calm.

          The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits

          Walter?

</b>          Let me explain your situation here,
          Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may
          be able to convince them that you should
          to be treated medically, in a hospital,

          FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER
          BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach
          just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his
          face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy
          like a wild animal--biting, clawing .

          Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one
          corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers
          inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's
          decorated with little hearts and bears.

<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)

          Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are
          fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES,
          CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling
          dogs get LOUDER.
          Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to
          the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED,
          DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His

          He tries the light in here. Nothing again. He turns away as

          He SCRAMBLES through the warehouse, falling over mannequins.
          He FIRES madly into the dark. The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM
          FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles
          backward against the stove.
          FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.

          destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If
          God saw what any of us did that night, he
          didn't seem to mind. From then on, I
          knew. God doesn't make the world this
          way. We do.
          The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.

</b>
          The Mess hall is PACKED, hundreds of INMATES eat dinner.
          Rorschach enters. The place goes instantly, heavily SILENT.
          Suddenly someone yells:

<b>          RANDOM VOICE
</b>          Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a
          whore!
          A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins
          again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE
          PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:

<b>          PRISONER
</b>          Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous,
          right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too.
          Maybe I can give you my autograph.
          The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve

          behind the counter to turn away--
          --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER
          BASKET from its mount--
          --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins,
          GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO
          THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and
          CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach.
          Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's
          screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once
          again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes
          of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks,
          his icy voice carrying easily.

          It's Laurie, waiting for him IN COSTUME. They kiss. She tears
          at him passionately. His SKIN suddenly TEARS AWAY like
          wrapping paper. Beneath the false skin, Dan wears his NITE-
          OWL COSTUME. Confident, he touches her face. She smiles with
          palpable heat. They kiss.

          skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of

          Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.

          Dan and Laurie are back in costume.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to
          rediscover your calling in life, but I
          think you're getting carried away. You're
          talking about springing a homicidal
          psychopath from prison.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's
          on to something--four heroes attacked in
          a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that
          whole cancer thing with ion, does that
          make sense to you? You didn't contract
          cancer from him.
          He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes
          her mind.

          Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is

          Ship is capable of the trip to
          Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine

          faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used

          a bullet. I believe he could. He could
          kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one

          life on life's terms. And yet you

          coupling, millions upon millions of cells
          compete to create life over generation
          after generation: Until finally, your
          mother loves a man--Edward Blake, the
          Comedian--a man she has every reason to
          hate. And out of that contradiction,
          against unfathomable odds, it was you,
          only you, that emerged. To distill so
          specific a form from all of that chaos;
          Your creation is like . turning air
          into gold. A miracle.

<b>          LAURIE

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Yes, anyone in the world. But the world

          Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters
          from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS before them.

<b>          RORSCHACH
</b>          The engines--

<b>          DAN

          Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.

<b>          EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN

          The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly.
          It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the

          The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS
          across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.

<b>          INT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN

          Dan opens the hatch. Shrieking WIND blows the snow in. Dan
          pulls on a white, FUR-LINED SNOW-OWL costume.

<b>          DAN
</b>          The engines are de-icing. You sure I

          Rorschach pulls up his trench-collar against the bitter wind.

          Adrian, dressed in his Ozymandias costume, sits alone in the
          massive hall, opposite a wall of giant PLASMA-SCREENS which
          show various television NEWS CHANNELS showing all the IMAGES

<b>          OF WAR IN THE WORLD.
</b>          Adrian sighs and hits the remote--the screens become ONE
          IMAGE--ALEXANDER THE GREAT slicing the Gordian Knot.
          By Adrian's feet is an exotic LYNX. Its unnatural beauty
          almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the
          beast.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          See this painting? Alexander the Great.
          Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he
          struck North for Gordium, where the
          world's greatest puzzle waited. A great
          knot, impossible to untie. For a young
          man determined to rule the world, it was
          a challenge he couldn't resist. So he
          sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral
          thinking, you see.
          Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          What is it, girl?
          He hits the remote--the TV screens switch to MULTIPLE VIEWS
          OF Dan and Rorschach, heading toward Karnak.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)

          As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a
          FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian
          effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS
          it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor.

<b>          ADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          I never intended to kill the Comedian--
          that was an accident. Part of his duties

          track of all former masked heroes, make
          sure there was no rocking of the boat. He
          must have liked Rorschach because he
          allowed him to continue to exist. I had
          thought that the Comedian might be
          incompetent, but he disproved that
          hypothesis when he discovered what was
          really going on. here in Karnak--no easy
          task. Even my staff was unaware--I made
          sure to keep each department separate.

</b>          The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but
          still, he understood the scope of what I
          was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I
          never thought he'd actually talk. But by
          the time he visited poor Moloch, he was
          cracking badly. So I had to kill him.

          steps in between, protecting its master.

</b>          After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan
          nearly a decade in the works after
          analyzing confidential psychological
          profiles which predicted his withdrawal
          from human existence. By then,
          Rorschach's mask theory, 'though
          erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I
          faked my own assassination--

<b>          DAN
</b>          Why take that risk? What if the hitman
          shot you first instead of your assistant?

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to
          catch the bullet then, wouldn't I?
          Adrian smiles enigmatically.

</b>          After apprehending my own assassin, I
          shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth,
          disposing of him, and soon after that,
          the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all
          the loose ends if you will. Then I knew

          safeguards gave me pause at the necessary
          sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct.
          What we were doing with the Watchmen was
          pointless--the savage nature of humankind
          would inevitably lead to the end of the
          world. So in order to save the world, I
          had to trick it--to frighten the world
          towards salvation with history's greatest
          practical joke.

          to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the BURN-MARK where
          Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears--
          --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in
          tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one
          a little less complicated.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Leaving? I, I thought you regained an
          interest in human life.

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          I have. I think maybe I'll create some.
          Goodbye, Laurie.
          He kisses her on the cheek--

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made
          myself feel every death, see every
          innocent face I've murdered to save
          humanity--you understand, don't you?

<b>          DR. MANHATTAN
</b>          Without condoning or condemning, I

<b>          UNDERSTAND
</b>          And with that, he disappears. Forever.

</b>          Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He
          stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward Adrian.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          What's on your mind, Dan?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Your death.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Really. You want to kill me?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Yeah. You might have created peace, but
          not at the expense of justice. You need
          to pay for what you've done.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That
          sounds more like Rorschach.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Exactly.
          Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV
          screens.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          Only you're not Rorschach, are you now?
          How do you expect to succeed where he
          failed?

<b>          DAN
</b>          Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't.
          Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life.
          His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is
          informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About
          justice. About life.
          But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with
          ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so
          focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final
          strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Dan!
          Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her
          attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor,
          knocking her out.

<b>          CONTINUED: (4)
</b>          Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out
          of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and
          finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he

<b>          FLICKS IT AT ADRIAN--
</b>          Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs.
          Prepares to finish Dan off.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          I have to say, I've always thought your
          choice of an owl was quite juvenile.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Really? I've always liked owls
          Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt.
          Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND
          falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE.

<b>          DAN (CONT'D)
</b>          because you can never hear them
          coming.
          BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL-
          SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan.
          Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor.
          Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered.
          Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a
          fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying.

<b>          ADRIAN
</b>          I . don't regret my actions. I know
          in my heart . I did the right thing.

<b>          DAN
</b>          So do I.
          Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies.

<b>          INT. OWL-SHIP - MORNING
</b>
          Dan sits painfully in the passenger seat, as Laurie tries to
          pilot the ship out of Adrian's bedroom.

<b>          DAN
</b>          That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick
          to the left
          The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out
          more glass.

          She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room.
          It's afterburners IGNITING the room, and Adrian's body.

<b>          EXT. ANTARCTICA - MORNING
</b>
          The Owl-Ship RISES into the sky, the Pyramid of Karnak
          BLAZING from it's tip like a Roman candle. Dan watches out
          the window, until his eyes slip shut

<b>          EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING (SOME TIME LATER)
</b>
          Time has passed. The disintegrated buildings are being
          rebuilt. The shock of the attack is wearing off, and though
          the streets may not be as crowded as they once were, a sense
          of normalcy is returning.
          Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address.

<b>          INT. DAN AND LAURIE'S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING
</b>
          Sally mixes herself a tall drink at the bar. Sally calls out:

<b>          SALLY
</b>          You sure you don't want a drink?

<b>          LAURIE (O.S.)
</b>          I'm okay. Thanks.
          We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed.

<b>          LAURIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Mom--I just want to get this out of the
          way . . I know Eddie Blake, the
          Comedian--I know he was my father.
          Sally freezes.

<b>          LAURIE (CONT'D)
</b>          I remember.
          Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another.

<b>          SALLY
</b>          It, it was years later, he stopped by out
          of the blue, and, and apologized. I don't
          know, I just couldn't stay mad. It
          just happened--
          Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek.

</b>          Mom. People's lives take them strange
          places. You never did anything wrong by
          me.
          Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.

<b>          SALLY
</b>          What the hell is that?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Oh that's Dan. Home from "work."
          The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the
          secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed
          with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Oh hi.

<b>          SALLY
</b>          Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up.
          Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom.
          Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Any bad guys last night?

<b>          DAN
</b>          There are always bad guys. Even in
          today's world.
          Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York
          skyline being rebuilt.

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Dan.

<b>          DAN
</b>          Hmm?

<b>          LAURIE
</b>          Will it be alright? The world, I mean.
          He puts his arm around her shoulder.

<b>          DAN
</b>          As long as no-one ever finds out that
          Adrian was behind it all, the public will
          think ion is still up there, watching.

          CLOSE ON: A YELLOW HAPPY FACE--suddenly SPLOTCHED with RED--
          printed on A T-SHIRT now stained with ketchup.
          WE PULL BACK: And find Seymour wears the shirt, eating a
          burger when the Editor bursts in.

<b>          EDITOR

<b>          EDITOR
</b>          Crank file? Whatever! Take some
          initiative! Run whatever you like--
          Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as the crank
          file, where RORSCHACH'S JOURNAL sits on top. Seymour reaches--

<b>          EDITOR (CONT'D)
</b>          --I leave it entirely in your hands.
          --and picks up Rorschach's Journal . Just as he's about
          to open it, we CUT TO BLACK.
