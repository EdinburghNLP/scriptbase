<b>    EXT.   BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA.   DAY
</b><b>1                                                                 1
</b>    SUBTITLE Berkeley, California -1981-

<b>    DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981
</b>
    A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange,
    self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes
    its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK
    O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.
    The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the
    gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned
    around his head.

<b>                          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
</b>               Mark O'Brien has been going to UC
               Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien
               in the motorized gurney heading for
               class last week.

    The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.
    Passers-by just go about their normal business.

<b>                         NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
</b>               He had polio when he was 6 years
               old. The disease left his body
               crippled but his mind remained
               sharp and alert, and since he
               wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien
               entered Cal to major in English and
               learn his trade.

    We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark
    in his contraption.

<b>                          MARK (V.O.)
</b>               Graduation
               Today I hear the crowd's applause
               Receive congratulations from my
               friends
               Today I ask if I've found a place
               among the rest
               I hope you see a man upon this
               stage
               Who studied...read..wrote, and
               passed the test
               In cap and gown, diploma on my
               chair

    THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A
    graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in
    the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,
    rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the
    stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.
<b>                 1A.
</b>
<b>          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
</b>And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from
Cal, one of 250 English majors to
receive degrees today.
<b>                                            2.
</b>

     The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a
     diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the
     rest of the stage to thunderous applause.

     THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news
     reporter talks to camera.

<b>                           NEWS REPORTER
</b>                If this report tells us anything,
                it is that a disability is not
                necessarily a handicap.

     In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered
     round him in a jubilant mood.

<b>                           NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D)
</b>                Mark O'Brien teaches us that
                courage and perseverance overcome
                obstacles.

     Classic shot of the illuminated Golden Gate Bridge.

</b>     It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking
     alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment.
     It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in
     through a partially-opened window.

<b>     INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT
</b><b>3                                                                     3
</b>     The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and
     quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has
     been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we
     become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's
     pump, coming from somewhere close-by.

     In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop
     from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one
     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep
     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the
     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest
     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.
<b>                                   2A.
</b>

<b>                     MARK (V.O.)
</b>          Breathing
          Look you
          This most excellent canopy, the
          air,
          Presses down upon me
          At 15 pounds per square inch
          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.
          Teasing me with its nearness and
          immensity.
          And all I get is a thin stream of
          it.
          A finger's width of the rope that
          ties me to life.

Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then
wanders over to the iron lung.
<b>                                        3.
</b>

    It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head
    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the
    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its
    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of
    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.
    He opens his eyes and grimaces.

<b>                           MARK
</b>              Shit!

    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the
    terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops
    suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.

<b>                        MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              Okay, just focus. Now, scratch
              with your mind, okay, your mind,
              scratch with your mind...

    After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems
    to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the
    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the
    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints
    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They
    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging
    on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.

<b>                        MARK (CONT'D)
</b>              Good morning.

    Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.

<b>    EXT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY
</b><b>4                                                                 4
</b>    JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to
    Mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets
    herself in.

<b>    INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY
</b><b>5                                                                 5
</b>    She comes in.

<b>                        JOAN
</b>              Good morning.

    Mark does not immediately acknowledge her.

<b>                        MARK
</b>              You're late.

<b>    A LITTLE LATER
</b>
    The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has
    been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
    bed bath. He is frail and helpless.
<b>                                        4.
</b>

    There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
    unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least
    temporarily.

<b>                        MARK (V.O.)
</b>              Joan
              I swear this was one crazy bitch
              Who'd swing me about enough to
              scare me,
              But careful enough so she could
              say:
              "Now what was all the yelling
              about? You polios are screamers.
              Always were."
              I didn't say a word, but typed my
              skinny novel in my head,
              And thought about revenge.

    In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an
    involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He
    feels belittled and humiliated.
<b>    A LITTLE LATER
</b>
    Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning
    up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it
    in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.

<b>    EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.     DAY
</b><b>6                                                                 6
</b>    Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
    different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
    and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
    just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
    colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
    of his iron lung.

<b>                        JOAN
</b>              Would you mind if I asked you a
              favor?

<b>                        MARK
</b>              You need help moving furniture?

    She has no apparent sense of humor.

<b>                        JOAN
</b>              I need an advance on my pay, like
              two weeks. That's not a big ask, is
              it?

     satisfaction. There are not many others there.

<b>                           FATHER BRENDAN
</b>                The Apostle Luke tells us that when
                Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby
                in her womb leapt - "For lo, as
                soon as the voice of thy salutation
                sounded in mine ears, the babe
                leaped in my womb for joy". So
                Mary's fear and apprehension slowly
                gave way to pride and purpose.
                Elizabeth saw the greatness in
                Mary. "Blessed art thou among
                women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself
                with St. John, felt the power of
                this wondrous woman. It was
                Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,
                that gave Mary the courage she was
                lacking, and she gave thanks
                saying: "My soul doth magnify the
                Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced
                in God my Saviour".

                May the spirit of the Lord be
                amongst you and remain with you
                always.


     Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his
     head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background we
     can also hear Father Brendan.

     Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the
     church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of
     his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive
     stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that
     of a true believer.

<b>                         MARK (V.O.)
</b>               I'm definitely a true believer. But
               I believe in a God with a sense of
               humor. A wicked sense of humor. One
               who created me in His own image.

     Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when
     he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake
     hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.

<b>                         FATHER BRENDAN

          sorry that he's not here any more.

<b>                     FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          As are many others. I'm going to do

Father Brendan is not sure how to take this.

<b>                       FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Thank you.

<b>                     MARK

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          No, I do not. I believe sincerity
          is the most essential part.

<b>                    MARK

          half an hour. Is that okay?

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Yes, take your time. I'm in no
          rush.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Did Father Seamus say anything to
          you about me?
<b>                       FATHER BRENDAN

</b>          Look, this is not exactly a
          confession. I haven't yet done the
          deed. I was hoping to sort of get a
          quote in advance.

Father Brendan sits down.

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Tell me what's on your mind.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          The most immediate thing on my mind
          would be my attendant, Joan. I'm
          thinking of getting rid of her.
          It's an evil thought, but I can't
          help it.

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Is she dishonest, or incompetent?

<b>                     MARK
</b>          No, neither of those. She looks at
          me the wrong way. It's that you-
          need-me-more-than-I-need-you look.
          I'd like to show her she's wrong,
          just for the evil satisfaction it
          will give me. Is that a sin,
          Father?

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Well, it obviously troubles you.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because
          maybe it's really a power trip. Me
          against her. Me against the world.

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          I really wouldn't worry too much
          about that. The question is whether
          you like having her around.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          I can't stand her.

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Then get rid of her. If I were in a
          position to choose, I'd get someone
          nice. Even it was a power trip.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Then I have your blessing to fire
          her?

</b>               Well, in case she didn't get it the
               first time, I told her again that I
               was in love with her, and wanted to
               marry her, thinking it might swing
               things.

     They sit in silence for a while. Father Brendan seems to be
     at something of a loss.

<b>                          FATHER BRENDAN
</b>               I wish I knew what to say. I mean,
               welcome to the human race. Every
               day someone breaks someone else's
               heart. And as I said, I'm here for
               you. I just wish I had something
               more useful to offer. All I have
               are these vague ideas about life
               and death that priests are equipped
               with. Have you ever thought of
               discussing your feelings with a

               a hug.

     After a moment of surprise, Father Brendan rises to the
     occasion. He seems to know how to move Mark gently and
     efficiently. They hug.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Well, you better believe it.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          So, what sort of chance do you give
          me?

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Of achieving your romantic fantasy?
          Very small to minute.

<b>                     MARK
</b>          Look, there's no need to pull any
          punches. You can be as direct as
          you like with me.

She smiles.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Mark, I'm just a humble sex
          therapist. I try to help people
          with sex problems that can be
          addressed. Your problem, I
          understand, is that you have never
          had sex.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          That's correct.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Would I be correct in assuming
          you're unable to masturbate?

<b>                     MARK
</b>          Correct.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Has anyone done it for you?

<b>                     MARK
</b>          No.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          Have you ever asked anyone?
<b>                                 20.
</b>
<b>                          MARK
</b>                Not specifically. I asked someone
                to marry me. She declined. Does
                that come close to masturbation?

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                You know, being with the person you
                love is not the only way of
                expressing yourself sexually. There
                are people called sex surrogates.

<b>                          MARK
</b>                Oh?

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                Psychotherapists and psychiatrists
                are not allowed to have sex with
                their clients, even if it seems
                like a good idea. Sex surrogates
                don't have that limitation.

<b>                          MARK
</b>                Would this be covered by my medical
                benefits?

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                Unfortunately, no. You'd have to
                pay the full fee, whatever that
                was.

<b>                          MARK
</b>                So, basically, I would be paying
                for sex.

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                Yes Mark, you would be paying for
                sex. But the person you would be
                paying is not a hooker. She is a
                highly trained and sensitive
                professional, who is not motivated
                by money. Just as I'm not. In fact,
                you can think of a surrogate as an
                extension of me. Do I seem like a
                hooker to you?

      Mark thinks.

<b>                           MARK
</b>                Say, one, just to try it and see if

</b>                I'm sorry, it doesn't work that

                patient with yourself. There can be
                quite a lot of talking involved.

<b>                          MARK
</b>                I've set aside $500. Do you think

</b>               Well, one way or another, it's a
               long story, I ended up seeing a
               therapist, a particular sort of
               therapist, a sex therapist.

<b>                    FATHER BRENDAN
</b>          Don't worry about it. Go on.

Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece,
then goes on.

<b>                     MARK
</b>          This therapist suggested I could
          work with a sexual specialist, have
          sex with someone known as a sex
          surrogate, who would be sensitive
          to my special needs. I've been
          giving it some thought.

Father Brendan interrupts him.

<b>                    MARK

Father Brendan shakes his head with concern.

to speak?

as much as I do the therapist's.

<b>                         CHERYL
</b>               I haven't heard from you in a
               while. How are you?

<b>                         LAURA (V.O.)
</b>               Pretty well. Look, I called to ask
               how you would feel about working
               with a severely disabled client.

     Suddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the
     refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice
     bottle.

<b>                         CHERYL
</b>               Hold on a moment, please.

     She covers the mouthpiece of the phone.

<b>                         CHERYL (CONT'D)
</b>               Hey, cut that out!

     He takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves towards
     him. He closes the fridge door and runs.

</b>     Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered
     with soap suds. Rod is washing his back. The phone rings.

<b>                         MARK

<b>                            ROD
</b>               Sure.

     Rod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to
     answer the phone.

<b>                         ROD (CONT'D)
</b>               Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.

     He switches it to speaker so Mark can hear.

<b>                         CHERYL (V.O.)

<b>                                        29.

     Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face
     looks drained of blood.

<b>                          ROD
</b>                Just one moment, please.

     Rod switches the phone off speaker.

<b>                          ROD (CONT'D)
</b>                What am I doing here? Yes or no?
                Make up your mind.

     Mark hesitates, then nods weakly. Rod puts the phone back on
     speaker.

<b>                          MARK
</b>                Hullo, this is Mark.

                you'd like to meet. Is that right?

     Mark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound from
     his throat.

<b>                           MARK
</b>                Uh, yes.

<b>                          CHERYL (V.O.)

     Mark is lying on his side, shirtless. His face is even more
     grim than when we last saw it.

The doorbell rings. They stare at the door. Vera finally goes
over and opens it. Silhouetted against the light is Cheryl
with a substantial bag. She could be the Avon lady. She has a
light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.

<b>                    VERA
</b>          No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera,
          I'm one of Mark's helpers.

Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her
face, just a smile.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          Hi, Mark O'Brien.

Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.

Vera is already at the front door.

<b>                    VERA
</b>          I'll be back, say, in two hours?

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          Yes, two hours, that would be
          perfect.

She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned.

<b>                       CHERYL (CONT'D)
</b>          So...

Mark blurts out.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Your money's on the dresser.

Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned,
Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an
envelope.

<b>                       CHERYL
</b>          Thank you.

She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          That was the wrong way to start
          off.
<b>                                     33.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          Yes, it was. Shall we start again?

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Please, you start.

She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very
frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in.

<b>                     CHERYL
</b>          Although the aim is for us to have
          sex, I'm not a prostitute and you
          don't need to pay me up front. I've
          nothing against prostitutes, but
          there's a difference. We can talk
          about that later.

<b>                       MARK
</b>          I'm sorry.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          The other thing is, there is a
          limit to the number of sessions we
          can have together. Did Laura
          mention that when you saw her?

<b>                    MARK
</b>          I'm sorry, I don't remember.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          The limit is six. But that gives us
          plenty of opportunity to explore.
          Now, I understand you are able to
          have an erection.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Yes, but not out of choice.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          Do you know how many men there are
          on this planet who would give
          anything for a natural erection?

She looks around the room.

<b>                    CHERYL (CONT'D)
</b>          Is this your place?

<b>                    MARK
</b>          No, it's a friend's. The only
          bedroom furniture I have at my
          place is an iron lung. I've
          sometimes thought about buying a
          futon, in case the need arose.

<b>                    CHERYL

          expensive though, a nice futon. I
          mean, how much do you think a good
          one would cost?

<b>                    CHERYL

          let go.

Cheryl lies down beside him.

<b>                    CHERYL (CONT'D)

          What's it like to be a poet?

<b>                    MARK

<b>                       MARK
</b>          It keeps me breathing. I can spend
          a few hours outside of it, with my
          portable respirator, depending on
          how I feel. But I work and sleep in
          the iron lung.

          usual.

<b>                    CHERYL
</b>          That's great. Do you have any areas
          of unusual sensitivity? Any parts
          of your body you don't want me to
          touch?

<b>                    MARK
</b>          I have normal sensitivity all over.
          It's just that my muscles don't
          work. You can touch me anywhere.

<b>                    CHERYL

Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He
hesitates momentarily.

<b>                    MARK
</b>          Sure.

Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible
in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She
starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt-
sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.

<b>                    MARK (CONT'D)
</b>          Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!

She recoils, shocked.

She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the
fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.

Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his
way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally
sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.

his ear.

                Catholic. He was extremely nervous.
                He yelled a lot when I took off his
                shirt, but I think more out of fear
                than pain. He cannot masturbate.
                Has only had the occasional kissing
                experience. He is capable of
                achieving an erection easily, but
                the unusual curvature of his body
                could be a serious obstacle to

Cheryl locates the mouth-piece to his oxygen supply and puts
it between his lips. After a few breaths he is relatively
relaxed. She lies down beside him.

Mark finally lets go of the mouth-piece. He looks melancholy.
She does not fail to notice.

Mark smiles. He seems to be lost in some memory.

He looks at Cheryl.

</b>          That was what my father used to
          sing to my little sister, Karin.
          That was before she died. She was
          kind of a sad little girl. It
          didn't do much good. I'm really
          sorry that the last time I saw her,

Mark's eyes begin to look teary.

<b>                     MARK (CONT'D)
</b>          My parents could have left me in

Cheryl props herself up on one elbow.

     images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the background,
     the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums,
     dancing, trances. Then Ravel's "Bolero". Clint Eastwood

          they threw me out, but I threw them

          me. Our son is neutral on the
          subject, but theoretically, if it
          looks like it makes me happy, it'll
          make him happy too. That's the way
          my husband's family talks, and
          thinks. The fact that I'm happy
          already, doesn't seem to be

      The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a
      Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast
      stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says
      12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the
      window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung
      whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an
      eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.

      For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his
      head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over

      She takes it and opens it uncertainly, somehow anticipating
      its contents.

</b>      A full-blown Catholic funeral is happening. Meaningful hugs
      are exchanged. Eyes are dabbed. We hear Mark's voice.

<b>                           MARK (V.O.)
</b>                 Three Reasons to Live

                 The mundane:
                 O God, it was boring, but I did it
                 got it out of the way

                 The transcendent:
                 We had this agreement --
                 God gave me life for a while
                 I gave Him gratitude for a while
                 and it worked out OK

                 The curious:
                 You know how every day is
                 different?
                 I just wanted to see
                 what would happen next

</b>      Father Brendan delivers a eulogy. We see members of Mark's
      FAMILY, all teary-eyed.

<b>                           FATHER BRENDAN (TO MARK)
</b>                 Mark, I know you're watching. I'm
                 sorry, my friend, but we have to do
                 this. Just bear with me, and I
                 think you might like it.

<b>                             FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
</b><b>                             (CONT'D)
</b>                 I've been branching out lately,
                 reading Native American stories
                 about the character of the
                 trickster. Sometimes he shows up
                 as a coyote, sometimes as a raven,
                 but he always does the unexpected.
                 The trickster breaks the rules.
                 Mark O'Brien, whose life we're
                 celebrating today, was very much
                 the trickster -- anyone who knew
                 him knew that.

<b>          FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)
</b>Besides his irreverent humor and
alarming honesty, he always did the
unexpected.

In nearly every aspect of his life,
Mark did the unexpected. His was a
dynamic voice in a paralyzed body,
a full life lived long after he
should have been dead. He
graduated from college, wrote and
published articles and poems, and --
against all odds, by his own
admission -- entered into the fully
human experience of physical love.

In this way, Mark lived from day to
day to day, from breath to breath
to breath, for 49 years. He loved,
and he was loved and in his quiet
voice, he spoke loud truths.

      We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows.
      Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next
      to a tall, boring-looking HUSBAND.

</b>                Susan Fernbach will now read one of
                Mark's favorite poems.

<b>                          SUSAN (V.O.)
</b>                This is called Love Poem for No One
                in Particular.

      We see SUSAN at the lectern, reading from a book.

<b>                           SUSAN
</b>                Let me touch you with my words.
                For my hands lie limp as empty
                gloves.
                Let my words stroke your hair,
                Slide down your back and tickle
                your belly.
                For my hands, light and free-flying
                as bricks,
                Ignore my wishes and stubbornly
                refuse to carry out my quietest
                desires.

      We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the
      first time.

<b>                          SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>                Let my words enter your mind,
                bearing torches.
                Admit them willingly into your
                being
                So they may caress you gently
                within.

</b>      In the middle of the room, moonlit, is Mark's iron lung,
      empty and majestic, with the cat sitting on top. As we move
      around the eerie capsule, we hear the sound of the French Can-
      Can slowly fade up. It continues over END CREDITS.
