          INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN

          A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on
          an empty stretch of interstate.
          This is HENRY.
          He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light
          out. There's snow on the ground.
          He's neither asleep nor awake.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

          HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee
          into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.

                         A CAR
          Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window.
          But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE...
          Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He
          downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the
          horizon again.
          It's cloudy out there.

                         A CLOCK
          flips to 6:00.

                         

          INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER

          Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps
          out into the icy morning.
          He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to
          build.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,
          abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

          The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest
          salt-box houses.

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.

           2.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks.
          It's clean and ordinary in here.
          His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a
          NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set
          for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a
          little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.

                          HENRY
           Smells good.

                          DEBBIE
           Sit down.
          He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.

                          HENRY
           Wow. Thanks.
          He digs in.

                          DEBBIE
           How was your night?

                          HENRY
           Good. How was yours?
          She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.

                          DEBBIE
           Good.
          She sets it down.

                          HENRY
           This is great.
          She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Your shift's at eight thirty?
          She nods.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           You not eating?

                          DEBBIE
           I already did.
          He takes another bite.

                          HENRY
           You okay?

           3.

                         

                         
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Are you coming with me to Cindy and
           Bill's on Saturday?

                          HENRY
           Sure. What time?
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           For the baby shower.

                          HENRY
           Right.
          She just stares at him...

                          DEBBIE
           Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and
           Bill's.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          DEBBIE
           I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come
           here.

                          HENRY
           Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?
          Henry stops eating.

                          HENRY
           You're talking about kids.

                          DEBBIE
           Of course I am.

                          HENRY
           Okay.

                          DEBBIE
           'Okay' you want kids?
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I love kids.
          He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.

           4.

                         

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Henry?
          He looks up again.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Do you still love me?
          He's still as a stone.

                          HENRY
           Of course I do.
          She looks at him.

                          DEBBIE
           Because I know you did once.
          A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.
          She's crestfallen.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           What happened, Henry?
          He just sits.

          THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
          Henry gets up, heads to the door.
          Debbie watches him go...

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL
          UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
          GUYS sit in the back of the car.
          Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
          VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
          friend is JOE.

                          EDDIE
           Henry Torne.

                          HENRY
           Eddie Vibes.

                          EDDIE
           So how you doin', man?

                          HENRY
           I'm okay. What's going on?

                          EDDIE
           Listen, I got a man down here.

           5.

                         

                         
          Eddie glances up and down the street.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Mind if we come in for a second?

                         

          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick
          JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform.
          She touches his forehead.

                          DEBBIE
           He's hot.
          He starts to retch.

                          JOE
           (holding it in)
           I'm sorry.

                          DEBBIE
           You better come with me.
          Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly
          toward the bathroom.

                          EDDIE
           Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          EDDIE
           So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got
           league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's
           our first baseman. And he's not exactly
           game-ready as you can see...

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          Eddie stares at him. Smiles.

                          EDDIE
           So, what do you say?

                          HENRY
           What do I say what?

                          EDDIE
           You feel like playing a little ball?
           Filling in for Joe?

                          HENRY
           It's November.

           6.

                         

                         

                          EDDIE
           Yeah. They keep the field in perfect
           shape.

                          HENRY
           Oh.
          Beat.

                          EDDIE
           So what do you say?
          Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches
          Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.
          She's tending to him, caring for him...
          Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Henry?

                         

          INT. IMPALA - LATER

          Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.
          Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They
          grimly stare out the windows.

                          EDDIE
           Appreciate you driving, man.

                          HENRY
           So where's this game?

                          EDDIE
           Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. MAIN ST - DAY

          The car turns a corner on to Main Street.

                          EDDIE
           Pull up right over here. We gotta grab
           some beer money at that ATM.
          The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST

          BUFFALO BANK.
          Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
          Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

           7.

                         

                         
          After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
          his sleeve.

                         BEHIND HIM
          In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
          guys slipping on SKI MASKS...

                         HENRY'S POV
          A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
          store and enters. He says good morning to all the
          animals. It's a strange one man show.

          LOUD ALARMS BLARE --
          Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming

                         FROM :

          THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS
          Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
          directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
          GUARD chases them.
          ON HENRY, confused.
          A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
          crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
          sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :

           FRANK (O.S.)
           You!
          Henry turns forward again.

                         A GUN
          Is pointing at him through the windshield.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Freeze!
          Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
          Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
          distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
          Holding on Henry's stunned expression...

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we
          never see, paces back and forth.

                          DETECTIVE
           Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.

           8.

                         

                         
          Henry just listens.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           All you have to do is give me those
           names. And you can go home. It's that
           simple.
          Henry's still silent.

                          DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
           Come on. Why are you sticking up for
           these people? They're not your friends.
           You've got a wife. You've got a job...
           don't you care?

                          (THEN)
           All you have to do is say something.
          Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first
          time.

           JUDGE (V.O.)
           ...in light of the fact that this is a
           first offence...

                         

          INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY

          Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed
          ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery.
          A JUDGE stares at Henry.

                          JUDGE
           ...the court sentences Henry Torne to
           four years in prison for the crime of
           Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.

          WHACK!
          The gavel goes down.
          Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with
          the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.
          Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...

          CLANK!
          A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...

                         

          INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

          Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard
          locks the door in front of him.

           MAX (O.S.)
           So. What're you in for?

           9.

                         

                         
          Henry turns.

                          HENRY
           Huh.

                          MAX
           I said what are you in for?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Bank robbery.
          MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.

                          MAX
           Good. Clean. Simple. I like it.
          Henry just watches.

                          HENRY
           But I didn't do it.
          Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.

                          MAX
           Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial
           favorite. Identities are just constructs,
           anyway. They're mistaken all the time.
          He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I'm Max.

                          HENRY
           Henry.

                          MAX
           Go on. Make yourself at home.
          Henry sits down on his bed.

                          HENRY
           So...what are you in for?

                          MAX
           Life.
          A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

           10.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING

          All the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max
          is already dressed.

                          MAX
           Hurry up. We gotta go.
          Henry's disoriented.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Breakfast.
          A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton
          against the bars of the cell.

                         

          INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

          Max and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for
          their food.

                          MAX
           `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.'
          Henry's lost in thought...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           What are you thinking about?

                          HENRY
           Nothing.

                          MAX
           You're thinking something. Let me guess.
           You're thinking, `How did I get here?'
          Henry puts out his tray.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           How do you think any of us got here?

                          HENRY
           I'm not sure.

                          MAX
           I'll tell you how. Because we committed
           crimes. But we committed to the wrong
           thing. You see that was our mistake. We
           didn't fulfill our potential, we got
           angry and we took it out on other people.
          A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           See him?

           11.

                         

                         
          Henry nods.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He
           could've been, but he chose not to fulfil
           his potential, he chose not to commit to
           his dream. And now look at him.

                          (THEN)
           Bad choices, see.
          Henry does.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           By the way, I recommend the potatoes.

                         

          INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Max and Henry sit down at one of the long tables.

                          MAX
           That's the real crime, Henry. Not
           committing to your dream.
          They begin to eat.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           So what's yours?

                          HENRY
           My what?

                          MAX
           Your dream.

                          HENRY
           Not sure I ever had one.

                          MAX
           Never had a dream? What kind of a life is
           that?

                          HENRY
           I don't know. A pretty good one?

                          MAX
           Henry, you're in jail.
          Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.

                         

          EXT. YARD - DAY

          Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.

                          MAX
           But here's the good news. We got all this
           time to do. And time is a medium of
           exchange. You can buy things with it.

                          (MORE)

           12.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And
           in your case, you can figure out what
           your dream is.
          Max takes his arm :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Your dream is your truth is your destiny.
          Henry looks at him.

                          HENRY
           I told you. I'm here by mistake.
          Max shoots a look back at him.

                          MAX
           There are no mistakes.
          Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.

                          HENRY
           What?
          Several convicts are making their way towards them...
          He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :

                          MAX
           But you're going to have to fight for
           that dream, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I am.

                          MAX
           You're at a crossroads now. There are
           going to be tests!

                          HENRY
           What tests?

          CRAACK!
          Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab
          him, throw him to the ground next to Max.

                          MAX
           This is your moment. Whatever you do now
           defines you. Go get em!
          Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging,
          taking several down. He gives it everything he's got.
          They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps
          fighting...but it's hopeless.
          GUARDS rush in. Max watches.

           13.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHT

          Henry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised.

                          MAX
           You did good, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I don't feel good.

                          MAX
           You're doing better than you feel.
          Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Go to sleep, Henry.

                          (BEAT)
           Sleep is for the blessed.

                         

          INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT

          One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast
          string of cells.

                          FADE OUT :

                         

          INT. VISITING AREA - DAY

          Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting
          tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort.
          A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some
          time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          HENRY
           Hi. You look beautiful.

                          DEBBIE
           Thank you. How are you doing?

                          HENRY
           I'm okay. How about you?

                          DEBBIE
           I'm good.
          A beat.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Listen, Henry. I have something I need to
           talk to you about.

           14.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Okay.

                          DEBBIE
           I fell in love.
          Henry takes that in.

                          HENRY
           Oh.
          Pause.

                          DEBBIE
           I just...I mean it just happened.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           Okay. Wow...

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry, Henry.

                          HENRY
           It's alright.

                          DEBBIE
           You're not mad?
          He thinks.

                          HENRY
           No.
          He looks at her.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I want you to be happy.

                          DEBBIE
           You too, Henry.
          No one moves.

                         

          EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY

          Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just
          happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty.
          Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a
          hand around his shoulder.

                          MAX
           I ever tell you I was married?
          Henry turns to him.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I mean nearly. I had a lovely
           correspondence going with Jocelyn
           Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she
           finally came on visitor's day she said I
           was too short.
          Henry thinks.

                          HENRY
           Books and covers.

                          MAX
           Right. Books and covers.

                          CUT TO:

          TWO YEARS LATER

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY

          There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry
          sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard.
          Their cell has temporarily been converted into a
          makeshift BARBERSHOP.
          CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by
          Max the Barber.
          Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.

                          MAX
           Clean as a whistle.

                          FINK
           (checking himself out)
           Max, I think you missed your calling.

                          MAX
           Thank you.

                          (THEN)
           Who do we got next, Henry?
          Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.

                          HENRY
           Hector. You're up.
          Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift
          barbershop carefully.
          Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.

                          HECTOR
           Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?

           16.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           October.

                          HECTOR
           Show us what you did for the board last
           time.

                          MAX
           I'm working.
          The other INMATES egg him on.

                          OTHER INMATES
           Show us!

                          MAX
           Leave me alone.

                          INMATES
           Come on! Show us.
          Max finally puts his clippers down.

                          MAX
           All right, so I'm sitting there, and the
           head of the board asks me what I'm going
           to do if they let me out this time. And,
           so...
          Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back
          a little bit...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I get this twitch! and then I give him my
           answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set
           your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on
           a naked rampage through your garden, dance
           in the streets of your l'il hometown like a
           crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming
           through the ethereal sky like God's blackest
           angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly
           fireball!
          Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a
          mad man...

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't
           want THIS. Not out THERE.
          The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up
          his clippers and smiles :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Believe me, I'm not going anywhere.
          They crack up. A beat.

           17.

                         

                         

                          HECTOR
           Hey, White Shadow. When's your review
           coming up?

                          HENRY
           Next month.

                          HECTOR
           You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?

                          HENRY
           Nope.

                          HECTOR
           What, you don't like it around here?

                          MAX
           Everyone knows Henry's innocent.
          Laughter.

                          HECTOR

                          (TO HENRY)
           The board don't like it when you deny the
           crime.

                          HENRY
           I didn't do the crime.

                          HECTOR
           Hey, but you got the time...so you may as
           well have done it.
          Everyone laughs.

                          MAX
           I like it! `You got the time, so you may
           as well have done the crime!'
          Everyone laughs again.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Now that's funny, Henry.

                          HENRY
           Yeah, you're right.
          Henry ponders.

                         

          INT. SHOWERS - DAY

          INMATES shower. Alot of noise and steam. Henry and Max at
          the end of a row.

                          HENRY
           You know you never did tell me what your
           dream was, Max.

           18.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           I'm living it.

                          HENRY
           Really?

                          MAX
           Sure! It's easier to live in here. You
           don't have to do anything. You just show
           up. In fact they even do that for you.
           I'm living the life.

                          HENRY
           This place is horrible, Max.
          Max thinks, lathering his hair...

                          MAX
           So why didn't you just say something?

                          HENRY
           When?

                          MAX
           Back then. When you had the chance. When
           you were still innocent.

                          HENRY
           I thought maybe this was my way out.

                          MAX
           And was it?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          MAX
           See. There are no mistakes.

                         

          INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNING

          It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in
          street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a
          sports bag, zips it up.
          Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks
          vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to
          his neck.

                          MAX
           You got everything, kid?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          Henry, silent for a moment.

           19.

                         

                         

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Maybe you should think about getting out
           of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of
           coffee on the outside.

                          MAX
           The only thing I've ever missed in twenty
           three years is a hot bath. And that ain't
           worth walking out of here for.
          The cell door slides open.

           PRISON GUARD (O.S.)
           Torne! Let's go!
          Henry starts to leave.

                          MAX
           Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is
           your truth.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I thought it was my dream is my truth is
           my destiny.

                          MAX
           Just testing.
          Henry continues...stops at the door.

                          HENRY
           I'm going to miss you.

                          MAX
           Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           I'm still gonna miss you.

                          MAX
           Get out of here, Henry.

                         

          EXT. PRISON - DAY

          It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the
          prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's
          cold. We see his exhale.
          He starts to walk.

           20.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

          Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York
          countryside streaking past him in a blur...

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          Henry turns onto his old street.

                         

          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before
          ringing the bell. A beat.
          The door opens. It's --

                         JOE
          The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a
          suit and tie now.

                          JOE
           Henry. How you doing?

                          HENRY
           Hey.

                          JOE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Debbie! Henry's here.

                          (TO HENRY)
           Come on in. Make yourself at home.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Henry enters. His old house looks more or less the same.
          Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in
          the living room.

                          JOE
           Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up
           for my meeting. You want a beer?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                          JOE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer?

           21.

                         

                         
          As Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they
          look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with
          a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          HENRY
           Hi.
          It's not so awkward.

                         

          INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

          Debbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's
          name on it.

                          DEBBIE
           I think that's everything you wanted.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          A beat. They just stand there for a moment.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Are you happy?

                          DEBBIE
           I am, Henry.

                          HENRY
           I'm glad.
          He means it.
          Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.

                          DEBBIE
           So what are you going to do now?

                          HENRY
           I don't know yet.
          Joe enters.

                          JOE
           Honey, they're starting to arrive.
          Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO HENRY)
           We're having a meeting. It's his new
           business.

           22.

                         

                         

                          JOE
           Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry.
           You could become a distributor for Jin
           Chi.
          They all head out of the garage.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           It's Korean kitchenware. The future of
           food storage. Plus, if you recruit
           distributors, you get paid even more.
          Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice
          Henry walking out carrying his box.

                          HENRY
           You mean like a pyramid scheme?

                          JOE
           No! God, no. It's a multi-layered
           marketing paradigm.

                          (HENRY'S LOOK)
           Anyway, why don't you give it some
           thought?
          Henry nods, starts to head out.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Henry.

                          HENRY
           Yeah?

                          JOE
           Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For
           not giving up my name.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I don't know your name.

                          JOE
           Sure you do. It's Joe.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Right. You're welcome Joe.

                          (TO DEB)
           I'll see you Deb.

                          DEBBIE
           Take care of yourself, Henry.
          He leaves.

           23.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. STREET NEAR HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry walks down the street with his box.
          A NEIGHBOR approaches, recognizes him.

                          NEIGHBOR
           Henry! How are you?
          Henry looks over.

                          HENRY
           I'm good. How are you?

                          NEIGHBOR
           Great. How was Greece?

                          HENRY
           Greece?

                          NEIGHBOR
           Debbie told us all about your trip.
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I was in prison.

                          NEIGHBOR
           In Greece?

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          A shitty apartment. Tiny. A bed. A desk.
          The TV is on low.
          Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his
          legs, its contents spread out over the bed.
          Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico
          with Debbie. A Baseball glove.
          A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.
          He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of
          adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST

                         GUY"
          He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover,
          graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates
          including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"
          Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a
          pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's
          childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He
          finishes putting everything back.

           24.

                         

                         
          A distinctive JINGLE! on the TV. Henry looks over.
          An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a PRETTY YOUNG
          BLONDE in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera.

                          PRETTY BLOND

                          (ON TV)
           Take a chance on life, take a chance on
           Buffalotto!
          Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it.

                         

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE, BUFFALO - DAY

          Henry sits at a desk. He's handed a cup of coffee by his
          FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER -- whose face we never actually
          see.

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           (re: the coffee)
           Is it okay?
          Henry takes a sip.

                          HENRY
           Good. Thank you.

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           So what do you think?

                          HENRY
           About what?

           PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)
           About building your life from the ground up.

                          HENRY
           Sure. Sounds good.

                         

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          A grass field. It's raining.
          Henry steps into frame with a SHOVEL. Behind him an OLDER
          MAN in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow.

          IN THE DITCH - LATER
          From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs. He's a few feet
          down. The wheelbarrowman still watches silently.

           25.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His
          mind turns. He's starting to think...O.S. the sound of
          the `BuffaLotto' jingle on the TV.

                         

          EXT. DITCH - DAY

          It's snowing. The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as
          Henry digs another small ditch.

                         

          INT. BUFFALO SIX MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

          Henry sits in the back row. We watch him as he eats
          popcorn. The movie flashes across his face. There are
          guns involved...

                         

          EXT. FIELD - DUSK

          A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch.
          Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's
          hand.
          He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower
          poking through the dirt.

                         

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

          The female PAROLE OFFICER sets down a cup of coffee.
          Henry drinks. We still don't see her face.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          She sits down at her desk.

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Seems like yesterday you walked through
           that door.

                          HENRY
           It does?

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           Henry, You've done your time. You are now
           a free free man.

                          (THEN)
           How does it feel?
          Henry takes a breath.

                          HENRY
           Good.

           26.

                         

                         
          She signs a document and hands it to him.

           FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
           So, What's next?
          Henry doesn't answer.
          The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION,
          staring, as we

                          CUT TO :

                         

                         
          HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with
          purpose...
          We follow them.
          After a while, the boots stop.

                         

          EXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY

          HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :

          THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK
          Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he
          contemplates the place...
          Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.
          There's something happening, he's not sure what it
          is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each
          passing moment becomes more like a knowing....
          A moment of revelation.
          He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,
          heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the
          SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --

          SCREEEECH!
          A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down.
          A GIRL (30s)
          Rushes out of the car.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing? What the fuck are you
           doing? Are you okay?
           (into cell phone)
           Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran
           someone over. No, he looks okay.

           27.

                         

                         
          She hangs up.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You idiot, you weren't even looking where
           you were going! Are you okay?
          Henry's a little delirious.

                          HENRY
           I think I'm okay.
          He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.

                          JULIE
           No. Stay on the ground.
          The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.

                          FRANK
           Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an
           ambulance.

                          HENRY
           No, don't.
           (Starts to stand)
           I think I'm okay.

                          FRANK

                          (RECOGNIZING HIM)
           You!

                          HENRY

                          (RECOGNIZING HIM)
           Yeah. Me.

                          JULIE
           (to Frank, confused)
           Is he alright?

                          FRANK
           Are you alright?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Fine.

                          JULIE
           He just walked right out into the street.
           He came out of nowhere.

                          FRANK
           I saw the whole thing. You were on the
           phone. You weren't even paying attention.

                          JULIE
           Yes. I was. I know how to drive.
          Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the
          sidewalk.

           28.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What are you doing? Get back on the
           ground!

                          FRANK
           Park your car. I'm going to take him into
           that cafe.
          She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side.
          Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           They let you out, huh.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          FRANK
           Let's get you a seat in here.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          Frank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by
          the door.

                          FRANK
           Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.
          Julie comes in.

                          JULIE
           Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an
           ambulance.

                          HENRY
           It's okay. I really am fine.

                          FRANK
           Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got
           run over.
           (sucks his teeth)
           Lucky I guess.
          Frank leaves.

                          JULIE
           I think we should call a doctor.
          Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What? Are you okay?
          He keeps staring...

           29.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a
           doctor?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           No. You look familiar.

                          JULIE
           What?
          It takes Julie a moment.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Oh. That.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          JULIE

                          (SINGS)
           'Take a chance on life, take a chance on
           Buffa-lotto'?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           Oh, that's why.
          An awkward moment.

                          JULIE
           Well, I guess you seem to be okay.

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I'm okay.

                          JULIE
           Okay. So you're okay?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Great.

                          (THEN)
           So I can go now?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                          JULIE
           Bye.

                          (THEN)
           And be more careful.

                          HENRY
           Thanks.

           30.

                         

                         
          She leaves. He watches her go.

                          WAITRESS
           Anything else I can get you?

                          HENRY
           A bathroom?

                         HENRY
          Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the
          wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.

                         

          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry peeing. His eyes drift to the photos on the wall to
          his right.
          He zeroes in on a prohibition-era newspaper framed FRONT

          PAGE.
          A photo of COPS IN TRENCH COATS posing in front of THE

          FIRST BUFFALO BANK WITH CRATES OF SEIZED BOOZE.

          `WHISKY IN THE VAULT!'

          ON HENRY'S FACE
          The sound of Henry's Pee STOPS.
          He takes a step closer to the next urinal over. Reads the
          rest of it...
          A COP IN A TUNNEL, smiling as he points up to a HOLE :

                         `TUNNEL DISCOVERED'
          After a moment Henry starts peeing again. Thinking about
          what he's just read...

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM CAFE - DAY

          Henry comes out. Stares at the bank across the street.
          Looks both ways and then crosses the road.

                         

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

          Henry stands in the back alley behind the bank, feeling
          the place out...his head turns between the back door of
          the bank and the back of the building opposite...then
          looks down at his feet.
          He looks up again, notices the :

                         `BACKSTAGE DOOR'

           31.

                         

                         
          He goes over to it. It's locked.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAWN

          Henry's still in his clothes, lying on his bed, his mind
          reeling, the TV on low....
          He gets out of bed. Puts his foot in his boot.

           PRISON GUARD (V.O.)
           Max! You've got a visitor.

                         

          INT. VISITOR'S AREA - DAY

          Henry sits at a visitor's table, waiting. A moment
          passes, a DOOR CLANKS open and --

                         MAX
          Emerges with a guard.

                          MAX
           I thought I told you I didn't want to see
           your face again.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           Nice to see you too.
          He goes to hug him.

                          GUARD
           No contact.
          They sit. They look at each other a moment.

                          HENRY
           I figured it out.

                          MAX
           What?

                          HENRY
           My destiny.

                          MAX
           Good. What is it?
          A beat. Henry leans in.

                          HENRY
           The bank.

                          MAX
           The bank is your destiny?

           32.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          MAX
           What bank?

                          HENRY
           The one I didn't rob.
          Pause.

                          MAX
           But you went to jail for it.

                          HENRY
           Exactly.

                          MAX
           What are you talking about Henry?
          Henry looks around. Closer --

                          HENRY
           I did the time, I may as well have done
           the crime.

                          MAX
           Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.

                          (THEN)
           I still don't get it.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           I need your help.

                          MAX
           What for?

                          HENRY

                          (A WHISPER)
           To rob the bank.
          Pause.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           So what do you say?

                          MAX
           I'm in Jail. That's what I say.

                          HENRY
           You've got your review coming up --

                          MAX
           -- So?

                          HENRY
           So you can get of here. If you want to.

           33.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           No. It's not as simple as that.

                          HENRY
           Yes, it is.

                          MAX
           No, it's not.

                          HENRY
           Yes. It is.

                          MAX
           No, it's not.

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           I'm happy here. This is my home.

                          HENRY
           This is not a home. This is a prison.

                          MAX
           Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy
           here.
          A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.

                          HENRY
           Max. You can't die in this place.

                          MAX
           I can die wherever I want.

                          HENRY
           You really want to die here?

                          MAX
           What do you want, Henry?

                          HENRY
           I'm asking for your help.

                          MAX
           To rob that bank?!

                          HENRY
           I've thought about it. It's the right thing.

                          (THEN)
           For both of us.
          A long beat. Max gets up :

                          MAX
           Henry. I got cards.

           34.

                         

                         

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           Great to see you, kid.

                          HENRY
           Max!
          Max exits.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          Henry stares at the bank again...then walks down Mecca
          Road glimpses the marquee of `THE ORPHEUM' theatre.
          DAREK MILLODRAGOVIC's `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' by Anton

                         CHEKHOV

                         OPENS NOVEMBER 23
          Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and
          the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming

                         PRODUCTION:
          Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry-
          shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it,
          including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as
          Madame Ranevsky.
          A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk
          of the cherry tree with bloody roots.
          Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre
          door.
          This one's open.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

          Henry enters the lobby. The light is low. There's
          something almost magical about this place.
          Henry hears VOICES drifting in from the main theatre as
          he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds..

           JULIE (O.S.)
           (As Madame Ranevsky)
           Is it really me sitting here? I want to
           dance and clap my hands!

          INT. MAIN THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

          Henry enters the back of the theatre...sees the girl on

                         STAGE :

           35.

                         

                         

                         JULIE
          The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I
           love my country. I love it deeply. I
           couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much.

                          (SHE'S TEARFUL)
           But...I must drink my coffee...thank you
           Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so
           glad to find you still alive.
          Henry's transfixed. She's good. ARNOLD, regional actor
          extraordinaire, plays Lophakin :

           ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN (O.S.)
           Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm
           an upstart. A Money grubber!
           (marching to and fro)
           He can say whatever he likes. I don't
           care a bit.
          He chews up the scenery.

           ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN

                          (CONT'D)
           I just want you to believe in me like the
           old days. I just want your wonderful
           tender eyes to look at me like they did

                          THEN --

                          DAREK
           Stop! Stop!
          DAREK, the CZECH DIRECTOR -- greasy-haired, balding and
          smoking -- stands up in his seat in the stalls.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your
           `safe face' --

                          ARNOLD
           -- But I was --

                          DAREK
           Not you. You're doing the best you can.
           You.
          He points to JULIE.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?

                          JULIE
           I'm...listening.

           36.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           Listening? You look like you're hearing.
           To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be
           strong. To listen is an action.
          Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           What is that?

                          JULIE
           An action. I'm listening. Is this what
           you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?

                          DAREK
           No, Djula.

                          JULIE
           Then what do you want?
          They stare each other down.

                          DAREK
           I want you to be more. I want you to be
           better than that.
          He snatches the cup from her hand.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Now go drink coffee. And don't think
           about what I want, think about what you
           want!

                          JULIE
           Fine. I'll go drink coffee.
          Julie marches off stage...

                          DAREK
           I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go
           drink coffee'.

                          (SHOUTS)
           Ten minutes everyone!
           (to his Eastern European

                          ASSISTANT)
           Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll
           all have coffee Djula! Every single one
           of us! And think about what we want!

                         HENRY
          Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing here?
          She doesn't wait, just walks right past...
          Henry follows.

           37.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Are you here to sue me?

                          HENRY
           No.

                          JULIE
           Then what are you doing here?

                          HENRY
           I saw your picture outside. The door was
           open. I came in.
          She exits.

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - OUTSIDE

          Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the
          traffic. Henry follows.

                          HENRY
           Is it always like that?

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           (gesturing back to the

                          THEATRE)
           That.

                          JULIE
           You mean rehearsal?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           It's a process.

                          HENRY
           Looks complicated.

                          JULIE
           It's all pain.

                          (THEN)
           Chekhov, right?
          They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :

                          HENRY
           I thought you were listening.
          She looks at him, curiously.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm Henry by the way.

           38.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Julie.

                         

          INT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY

          They enter. It's busy.

                          PIERRE
           Madame Julie!

                          JULIE
           Coffee, Pierre.
          She points at Henry.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You want one?

                          HENRY
           Sure.

                         SHE SIGNALS :

                          JULIE
           Two.
          They stand right there at the bar. Silence.
          Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her
          shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her
          photo to the live person.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What?
          She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           So what do you think?

                          HENRY
           Doesn't look like you.

                          JULIE
           No, I meant the poster.

                          HENRY
           Oh. It's funny.

                          JULIE
           Actors on a tree is funny?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.

           39.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           That's the director's joke.
          She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           He's making a comment on the American
           culture. Actors faces as falling fruit.
           Birth, death, the consumption of the ID.
          Henry's interested.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           To him, the American dream has become the
           world's nightmare. "You are the country
           of apocalypse."

                          (THEN )
           That's what he told us on the first day
           of rehearsal, anyway.

                          HENRY
           Oh.

                          JULIE
           The irony is, he loves the American
           dream. I mean that's why he's here,
           right?

                          (WHISPERS)
           But I know for a fact he hates himself
           for loving it. It's always an inside job,
           isn't it?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I guess.
          Pause.

                          JULIE
           But the truth is I wasn't listening. I
           was playing it safe.

                          (THEN)
           He was right. The jerk. About that,
           anyway...
          She drinks her coffee.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's
           last play. He was dying when he wrote it.
          She thinks. He listens.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It's perfect.

                          HENRY
           Why?

           40.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D
           It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.

                          HENRY
           You're leaving?
          She downs the last of her coffee.

                          JULIE
           Right after we're done.

                          (THEN)
           I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not
           suing me. I'll see ya.
          She leaves.
          He watches her through the glass as she walks across the
          street...right past the bank on her way back to the
          theatre.

                         

          INT. PRISON - MORNING

          MAX's cell door opens. He walks, happy and confident this
          morning.

                          INMATE

                          (CALLING OUT)
           Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?

                          MAX
           Right.

                          ANOTHER CONVICT
           Give `em hell!

                          MAX
           I always do, Felipe!
          As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens
          the next steel door for him.

                          GUARD
           Morning, Max. Here we are again.

                          MAX
           How's your grandson?

                          GUARD
           Just started first grade.

                          MAX
           That's great. The socialization begins!
          The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD
          ROOM at the end of another long corridor.
          They stop at the door.

           41.

                         

                         

                          GUARD
           How many more of these you think you got
           in you, Max?
          Pause.

                          MAX
           As many as it takes.
          The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.

                         

          INT. PAROLE REVIEW ROOM, PRISON - DAY

          A PAROLE BOARD OFFICER is reading Max's file as he enters.

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER
           Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a
           seat.
          The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of
          the Board stare at Max.
          The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of
          denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the
          years of his life going by, taking it in...

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)
           Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the
           board why you believe we should grant you
           parole?
          They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent.

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)

                          (HALF AMUSED)
           Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got
           for us this time?
          Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at
          any moment....

           HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

                          (CONT'D)
           (o.s.)
           Mr. Saltzman?

                          MAX
           Well...

                         

          EXT. PRISON GATE - DAY

          The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny
          figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small
          black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s.

           42.

                         

                         
          Max looks a little less sure of himself.

                         HENRY
          Appears. Smiling.

                          HENRY
           I knew you could do it.
          Max looks around nervously.

                          MAX
           Where's the car?

                          HENRY
           I don't have a car.

                          MAX
           You don't have a car? What's wrong with
           you? You came to pick me up without a
           car. That's not picking a person up.

                          HENRY
           Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.

                          MAX
           I don't know about this. Maybe this is a
           mistake.
          Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to
          POUND on them.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Dave! Carl!

                          HENRY
           Max, it's okay. You're free.

                          MAX
           Open up! DAVE!
          No response.
          Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.

                          HENRY
           Come on, Max.

                          MAX
           I don't like this.

                          HENRY
           Take it easy. There's nothing to be
           frightened of. I promise. You're okay.
           The bus station's just a short walk.
          Max starts to hyperventilate :

           43.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe...
          Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...

                          HENRY
           You're going to be alright.

                          MAX
           (nearly on his knees)
           I'm going to die right here. I told you!

                          HENRY
           Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus.
          Henry helps Max back up again.

                         

          EXT. BUS - DAY

          A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside.

                         

          INT. BUS - DAY

          Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max
          has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy.

                          HENRY
           You hungry?
          He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to
          him.
          Max doesn't say anything.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           It's pastrami. On rye.
          A beat. Max opens one eye...

          A KEY GOING INTO A LOCK...

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Henry opens the door for Max. They enter.

                          HENRY
           Here we are.
          Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living
          room. There are some second hand books on the bedside
          table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and
          Dostoyevsky.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           That one's yours.

           44.

                         

                         
          Max goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed.

                          MAX
           Thanks.

                          HENRY
           Anything else you need?
          A beat.

                          MAX
           Yeah.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER

          Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm
          water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and
          relaxes.
          After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side.

                          MAX
           (reads the label)
           Ah. The land of milk and honey.
          Pours it into his bath.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

          As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the
          other side.

                          MAX
           What is this obsession with coffee,
           Henry? When did that happen?

                          HENRY
           I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give
           people a lot of purpose.
          They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.

                         

          INT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY


          THE PROHIBITION-ERA PHOTO
          Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing.
          Max is staring at the thing now too...

                          MAX
           Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was
           eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my
           God. That tunnel's probably not even
           there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?

           45.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           It's a start.

                          MAX
           A start? This was your plan? An old
           cartoon in a pissoir?

                          HENRY
           It's an article.

                          MAX
           Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in
           with guns and do it the old-fashioned
           way?

                          HENRY
           No. No guns.

                          MAX
           What?

                          HENRY
           Someone could get hurt.
          Pause.

                          MAX
           That's sweet, kid.

                          HENRY
           (the tunnel photo)
           Maybe it's still there, Max.
          A beat.

                          MAX

                          (SURE)
           Uh-huh.

                          HENRY
           Maybe it is.
          Max looks at him.

                          MAX
           Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why
           don't we go take a look at this bank of
           yours?

                          (THEN)
           At least we know that's still there.
          Henry looks at him.

                         

          INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY

          Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall.

           46.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Money is a mistress with a hard heart.

          FRANK THE GUARD
          observes Max and Henry. Henry glances over at him too.
          Doesn't react.
          Frank watches them as they walk toward the CASHIER.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I'd like to speak to your manager please.
           I'm interested in opening an account.

                          CUT TO :
          A NAME-PLACARD : `HOWARD TUTTLE, Assistant Manager'.

           MR. TUTTLE (O.S.)
           And which kind of account would you like
           to open?

          ON MAX AND HENRY
          Sitting in front of his desk.

                          MAX
           What kind do you have?

           MR. TUTTLE
           Savings. Interest only. Commercial --

                          MAX

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           You know my uncle put all his money in
           that vault when I was a kid, after we
           came from Europe, before the war...the
           Brownshirts. He said that vault will be
           there for three hundred years!

           MR. TUTTLE
           We hope he's right!

                          MAX
           He was never wrong. How long's it been
           there already Mr. Tuttle?

           MR. TUTTLE
           Since 1891.

                          MAX
           And in the very same spot, correct?

           MR. TUTTLE
           That's right. On the very same spot.

           47.

                         

                         

           MAX.

                          (TO HENRY)
           See, my boy!. History. It's all about
           history.

           MR. TUTTLE
           Now. As I was saying. We have savings.
           Interest only. Commercial --

                          MAX

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           You'll have to give us some time to think
           about which one.
          Max gets up.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Thank you. You've been very helpful.

           MR. TUTTLE

                          (CONFUSED)
           No. Thank you.
          Henry and Max walk out past Frank. He watches them
          leave...

                          FRANK
           Have a nice day, gentlemen.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY, BEHIND THE ORPHEUM - A MINUTE LATER

          MAX AND HENRY stand in the alley. Henry touches the back
          of the bank wall.

                          HENRY
           The vault is here.
          He walks across the alley...

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           The tunnel runs under here...
          He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And ends up somewhere in there.
          He turns to Max.

                          MAX
           It's virtually robbing itself!
          Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it
          SWINGS open.

                          JULIE
           Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov
           shit!

           48.

                         

                         
          She storms out, punches the air, screams :

                          JULIE (CONT'D)

           AHHHH!!
          Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there.

                          HENRY
           (rubbing his head)
           Hi.

                          JULIE
           Jesus. Henry?
          She looks at Max.

                          HENRY
           Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

                          MAX
           Hiya.

                          JULIE
           What are you doing here?

                          HENRY
           Oh, we were, you know --

                          MAX
           I was just showing Henry the place I used
           to perform.
          Henry shoots Max a look.

                          JULIE
           Oh. What?
          The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.

                          SIMON
           That's lunch, Julie.

                          JULIE
           Thank God.

                          MAX
           Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel
           stomach.

                          JULIE
           You know Chekhov?

                          MAX
           Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my
           favorite Russian.
          She laughs. Max approaches her.

           49.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Would you mind if we took a look around?
           It's been over thirty years since I've
           been inside.
          She considers the request.

                          JULIE
           Sure.
          She gestures them inside.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Sure. Yeah. Come on in.

                          MAX
           Thank you.
          As Henry passes :

                          HENRY
           How you doing?

                          JULIE
           Great. I'm in hell.

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Max walks to centre stage front like he's been there
          before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little
          emotional all of a sudden.

                          MAX
           Home again.

                          JULIE
           So what productions were you in?

                          MAX
           Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the
           greats.

                          (A SMILE)
           And the not-so-greats!
          Simon arrives.

                          SIMON

                          (TO JULIE)
           Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek
           says to stay hungry.

                          JULIE
           Fuck him.

                          SIMON
           Got it.
          Max and Henry exchange a glance.

           50.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Would it be a tremendous imposition to
           have a little tour for old time's sake?

                          JULIE
           He used to perform here.

                          SIMON
           I don't see why not. We're on a break.

                          MAX
           That okay, Henry?

                          HENRY
           Sure. Go ahead.
          Julie and Henry watch them go.

                          JULIE
           Is that your dad?

                          HENRY
           No. He's a friend.

                          JULIE
           He seems like your dad.
          Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing,
          getting the feel of it.

                          HENRY
           It's peaceful out here.
          Beat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Is it fun?

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           Pretending to be other people.
          She thinks.

                          JULIE
           It's not really like that. I don't
           pretend to be someone else. I find some
           part of me, and reveal it in a new
           way...just inside of a character.

                          HENRY
           So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.

                          JULIE
           Yes. Exactly. In a way.

           51.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           So what part of `you' are you playing
           now?

                          JULIE
           That's the question you always have to
           ask yourself.

                         

          INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME

          Max follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING

          ROOMS.
          They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing
          very glamorous.

                          MAX
           Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before
           the magic! I remember it like it was
           yesterday.
          They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.

                         

          INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS


                          ARNOLD
           People often make the mistake in Chekhov
           of going down...but you must always
           always go up...
          Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces.
          Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper -

                          MAX
           Simon, did you know there used to be a
           speakeasy down here during prohibition
           days?

                          SIMON
           Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!

                          MAX
           I know.

                          SIMON
           And there was a tunnel too!

                          MAX
           I know!

                          (THEN)
           I forget. Where was it?

           52.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room
          set. Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's
          pulled out of her bag.
          She watches him a moment.

                          JULIE
           So what's your story, Henry?

                          HENRY
           My story?

                          JULIE
           I mean, like...what do you do?
          Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair
          opposite her.

                          HENRY
           I'm figuring that out.

                          JULIE
           Does that mean you don't have a job?
          A beat.

                          HENRY
           I just got out of jail.
          ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.

                          JULIE
           Jail!

                          HENRY
           Sounds worse than it is.

                          JULIE
           Really? Jail sounds bad.

                          (THEN)
           Why were you in there?
          She takes a big bite of her sandwich.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Are you a murderer or something?

                          HENRY
           No. Do I look like one?
          She studies him.

                          JULIE
           No.

           53.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           What do I look like?
          She studies him some more.

                          JULIE
           I don't know. A criminal.
          He laughs.

                          HENRY
           I do?
          She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :

                          JULIE
           Yeah.

                         

          EXT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

          A taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please
          knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside.

                          SIMON
           We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like
           people in his dressing room.

                         

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A costume on hangers. A wig and beard in front of the
          mirror.
          Simon walks into the room. Places his hand on the far wall.

                          SIMON

                          (ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
           It was right here.
          Max comes up. Feels it now too.

                          MAX
           Booze, broads and lucre. The good old
           days. I like it.

                          SIMON
           They filled it in, in 1931 when they
           built the theatre.
          Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing
          it...searching...

                          SIMON (CONT'D)
           Times have changed.

           54.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           All good things must come to...
           (he hits a hollow spot)
           ...an end.
          Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Do you need volunteers?

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          Henry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard
          that's on one of the chairs.

                          HENRY
           The Cherry Orchard.
           (leafing through it)
           So what happens? What's it about? Is it
           funny?
          Julie gets up out of her chair.

                          JULIE
           A woman returns to her family estate in
           the Russian countryside and realizes she
           has no choice but to sell her beloved
           Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her
           youth, the only place she ever felt safe.

                          HENRY
           I guess it's not funny.
          She looks at him.

                          JULIE
           It's about being forced to let go of the
           past and create a new life in order to
           survive.
          Max's voice booms :

           MAX (O.S.)
           That was great! This place is full of
           treasures.
          Max comes right up to them.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon.
           I'll see you tomorrow.

                          JULIE
           Tomorrow?

                          SIMON
           Max has very kindly offered to volunteer
           at the theatre!

           55.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Oh.

                          MAX
           Henry, let's get out of these people's way!
          Henry turns to Julie.

                          HENRY

                          (TO JULIE)
           What are you doing after rehearsal?

                          JULIE
           Why?

                          HENRY
           Do you like Chinese?

                          JULIE
           Yeah.

                          HENRY
           Golden Dragon?

                          JULIE
           It's okay.

                          HENRY
           Eight o'clock?

                         SHE DECIDES :

                          JULIE
           Sure.
          They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage.
          DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.

                          DAREK
           Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!

                          (SEES HER)
           Even you Djula...
          Max grabs Henry --

                          MAX
           Let's go.

                          HENRY
           See you, Julie.

                          JULIE
           Stay out of jail.
          Henry waves.

           56.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

          Max and Henry exit the back stage doors.

                          MAX
           You were right, Henry. You got a nose
           like a bloodhound!

                          HENRY
           You found it?

                          MAX
           Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing
           room.

                          HENRY
           Who?

                          MAX
           Lophakin. We find a way to get into his
           dressing room and we're right as rain!
          Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the
          alley having a cigarette.
          He glares at them as they pass...

                         

          INT. APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATER

          Henry gets ready for his date. Max keeps talking, sitting
          on the side of the tub as he draws the bath...

                          MAX
           I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of
           me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The
           pieces of the puzzle are on the table.
           All we got to do is put them in the right
           order!

                          (THEN)
           The only thing is the dirt...where does
           the dirt from the tunnel go?

                          HENRY
           What about the vault?

                          MAX
           First things first. I'm on the dirt.

                          HENRY
           Okay. How do I look?

                          MAX
           Like Henry.

                          (THEN)
           We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be
           back in the soup.

                          (MORE)

           57.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           (he starts to take off his

                          CLOTHES)
           Go have a nice supper.

                         A CHOPSTICK
          Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking
          them together like...a tunnel...

                         

          INT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Henry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt.

                          JULIE
           Sorry I'm late. I'm starving.
          She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :

                          GUY
           Julie.

                          JULIE
           Bruce.
          The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry.
          She studies the menu.

                          HENRY
           Hi. How was rehearsal?
          She puts it down. No answer.

                          JULIE
           I feel like duck.

                         

          INT. RESTAURANT - LATER


          PLATES ARE CLEARED
          It's the end of the meal. Henry listens.

                          JULIE
           I don't just want to be good, I want to
           be great. And I don't just want to be
           great in Buffalo.

                          HENRY
           Where then?

                          JULIE
           Don't laugh.

                          (THEN)
           Hollywood.

           58.

                         

                         
          He doesn't.

                          HENRY
           I guess that's where people go.

                          JULIE
           I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto
           commercial. And it's not going to be.
           Soon as this thing is done I'm out of
           here.

                          (THEN)
           Before it's too late.

                          HENRY
           Sounds like a plan.
          The waitress brings over the check and the fortune
          cookies.

                          JULIE
           I hate fortune cookies.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S CAR - LATER

          Julie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from
          the ashtray.
          Henry watches her. Julie knows she's being watched. She's
          enjoying herself.

                          HENRY
           We going anywhere in particular?

                          JULIE
           (hits the joint)
           Want some?
          Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.

                          CUT TO :

          HENRY AND JULIE
          Walk along a precipice near some railings. They move
          closer to the ROAR.
          They look out at the flood-lit NIAGARA FALLS. Stand there
          a moment...

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You know there's a whole bunch of bodies
           down there churning around. Just caught
           in the current.

                          (BEAT)
           They all took the risk and look what
           happened to them. Same in death as they
           were in life. Imagine that. You kill
           yourself and nothing changes.

           59.

                         

                         
          They both stare down into the roaring water.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           All those dreams churning around down
           there. It makes you sick.

                          (THEN)
           I got to get out of here.

                          HENRY
           I get it.
          They start to walk...

                          JULIE
           So what did you do before jail, Henry?

                          HENRY
           I worked at a toll booth.

                          JULIE
           Which one?

                          HENRY
           Rainbow bridge.

                          JULIE
           No!

                          HENRY
           Yes.

                          JULIE
           I had family that used to live on the
           other side. I took that bridge all the
           time. We must of met a hundred times!
          He nods. She's probably right.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Wow. So you were one of the guys in the
           tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She laughs.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           What's so funny?

                          JULIE
           You were watching everyone go somewhere
           and you were going nowhere.

                          HENRY
           That's funny?

                          JULIE
           Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.

           60.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I worked nights. It gave me time to
           think.

                          JULIE
           About what?

                          HENRY
           About where I wasn't going.

                          JULIE
           See, that's funny.

                          (THEN)
           What about now? Where you going now?

                          HENRY
           I'm working on it.

                          JULIE
           What'd they send you to jail for Henry?

                          HENRY
           For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.

                          JULIE
           What!

                          HENRY
           I thought I was on my way to a softball
           game. It was a mistake.
          Pause.

                          JULIE
           Sounds like it.
          He looks at her. Decides :

                          HENRY
           But now I'm going to rob it for real.

                          JULIE
           You're going to rob the bank you already
           went to jail for robbing?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Ha!

                          HENRY
           There's a tunnel.

                          JULIE
           What tunnel?

                          HENRY
           Runs from the bank to the theatre.

           61.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           My theatre?

                          HENRY
           Yeah.

                          JULIE
           Ha!
          She looks out the falls.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You're fucking hilarious, Henry.

                          HENRY

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           Thank you.
          A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking...

                          JULIE
           You know what?

                          HENRY
           What?

                          JULIE
           I'm hungry.

                          HENRY
           What for?

                          JULIE
           (as the thought occurs)
           Ice cream.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Henry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table
          eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g.
          They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big
          spoonful.

                          JULIE
           I can't believe I'm sitting here.

                          HENRY
           Neither can I.
          She gets up.

                          JULIE
           I want to dance and clap my hands.
          She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.

           62.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think I must be dreaming!
          She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           God knows I love my country. I love it
           deeply.
          She sits down.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much.
          Henry's not sure what she's talking about.
          She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the
          coffee table.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Page twenty one.
          Henry opens it.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I couldn't see out the train window I was
           crying so much. But I must drink my
           coffee.

                          (THEN)
           Read Lophakin.
          She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly :

                          HENRY
           `I have to go to Kharkov on the five
           o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to
           stay and look at you and talk to you.

                          (TO HER)
           You're as wonderful as ever....'
          He stops, looks at her :

                          JULIE
           Read the next line!

                          HENRY
           `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a
           Parisian...you could blow me down.'

                          JULIE
           Say it like you feel it. Like it's real.
           Say it to me.
          Henry takes a beat.
          This time he makes it his.

           63.

                         

                         

                          `HENRY
           Even more beautiful, and dressed like a
           Parisian...you could blow me down.'
          She laughs like a little girl.

                          JULIE
           You're good. Keep reading! And get up.
           Walk around!

                          HENRY
           `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a
           money-grubber.'

                          JULIE
           Yes, you are. You're a bank robber,
           Henry!
          He laughs.

                          HENRY
           (the text again)
           `I don't care a bit. I just want you to
           believe in me like the old days!'

                          JULIE
           (pulling him around the room)
           Don't stop --

                          HENRY
           `I just want your wonderful tender eyes
           to look at me like they did then.'

                          JULIE
           Again!
          Henry's getting into it.

                          HENRY
           `I just want your wonderful tender eyes
           to look at me like they did then.'
          She laughs some more. Comes closer.

                          JULIE
           I'm glad I ran you over.
          Henry puts the book down.

                          HENRY
           Me too.
          They kiss...

           64.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

          Henry and Julie asleep in the bed. She opens her eyes.
          Realizes he's there with her...as if sensing her, he
          opens his eyes too.
          They look at one another.

                          JULIE

                          (SOFTLY)
           Good morning.

                          HENRY
           Good morning.
          She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Good morning.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Sun streams in through the window. Tchaikovsky plays on a
          tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading
          `Future Shock' on the toilet.
          The sound of the front door of the apartment opening --

                          MAX
           Henry!

           HENRY (O.S.)
           Max.

                          MAX
           (pulling up his boxers)
           I figured it out! Once we're in that
           dressing room the dirt from the tunnel
           goes out through the roof!

                          HENRY

                          MAX --

                          MAX
           (rushing out into the front

                          ROOM)
           That bank doesn't stand a chance.
          HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of
          groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white.
          He's in his underwear.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Ah. Company.

                          JULIE
           Good morning, Max.

           65.

                         

                         
          Max is frozen.

                          HENRY
           It's alright. She knows.

                          MAX
           She does?

                          JULIE
           I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel
           goes out through the roof.
          She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the
          fuck?'

                          HENRY
           We brought breakfast. How do you like
           your eggs?
          Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.

                          JULIE
           It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.

                          MAX
           Hold on.
          Max follows Henry into the kitchen.

                         

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Henry unpacks the groceries.

                          MAX
           You told her?

                          (A WHISPER)
           About what we're doing?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I did.

                          MAX
           It's a crime. You're supposed to keep
           crimes a secret.

                          HENRY
           It's okay, Max.

                          MAX
           No. It's not kosher.
          Pause.

                          HENRY
           How do you like your bacon?

           66.

                         

                         

                          MAX

                          (PISSED)
           Crispy.
          Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's
          waiting, amused by the whole thing.
          Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing
          her up.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Okay. I'll get dressed.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - LATER

          They eat.

                          JULIE
           So what were you in prison for, Max?
          Max slurps his coffee.

                          MAX
           I'm a confidence man.

                          JULIE
           You mean a `con' man?

                          MAX
           I never liked that word. It's only half
           of what it is. The word confidence comes
           from the latin. Fides. With Faith.
           Belief.

                          (THEN)
           That's what I'm about.
          She considers this.

                          JULIE
           You mean you make people feel good...and
           then you rip them off?

                          MAX
           Yes.
          He glances at Henry.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           But I was always much better at the
           feeling good part than the ripping off
           part.

                          (THEN)
           Hence, the prison.

                          JULIE
           Aren't you guys worried about getting
           caught?

           67.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           Not really. For me it's a win-win
           situation.

                          JULIE
           How?

                          MAX
           I like jail. Three hots and a cot.
          Julie looks at Henry now...

                          JULIE
           You too, Henry? You like jail?

                          HENRY
           No. I like it out here.

                          JULIE
           So why would you take the risk? Is it the
           money?
          Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It must be the money.
          Henry smiles.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You are a criminal. A greedy little
           criminal.

                          HENRY
           (washing the plates)
           `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart,
           a money grubber...

                          (THEN)
           ...but I don't care a bit'.
          He turns to her.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           `I just want you to believe in me like
           the old days.'

                          JULIE
           You remember!

                          MAX
           What is that?

                          JULIE
           It's Chekhov!

                          MAX
           Chekhov?!

           68.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           We read it last night.

                          JULIE

                          (TO HENRY)
           You really are good.

                          (TO MAX)
           He's a natural.

                          MAX
           I thought you were on a date.

                          HENRY
           We were.

                          MAX
           Reading Chekhov's a date?
          Beat.

                          HENRY
           Yeah.
          She downs her coffee. Stands.

                          JULIE
           I got to get to the theatre --

                          MAX
           Can you give me a ride there?

                          JULIE
           Why?

                          MAX
           I'm a volunteer!
          She regards him a moment.

                          JULIE
           You weren't in any of those plays, were you?

                          MAX
           No.

                          (THEN)
           But can you give me a ride?

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

          Julie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her
          daughter VARYA are also on stage.

                          JULIE
           All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry
           Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn
           and the winter frosts you are young again
           and full of happiness; the heavenly
           angels have never abandoned you...

                          (MORE)

           69.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Oh, if only I could be free of the stone
           that weighs me down! If only I could
           forget my past!

                         REVEAL HENRY
          Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi-
          darkness.
          He's transfixed.
          Max watches too. He wears his volunteer badge.

                          GAYEV
           Yes and now the orchard will be sold to
           pay our debts, which seems impossible...

                          JULIE
           Look! It's mamma walking in the
           orchard...in a white dress!
           (laughing with joy)
           There she is.

                          GAYEV
           Where?

                          VARYA
           Momma, don't!
          A PROJECTION OF THE MOTHER FLOATS ACROSS THE SCREEN and
          dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees...
          Henry and Max speak in hushed voices :

                          MAX
           This is driving me crazy.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           We could be digging right now!

                          HENRY
           We could?

                          MAX
           If we were in that dressing room.

                          HENRY
           It's rehearsal. There are people
           everywhere.

                          MAX
           This is pissing me off.
          Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he
          is...freezes...
          ...then turns back to Henry...

           70.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           I got an idea.

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           You have to be Lophakin!

                          HENRY
           What?

                          MAX
           If you did we'd be able to get into that
           tunnel whenever we want.

                          HENRY
           I'm not an actor.

                          MAX
           You're not a bank robber either! And
           you're doing that.

                          HENRY
           Max. Come on.

                          MAX
           She said you were a natural. That means
           you can do it.

                          HENRY
           No, it doesn't.

                          MAX
           Yes, it does Henry.

                          (SHAKES HIM)
           You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from
           nothing. A man who's not afraid to create
           a new life.

                          (POINTS)
           A man who's in love with her!
          Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Your dream is your truth is your destiny!
          Henry thinks...

                          HENRY
           I can't be Lophakin. They have a
           Lophakin.
          Max thinks...

           71.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           What if they didn't?

                          HENRY
           There has to be another way.
          Max, frustrated :

                          MAX
           Kid, You forced me out of jail to help
           you. And I'm going to goddamn help you.
           But you got to help me help you. Now I
           need to know...
           (a fierce stare)
           ...do you want this bank or not?
          On Henry...

                          HENRY
           Yes. I want it.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Then you're gonna be Lophakin!

                          CUT TO :

                         

                         ARNOLD
          Walks down the street. It's snowing. He approaches the
          theatre.

                         

          INT. THEATRE, BACKSTAGE - MORNING

          Arnold enters, shivering, shaking the snow off his
          coat...

                          ARNOLD
           Good morning, everyone!
          None of the actors pay him much attention. He pours
          himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his
          dressing room.

                         

          EXT. DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

          Arnold opens the door with his key.

                         

          INT. THEATRE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Arnold enters, hangs up his coat. There is a FORMAL
          ENVELOPE leaning against his make-up mirror.
          He approaches. Opens it. Starts to read...

           72.

                         

                         
          As he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp..
          and...falls into his chair.
          After a moment he puts down the letter and stares at
          himself in the mirror.

                          ARNOLD
           You knew this day would come. You deserve
           this, lubya.
          He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - MORNING

          CLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead
          pulsate with rage...

                          DAREK
           Unprofessional shit!

                          ARNOLD
           Mr. Millodragovich --

                          DAREK

                          (HISSING)
           Shit!

                         

          INT. THEATRE - MORNING

          Julie stands in the wings. Max joins her.

                          MAX
           What's happening?

                          JULIE
           Arnold's leaving the production.

                          MAX
           Oh. Gosh.

          DAREK AND ARNOLD
          on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in

                         ARNOLD'S FACE :

                          ARNOLD
           But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman
           we're talking about!
           (brandishing the letter)
           A Ken Waterstone production!

                          DAREK
           OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production.
           The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.

                          (MORE)

           73.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Run, run, to that pandering, populist,
           piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his
           spineless productions! You're perfect for
           it.

                          ARNOLD
           Good-bye, Darek.

                          (THEN)
           I'm sorry.
          Arnold marches off the stage with his case.

                          DAREK
           Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.

                          (CALLING OUT)
           I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes
           NOW! And COFFEE!

                          SIMON
           We'll hold auditions this afternoon,
           Darek! I'll get the list --
          Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate :

                          DAREK
           I've seen that shit-list! It's a
           disaster.

                          SIMON
           What do we do?

                          DAREK
           I must think.
          He moves stage left past Julie...

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled
           before she has a chance to grow.
          And with that he disappears with Olga out the door.

                          JULIE
           Perfect.
          Beat.

                          MAX

                          (A SHRUG)
           It is Ken Waterstone.
          She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes...

                         

          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as
          she approaches her car.

           74.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but
           that's what's happening...

                          (SHE LISTENS)
           I don't know, he's `thinking'...
          She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the
          ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window.
          She looks up. It's MAX.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           What?
          He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Sorry, I can't give you a ride --

                          MAX
           You said he was a natural.

                          JULIE
           Stan. Let me call you back.
           (she hangs up, to Max)
           What?

                          MAX
           Henry.

                          JULIE
           Henry what?

                          MAX
           Henry would be perfect for it.

                          JULIE
           Perfect for what?

                          MAX
           For Lophakin.
          It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.

                          JULIE
           You mean Henry should play Lophakin?

                          MAX
           Yes.
          She laughs.

                          JULIE
           He's not even an actor!

                          MAX
           Exactly. He'd be playing himself.
           (off her shocked look)
           Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.

                          (MORE)

           75.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           A man who came from nothing. A man who's
           not afraid to create a new life and put
           his past behind him. A man who's in love
           with you...Madame Ranevsky.
          A beat. She does think about it.

                          JULIE
           Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly
           shifting under my feet?

                          MAX
           Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin
           needs a dressing room.

                          (BEAT)
           Can you get him in to see Darek?
          She hesitates...

                          JULIE
           What's going on here, Max? What are you
           doing?

                          MAX
           Nothing.
          She regards him. Suspiciously.

                          JULIE
           You made this happen, didn't you?

                          MAX
           Sometimes a good guy needs a less good
           guy to help the good guy be good.
          He smiles. A beat :
          She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Fair enough.
          They just sit there for a moment...

                          JULIE
           What am I supposed to do now?

                          MAX
           He just needs a shot. One audition. Let
           the chips fall where they may.

                          JULIE
           What if it doesn't work?

                          MAX
           They'll get someone else.
          She thinks...

           76.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm
           asking, Julie.
          She thinks some more...

                          JULIE
           Okay, confidence man.

                         

          INT. DAREK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Julie sits, looking at Henry who stands in the middle of
          the living room of Darek's apartment...

                         DAREK
          Circles HENRY...walking around him...an animal tracking
          its pray...he's chain-smoking...

                          DAREK
           ...you've never had any training...you've
           never been in a production...you don't
           even know the play...

                          HENRY
           I read it. I think I know the scene.

                          DAREK
           Think.
          He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Start.

                          HENRY

                          (READING)
           `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'

                          DAREK
           How can you perform Chekhov and not be
           able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!

                          HENRY

           ANDREYEVICH.
          Darek nods, continue :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm
           an upstart, a money grubber --

                          DAREK
           A what?

                          HENRY
           A money-grubber!

           77.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           Are you?

                          HENRY

           NO!

                          DAREK
           Convince her.
          Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie. She stands :

                          HENRY
           Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm
           an upstart, a money grubber. He can say
           whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --

                          DAREK
           (into his ear)

           NEITHER DO I.
          Henry ignores him and with twice the passion --

                          HENRY
           I just want you to believe in me like in
           the old days.

                         JULIE WHISPERS :

                          JULIE
           Show me, tell me.
          Darek laughs, circling...
          Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...

                          HENRY
           Good God in Heaven. My father was one of
           your father's serfs, and your
           grandfather's serf before that.
           But you, you did so much for me in the
           old days that I've forgotten all that...
          His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I love you...like a sister...more than a
           sister.
          Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.

                          DAREK
           You piece of shit! Yes!
          Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable.
          A beat.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Good.

           78.

                         

                         
          Henry looks up.

                          HENRY
           Good?

                          DAREK
           Yes.
          Darek considers him.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow. Be more good.
          Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING

          She drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the
          road ahead. In silence.
          After a while...

                          JULIE
           Does this make me an accessory?

                          HENRY
           I think so.
          A beat.

                          JULIE
           Things have certainly gotten a lot more
           interesting since you showed up.

                          HENRY
           You mean since you ran me over...
          She smiles.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          They make love. It's more intense than before. They
          climax.
          They lie there, breathless, looking at each other...

                         

          INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT

          She makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her.

                          JULIE
           So why are you robbing the bank, Henry?
          He doesn't answer.

           79.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           It's not just about the money, is it?

                          HENRY
           No.

                          JULIE
           So why are you doing it?
          It takes a moment for him to answer.

                          HENRY
           I used to sit in that toll booth and
           think about just getting in one of those
           cars, going wherever they went. Just
           joining someone else's life.

                          JULIE
           You were asleep at the wheel.
          Henry smiles.

                          HENRY
           Yeah, I was.

                          (THEN)
           It was easier for me to go to jail than
           tell my wife the truth.

                          JULIE
           Which was?

                          HENRY
           That I was going along with everything. I
           didn't know I could change it.

                          (THEN)
           So now I'm changing it.

                          JULIE
           Robbing the bank is changing it?

                          HENRY
           It already has.
          She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her
          tea.

                          JULIE
           What was your wife like?

                          HENRY
           Nice.
          A beat.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Are you sure you're okay with this? I
           know it's a lot.
          She turns to him.

           80.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           Not for a girl like me, Henry.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING

          Darek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side.

                          DAREK
           This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be
           taking over the role of Lophakin. If you
           please.
          He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges

                         IT:

                          HENRY
           Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.

                          DAREK
           Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga,
           cigarettes!
          Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him...

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING

          Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind
          him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on.
          They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall
          aside.
          Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling
          rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the
          sound.
          Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag :

          WHACK!
          He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN...

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - LATER

          The blanket is pulled aside to reveal MAX AND HENRY on
          the other side looking in. Max shines his flashlight

                         REVEALING :

          THE EMPTY OLD TUNNEL BEYOND
          It's dusty. Max climbs through the hole, disappears down
          the tunnel. Henry follows, counting his steps...

           81.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. OLD TUNNEL - DAY

          Max and Henry, stooped over, make their way down the
          dank, dark passage.
          Max's flashlight combs the floor. A glint of light now as
          something FLASHES.

                          MAX
           Tracks! Trolley tracks!
          The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the
          end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten
          feet ahead.
          They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick,
          turns to Max.

                          HENRY
           There's still twenty feet to go.
          He turns back to him :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           We're going to need another pair of
           hands.

                         

          EXT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

          It's cold out. Max and Henry walk inside.

                         

          INT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

          A giant screen showing the game. Henry and Max arrive at
          the bar.

           LOUD VOICE (0.S.)
           No! No! NO! You got to be kidding me! You
           suck! You SUCK! Could you possibly SUCK
           anymore?

                          HENRY
           That's him.

                          MAX
           That's him?
          Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair.
          Max looks concerned.

                         

          INT. BOOTH - LATER

          Henry and Max sit with the guy -- JOE who's drunk.

           82.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Thanks for meeting us.

                          JOE
           Sure.
          Joe is looking worse for wear.

                          HENRY
           How's your pyramid scheme?

                          JOE
           It wasn't a pyramid scheme.

                          HENRY
           Okay.
          Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.

                          JOE
           It all fell apart.

                          (THEN)
           We were banking on that money, Henry. And
           now all I've got is a garage full of dumb
           Korean plastic.

                          MAX
           What's he talking about?

                          HENRY
           Kitchenware.

                          MAX
           Oh.

                          JOE
           See what happens when a person tries to
           go `legit'?

                          (THEN)
           It's killing me.
          Joe drains his beer. The WAITRESS arrives with a bucket
          of steaming wings.

                          HENRY
           So how's Debbie?

                          JOE
           She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a
           couple months.
          He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.

                          HENRY
           She's pregnant?

                          JOE
           Yeah, she's pregnant.

           83.

                         

                         
          Henry takes it in.

                          HENRY
           Congratulations.

                          JOE
           Thanks, Henry.

                          (THEN)
           It's okay if you want to punch me out.
           Tonight would be a good night. In fact I
           could use it.

                          HENRY
           Come on. This is great news.
           (off Joe's hopeless look)
           It's going to be okay.

                          JOE
           Really? It is? You know how much diapers
           cost? You know how much it costs to send
           a kid to college?

                          MAX
           You want to send your baby to college?
          Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...

                          JOE
           Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid
           needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive.
           Stuff it deserves.

                          (THEN)
           These things are hot! I'm on fire.

                          HENRY
           Listen, Joe, maybe we can help.
          A beat.

                          JOE

                          (WIPING OFF)
           How?

                          HENRY
           We might have a job for you.
          Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water,
          looking at both of them now.

                          JOE
           No foolin'?

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - DAY

          Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the
          tunnel.

           84.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom
           of that vault.

                          JOE
           That's a lot of dirt, Henry.
          Max studies Joe.

                          HENRY
           So what do you think?

                          JOE
           I think we should get some guns and go
           get the money through the front door!

                          HENRY
           No guns. People could get hurt.

                          JOE
           What about fake ones?

                          HENRY
           They're still guns.

                          MAX
           Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and
           we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers
           and tears and chump change. We're doing
           an old fashioned heist. We're going right
           into the belly of the beast.

                          (THEN)
           Are you in or are you in?

                         ON JOE
          Considering it...
          He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.

                          JOE
           I hope we don't get caught.

                         

          INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Henry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The
          TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie
          snaps it off.

                          JULIE
           I hate that commercial.

                          HENRY
           I like it.
          She looks at him.

           85.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           So what's your plan?

                          HENRY
           For what?

                          JULIE
           For when it's done. After.
           (making light of it)
           Am I going to see your picture in the
           post office or something?

                          HENRY
           I hope not.

                          JULIE
           But have you thought about what happens
           after?

                          HENRY
           Not really, no.
          He thinks carefully before he says it :

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out
           west...

                          JULIE
           Out west?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.

                          JULIE

                          (SHE LAUGHS)
           When did you think of that?

                          HENRY
           Just now.

                          (THEN)
           So what about it?

                          JULIE
           What about what?

                          HENRY
           Meeting me --

                          JULIE
           -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --

                          HENRY
           You're not?

                          JULIE
           No.

           86.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I thought that was your plan. Do the play

                          AND --

                          JULIE
           Plans change, Henry. Okay?
          She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think I ran out of maple syrup.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          We follow Henry as he walks through her apartment and
          finds Julie in the kitchen, standing at the sink, not
          moving.

                          HENRY
           Is there a reason you didn't leave
           before?

                          JULIE
           Because life is fucked. It never works
           out the way you want it to.
          Silence...

                          HENRY
           Yeah. Well. Maybe...

                          (THEN)
           But you could still meet me.

                          JULIE
           Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.

                          HENRY
           It was just an idea. Why not --

                          JULIE
           This isn't going to work out, Henry.
          She turns to face him.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Didn't we both know that?
          On Henry.

                          HENRY
           I didn't.

                          JULIE
           I did.
          Silence.

           87.

                         

                         

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I think you should leave.
          Henry just stands there...stunned.

                         

          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - NIGHT

          Henry leaves Julie's apartment. There's snow on the
          ground. It's freezing out here.
          He starts to walk.

           MAX (O.S.)
           It's going to be incredible. I'm talking,
           Florida...

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table.

                          MAX
           Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can
           eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your
           head!
          Henry sits across from him.

                          HENRY
           Why couldn't I have met her after?

                         

                          MAX
           Who?

                          HENRY
           Julie. I asked her to meet me. After
           we're done.

                          MAX
           Oh yeah? What'd she say?

                          HENRY
           She said no.

                          MAX
           Of course she said no.

                          HENRY
           Why of course?

                          MAX
           Because life ain't like that. There's
           always a cost. That's why they call it
           life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper
           must be paid to pipe.

           88.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           I paid already, Max.

                          (THEN)
           I don't want to leave her.
          Max looks at him. About to say something --
          A KNOCK at the door.

                          MAX
           Who's that?

                          HENRY
           I'll check.
          Henry walks to the door.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Who is it?

           JOE (O.S.)
           It's me. Joe.
          Henry opens it. JOE stands there. He's drunk. And a
          little sheepish. Now we see why : EDDIE VIBES is standing
          right beside him. He walks right on in.

                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Sorry, Henry.

                          EDDIE
           The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's
           poetry! I like it.

                          MAX
           Who is this guy?
          Eddie beams at Max.

                          EDDIE
           Your new partner.
          Max looks at Henry : `huh?'

                          MAX
           What do you mean?

                          EDDIE
           I'm in. Or you're out.

                          JOE
           I screwed up. Sorry, Max.
          Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.

                          EDDIE
           (amused by the whole thing)
           Joe tells me you guys might need a little
           help with that vault. I know the whole story.

           89.

                         

                         
          He sits.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           And I don't dig. Dig?

                          (THEN)
           Got any cold ones?

                          MAX
           Joe doesn't know what he's talking about.
           He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out
           of that chair.
          Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.

                          EDDIE
           Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back.
           We've known each other since high school,
           isn't that right?

                          HENRY
           Yeah. I know you.

                          EDDIE
           Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut,
           Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the
           quality of loyalty.

                          HENRY
           What do you want, Eddie?

                          EDDIE
           Nothing. Just the American dream.

                          CUT TO :

          MAX AND HENRY
          At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car.
          He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the
          thumbs up.

                         

          INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

          Max and Henry watch Eddie leave.

                          MAX
           I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.

                          HENRY
           You can't kill him.

                          JOE
           (slurred, on the floor)
           Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got
           the vault --

                          MAX
           Shut up, Joe.

           90.

                         

                         
          He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy
          it would be to just kick him in the head.

                          JOE
           Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's
           born. Says the kid'll know about it.

                          MAX
           Go home. Please. Before it's too late.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          INT. STAGE - DAY

          Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from
          the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal.

                          TROFIMOV
           I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's
           sake, the man has robbed you.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           (stopping her ears)
           No! No! No! Don't say that!

                          TROFIMOV
           He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but
           you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user...
          ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie
          sees him.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You are twenty six or twenty seven, and
           you're still in the lower grades!

                          TROFIMOV
           Who cares?
          She locks eyes with Henry now :

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You ought to be grown up by now. At your
           age, you ought to understand about love --

                          DAREK
           Where are you, Djula? Where?!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           (with double the fire)
           You ought to love someone yourself! You
           ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!

                          DAREK
           Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.

                          (THEN)
           Carlotta and the girls.

                          (MORE)

           91.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)

                          (A CLAP)
           Let's run the magic scene!
          Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for
          her.

                          HENRY
           What happened last night?

                          JULIE
           I came to my senses.

                          (THEN)
           And you should too.
          She walks on. He follows...

                          HENRY
           We should talk about it.
          She turns.

                          JULIE
           I don't want to, Henry.

                         

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

          Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of
          dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up
          through the open skylight.
          Henry looks up.

                          MAX
           (tugging the pulley)
           Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it.
          Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel
          is deeper now and all lit up...

                         

          EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER

          Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car.

                          JOE
           What do you think guys? If it's a boy do
           I cut him or not?

                          MAX
           Well, you know what they say, cleanliness
           is next to Godliness.

                          JOE
           What do you say, Henry?
          Before he can answer :

           92.

                         

                         

           VOICE (O.S.)
           I see you guys in the bank. I see you
           guys in the alley next to the bank.
          They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right
          there. He's in his street clothes.

                          FRANK
           Now I see you coming out of the theatre
           behind the bank.
          Frank sucks his teeth.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I know what you're up to Gentlemen.
          Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves
          closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           And I want in.

                          MAX
           In on what?
          Frank snickers.

                          FRANK
           We can't talk here. Let's drive.
          Max looks at Henry.

                         

          INT. JOE'S CAR - DRIVING

          Joe's driving. Max is in the passenger seat. Henry in the
          back next to Frank.

                          HENRY
           What's on your mind, Frank?

                          FRANK
           The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency
           Retrieval and Exchange.
          They exchange glances.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Once a month a truck goes to all our
           partner banks across the border in
           Canada, picks up all the currency and
           brings it back home.
          They're listening...

           93.

                         

                         

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'd say on average eight to twelve
           million, held in our vault at First
           Buffalo for just a few hours before it's
           picked up for redistribution.
          Now they're paying attention.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank
           any other time.
          A beat. He leans closer...

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I can give you that date. I can help with
           alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.

                          MAX
           Hypothetically say you were right about
           what we're up to...which you're not. But
           just say...why would you help us rob your
           bank?

                          FRANK
           I got my reasons.

                          JOE
           This sounds like a set-up, man --
          Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.

                          FRANK
           I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I
           got my reasons.

                          MAX
           Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going
           to need to hear them.
          A beat.

                          FRANK
           The wife got sick a few years ago.
           Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs.
           So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help
           cover the difference. We were going to
           retire to the Loire valley.

                          (DARKLY)
           We had to use all our savings to cover
           the bills.

                          JOE

                          (GETTING IT)
           The man gave it to you, huh.

           94.

                         

                         

                          FRANK
           I spent everything we had -- then she
           died...thirty years I've been at that
           bank.

                          HENRY
           What was her name?

                          FRANK
           Annie. Her name was Annie.

                          HENRY
           I'm Sorry.
          The moment just hangs there...

                          FRANK
           November 23rd. The money's delivered at
           eight and picked up at midnight.
          He turns to Henry.

                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I retire in two weeks. This is it.

                          (THEN)
           You set up the table. I make sure dinner
           arrives hot.

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - MORNING

          MAX and HENRY walk up to the theatre. They've got
          coffees. It's drizzling.
          They both look up.

                          HENRY
           Shit.
          ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens
          NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM"

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Opening night.

                          MAX
           And?

                          HENRY
           That's soon.

                          MAX
           We're going to have pull some nights.
          Henry thinks...

                          HENRY
           Maybe we should wait. Do it closing
           night.

           95.

                         

                         
          Max turns.

                          MAX
           We can't. He's retiring. This is a one
           time deal.

                          (THEN)
           I told you there were going to be tests,
           Henry.
          Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You're going to have to leave her.

                          (BEAT)
           No looking back.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          AN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled
          inside.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT


                         REVEAL HENRY
          Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the
          far end.
          The doors open for him...he hesitates

                         HENRY'S POV
          DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated
          receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly.
          Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches
          through the glass a moment...
          Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.

                         HENRY
          Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the
          answers he needed...

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

          Max and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it
          for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the
          tunnel.

                          MAX
           There he is!

           96.

                         

                         
          Henry picks up his shovel. Starts to dig. He goes at it
          hard.
          Max catches his mood.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You okay, Henry?

                          HENRY
           No.
          He turns to Max.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm not leaving her.

                          JOE
           Who?

                          MAX
           The girl --
          He throws down his shovel.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Now listen, Henry. You're digging this
           tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank.
           You're gonna take the money and you're
           gonna put it in the car and we're gonna
           drive away.

                          (THEN)
           This is one thing. Julie is another
           thing. This is not that. That is not
           this. Understand?

                         ON HENRY

                          JOE
           Hey! I think I got something...
          Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt
          above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free
          burying Joe who struggles to get out.
          Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth
          surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.

                          MAX
           We have arrived! Look at that.
          Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment.
          Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky.

           97.

                         

                         

                          HENRY
           Not a cloud in the sky.

                          MAX
           So clear you can see tomorrow.

                          (THEN)
           You're a good man, Henry. Thank you.

                          HENRY
           You too, Max. Let's go.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - NIGHT

          A line at the box office. THEATERGOERS mill around,
          waiting for friends or chatting, everyone anticipating a
          great evening of theatre.

                         

          INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE, GREEN ROOM - SAME TIME

          The cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green
          room, chatting nervously to one another.

          HENRY AND JULIE
          Standing on opposite sides of the room.
          Hush descends as DAREK walks in.

                          DAREK
           In this `American dream' of ours,
           everyone is happy and smiling, they have
           achieved their objectives...and yet in
           life there is only change, upheaval, the
           birth of the new...and that birth is
           painful.

                         ON JULIE
          avoiding Henry's gaze.

                          DAREK (CONT'D)
           Our play is about misery, disconnection,
           a future that we don't see hitting us
           like a train...but tonight, my players,
           we show them...that this not a future to
           fear!
          He leaves. The players applaud --

                          GAYEV

                          (THRILLED)
           Off the cushion in the corner ; double
           into the centre pocket!
          Everyone laughs.

           98.

                         

                         

                          SIMON
           Ten minutes people!

                         

          INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

          Julie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up. A knock
          on the door.

                          JULIE
           Come in.
          Henry appears. She's surprised.

                          HENRY
           I want you to meet me in California.

                          JULIE
           Henry, we've been over this --

                          HENRY
           We're doing it tonight.
          She sits there...

                          JULIE
           What?

                          HENRY
           It's the only time we can get in the

                          VAULT --

                          JULIE
           Of course! Opening night. What else? Like
           I said, everything always fucks up --

                          HENRY
           Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a
           month from now, what's the difference? I
           still want you to meet me.

                          JULIE
           Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked
           around recently? You're leaving. What
           about the goddamn play?

                          HENRY
           Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it
           already.

                          JULIE
           I'm sure he did.
          He approaches her...

                          HENRY
           I want us to be together.
          She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.

           99.

                         

                         

                          JULIE
           We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So
           what?

                          HENRY
           You know that's not true --

                          JULIE
           No, really. A couple of times.

                          (THEN)
           Don't you get it? I don't want to be with
           you.
          That cuts him dead.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You're a thief. Go rob your bank.
          A beat. He leaves.

                         

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          Max helps seat some elderly people.

                          MAX
           Enjoy the show, folks!
          He checks his watch...it's two minutes to eight. He walks
          briskly up the aisle...

                         

          INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - NIGHT

          Frank watches through the glass doors out onto the empty
          street.
          He looks at his watch, sucks his teeth.

          INT. THEATER - SAME TIME


                         SIMON
          On a headset. Points to Henry.

                          SIMON
           Curtain!
          ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise...

          THE CURTAIN COMES UP TO REVEAL :

                         THE NURSERY
          a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may
          but frosty.

           100.

                         

                         
          Through the windows. CHERRY TREES in full bloom which
          contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set.
          They're BIG SCREEN projections on real tree trunks :
          LOPHAKIN enters with DUNYASHA, holding a candelabra.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Well, thank god the train is in. What
           time is it?

                          DUNYASHA
           (checks his watch)
           Almost two.
           (blowing out the candle)
           It's light already.
          Henry yawns and stretches.

                          LOPHAKIN
           The train's late. At least two hours.

          AN ARMORED BANK TRUCK
          Rounds a corner into view...

                         

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          ...pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank.
          BERNIE and STAN jump out. Bernie knocks on the glass door.

                          BERNIE
           How you doin', Frank?
          He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back
          of the truck.
          Through the glass, Frank smiles.

                          FRANK
           Doin' good, Bernie. Real good.
          He sucks his teeth.

                         

          EXT. BACK DOOR - THEATRE

          Max bursts out the back door of the theatre, his walk
          turning into a run...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Julie as Madame Ranevksy enters the nursery in rapt
          delight.

           101.

                         

                         

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet
           nursery! This is where I used to sleep
           when I was a little girl!
          Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to
          say hello...instead she breezes past him.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           I'm still like a little girl...
          She kisses Gayev and Varya and then Gayev again. She
          kisses everyone in fact, except Lophakin.

                          GAYEV
           Your train was two hours late. How do you
           explain that? Is that good management?

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Bernie breaks the seal of an envelope, hands it to Stan.
          Frank unlocks the plastic casing to the VAULT KEYPAD for
          Stan who punches in the CODES on the slip of paper that
          was inside the envelope.
          Frank reaches into his pocket. We glimpse his phone. He
          presses `SEND'...

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open
          electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out,
          reads it.

                         "YOU"
          He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his
          hands are trembling and he drops it...
          Thirty feet to the ground.

          CRACK!

                          MAX
           Shit.

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from
          the side of the stage.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood!
           I used to sleep in this nursery.

                          (MORE)

           102.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           I looked out from here into the garden. I
           woke up happy every morning.

                          HENRY
           Isn't she beautiful?

                          SIMON
           Yes.
          She looks out toward the window through which there is
          now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal
          decay...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my cherry orchard...

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME


                         ON FRANK
          Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into
          the vault.

                          BERNIE
           You ever think what you could do with all
           that money, Frank?

                          STAN
           I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and
           put them in first place.

                          BERNIE
           You'd need a lot more money than that.
           But I guarantee you I'd have them back in
           the Super Bowl within two seasons.

                          STAN
           Perfect. Another chance to lose.
          Frank laughs nervously.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

          Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his
          watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again.
          Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire.

                          MAX
           Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little
           pischer?
          He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :

           103.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Bernie and Stan place the last of the money in the vault.

                          BERNIE
           We're good.
          Bernie closes the vault.

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan returns to the keypad. Begins pecking in the re-
          arming code --

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          AS Max quickly attaches the CIRCUIT BYPASS WIRE...

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan completes the code. Just as he's about to hit the
          `Enter' button --

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max CLIPS the bypass onto the other side of the wire and
          the NUMBERS START TO COME UP.

                         

          INT. BANK - SAME TIME

          Stan hits `enter' -- the vault CLANKS again. Locked. A
          RED LIGHT indicates the alarm is on.

                         

          EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

          Max looks at the screen. ALL THE NUMBERS MATCH. The red
          light turns GREEN.
          He sighs, relieved.

           LOPHAKIN (O.S.)
           I saw this excellent piece of theatre
           yesterday. Really very funny.

           104.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. STAGE - NIGHT -- SAME TIME


                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I
           believe people like you should examine
           their own lives instead of going to the
           theatre to observe other peoples!

                          LOPHAKIN
           True enough. To be honest. We live a
           stupid life.

                         

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BANK - SAME TIME

          Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck.

                          STAN
           Well this is it, Frank.

                          BERNIE
           We got you something.

                          STAN
           A little retirement gift.
          Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift.

                          STAN (CONT'D)
           Go ahead. Open it.
          Frank does. It's a bag of coffee.

                          FRANK
           Thanks guys.

                          BERNIE
           We wanted to get you something from
           France.

                          STAN
           You like French Roast, right?

                          FRANK
           Thanks.

                          (THEN)
           You know this isn't from France.

                          BERNIE
           What are you talking about? It's French
           roast.

                          FRANK
           Right. But over there they call it coffee.

                          STAN
           (slightly baffled, at Bernie)
           But this is French roast...

           105.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

          Joe and Eddie in the tunnel, waiting. Eddie looks at his
          watch.

                          EDDIE
           Where is he? Where's that old man?

                         

          EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - SAME TIME

          Max pulls open the door, sweating, runs inside...
          straight into Julie.

                          MAX
           Julie -- Break a leg!

                          JULIE
           Play's already started, Max.
          She walks past him.

                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Good-bye confidence man.

                          MAX
           Good-bye, Julie.

                         

          INT. HENRY'S DRESSING ROOM AREA - SAME TIME

          Max hurries down the stairs, rushes into Henry's dressing
          room.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Max opens the armoire, looks inside to a waiting Joe and

                         EDDIE --

                          MAX
           Go! Go! Go!

                          EDDIE
           About time, old man.

                          MAX
           Do your job.
          Joe leans over and pukes on the ground.

                          EDDIE
           Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?

                          JOE
           Sorry.

           106.

                         

                         
          Eddie looks at him.

                          EDDIE
           You're a pussy, Joe, you know that?
          Eddie grabs the drill. Starts to make a hole. Joe starts
          to prepare the charges...

                         

          INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

          Lophakin and Madame Ranevsky perform.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?

                          LOPHAKIN
           I tell you every day. Every day I say the
           same thing over and over. You must rent
           out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of
           the Estate for villas. At once, right
           this second, the auction is coming up
           very soon --
          A muffled BOOM (o.s.)
          Henry freezes. Julie looks at him.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           It's all so vulgar!
          Another muffled BOOM (o.s.) this time the audience looks
          around. Julie glares at him.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry rushes in to the tunnel to find Joe and Max staring
          at the underside of the steel bank vault. It's like a
          gleaming jewel.

                          MAX
           That was good, kid. Good acting.

                          JOE
           (a little giddy)
           There she is.
          Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs
          it.

                          EDDIE
           Get out of there!
          Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite
          burning tool.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           This shit comes straight from hell.

           107.

                         

                         
          They scramble out. He puts his protective helmet on.
          Lights it. It's like an inferno

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME


          WHITE HEAT AND SPARKS
          EDDIE's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed,
          screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in
          front of him.
          KRUUUNK! The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground.

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - A MINUTE LATER

          Smoke clears to reveal EDDIE. He pulls off his hood.

                          EDDIE
           Welcome to my world, bitches.
          They all look up at THE HOLE.

                          JOE
           Fuck, yeah.

                         ON HENRY

                         

          INT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole.
          He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH,
          subdivided into bricks.
          He sits on it. Thinking...
          It's dead quiet in here.
          Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash :

                          MAX

                          (SMILING)
           You're on, Henry!

           MADAME RANEVSKY (O.S.)
           Is the cherry orchard sold?

                         

          INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Audience's POV as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the
          other side of the stage. It's like a showdown.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Yes.

           108.

                         

                         

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Who bought it?
          Pause.

                          LOPHAKIN
           I did.
          Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes
          her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage.

                          LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)
           I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush
           me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk...

                         

          INT. VAULT -- SAME TIME


          EDDIE, JOE AND MAX
          Stuff duffel bags full of cash.

                          JOE
           Deb's gonna freak.

                         

          INT. STAGE - NIGHT

          Lophakin swirls on stage...

                          LOPHAKIN
           ...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine.
           Mine!

                          (LAUGHING)
           God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is
           mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out
           of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!

                         

          INT. TUNNEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER


          EDDIE, JOE AND MAX
          Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door.

                          MAX
           That's everything.

                          EDDIE
           Yes, it is.
          Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there
          with A GUN pointed at him and Joe.

                          MAX
           What's that, Eddie?

           109.

                         

                         

                          EDDIE
           It's a gun, Max.
          Max doesn't seem so surprised.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           (with the gun)
           Joe! Take the money out back to my car.
          Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Joe!
          Max boldly steps right in front of the gun.

                          MAX
           Stay right where you are, Joe.
          Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.

                          EDDIE
           Don't be stupid, Max.

                          MAX
           You're not going to do this, Eddie.
          Eddie smiles.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You can shoot me dead if you want, but
           you're going to have to shoot me dead.
          Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head
          as he throws him back.

                          EDDIE
           I'm not playing with you, old man.

                          JOE
           What are you doing, Eddie?
          The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene...

                          EDDIE
           Welcome to the party, Brando.
          Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the
          middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on
          the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.

                          HENRY
           What are you doing, Eddie?
          Eddie turns at him.

                          EDDIE
           It's money, Henry. Money.

           110.

                         

                         

                          MAX
           This was your chance you idiot. You
           could've been a better man but you did it
           again. You messed up. And now you're back
           with the maggots. Just one big missed
           opportunity.
          Eddie kicks him again.

                          JOE
           Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're
           done. He's right. Come on, man.

                          EDDIE
           Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in
           the car. Shut up.
          He turns back to Henry.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you.
          He gestures to the tunnel.
          Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from
          behind. THE GUN GOES OFF. They wrestle. Joe bites Eddie's
          hand.

                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
           You animal!
          Max, straddling Eddie, grabs his head, bangs it on the

                         GROUND :

                          MAX
           Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin
           son of a bitch!
          Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.

                          JOE

                          (TO HENRY)
           Get the extension chord.
          He does. They roll Eddie over, start to hog tie his hands
          then his legs.
          Eddie starts to freak out.

                          EDDIE
           You couldn't have done this without me.

                          MAX
           Our new partner. Huh.
          Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still
          kicks like crazy.
          Max notices Henry's thigh.

           111.

                         

                         

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You ok?
          Henry sees it now too. It's a graze.

                          HENRY
           I got shot.
          Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I gotta get on stage.
          He rushes out...

                         

          INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

          On stage, the lights come up revealing a LINE OF HOODED
          FACELESS FIGURES standing behind the scrim, axes by their
          side.
          They walk out onto the stage...

                          GAYEV
           Thank you, my friends, thank you.
          Lophakin rushes on stage. He's late. Yasha, holding a
          tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look.
          Madame Ranevsky enters from the other side, hands out
          cash to the line of hooded figures.

                          YASHA
           The peasants have come to say good-bye.

                          (THEN)
           They're good fellows, Yermolai
           Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little
           stupid...

                          GAYEV
           (to Madame Ranevsky)
           You gave them everything in your purse,
           Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it.
          Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring
          him on their way out.

                          LOPHAKIN
           (still a little out of

                          BREATH)
           Won't you please come here and drink a
           glass as a good-bye?

           112.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

          Eddie, gagged and bound, lies in the middle of the tunnel
          as Max closes the door to the dressing room.

                          MAX
           Old man, huh.
          Eddie tries to scream but he can't. As Max shuts the door
          all light is blotted out.

          THE PEASANTS/HOODED FIGURES
          positioned now by the cherry trees behind the scrim and
          back-lit.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           We're going and not a soul will be here
           until after we're gone.

                          LOPHAKIN
           Until spring.
          She notices he's clutching his thigh...

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

          Max and Joe load the last of the duffels filled with cash
          into the back of Joe's car...
          They get inside. Joe starts the engine...

                          JOE
           Where is he?

                          MAX
           Any minute now.

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME


                          ANYA
           Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!

                          TROFIMOV
           Hello to the new life!
          Trofimov exits with Anya. Varya looks around the room and
          exits. Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog.
          Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev :

                          LOPHAKIN
           Until the spring, then. Goodbye my
           friends, until we meet again!

           113.

                         

                         

                         ON HENRY
          As he and Julie exchange a final look. She watches him
          go...it's as if he's moving in slow motion...

                          GAYEV
           My sister! My sister!

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My
           life, my youth, my happiness, farewell!
           Farewell!

           ANYA (O.S.)
           Mamma!

           TROFIMOV (O.S.)
           Aa-oo!

                         

          EXT. THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

          Henry comes out the back door. Gets in the car.

                          MAX
           How's the leg?

                          HENRY
           It's fine. Go.
          Joe guns it.

                         ON HENRY
          Sitting in the back.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          INT. STAGE -- SAME TIME

          The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes. They
          suddenly have the manner of executioners...
          They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved
          orchard.

                          JULIE
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           One last look at these walls, these
           windows...Dear mother used to love to
           walk about in this room.

                          GAYEV
           My sister! My sister!

           ANYA (O.S.)
           Mamma!

           114.

                         

                         

           TROFIMOV (V.O.)
           Aa-oo!

                          JULIE
           (as Madame Ranevsky)
           We're coming.
          The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees
          behind her. It's horrific.
          Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls
          to the ground...and begins to weep...

                         

          INT. CAR - SAME TIME


                          HENRY
           Stop the car!

                          MAX
           Henry!

                          HENRY
           Joe, stop the car.

                          MAX
           He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!

                          JOE
           Yeah, you can't --

                          HENRY

           STOP THE FUCKING CAR!
          Joe screeches to a halt. Henry gets out of the car.

                          MAX
           What the hell are you doing?
          Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he
          can...
          Max sticks his head out the window.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Henry!
          But he's already gone...

                         

          INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

          The HOODED FIGURES finish destroying the orchard. TREES
          litter the stage...
          Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on
          the ground...

           115.

                         

                         
          As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to
          walk off the stage...

                         SHE FREEZES :

          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
          Coming down the aisle is
          HENRY as LOPHAKIN
          Pause.
          He comes closer. He's limping slightly....

                          LOPHAKIN
           I had to come back. I couldn't get on the
           train. The moment I stepped on the
           platform, the blood drained from my
           heart.
          ON JULIE, in shock.

                          LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)
           I knew I might never see you again.
          He steps up on the stage...

                         ON DAREK

                          DAREK
           What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!

                         ON HENRY

                          LOPHAKIN
           I had to come back.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY

                          (A WHISPER)
           Henry, what is this? What are you doing?

                          LOPHAKIN
           This is the only way you'll listen to me.
          She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting
          Madame Ranevsky's response...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           You should have gotten on that stupid
           train. You made a mistake.

                          LOPHAKIN
           The mistake would have been getting on that
           train without telling you how I feel.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All
           you care about is money.

           116.

                         

                         
          She tries to get past him. He blocks her.

                          LOPHAKIN
           You think this is about money?

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Yes.
          He grabs her.

                          HENRY
           It's never been about money. You know
           that.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Let go of me!

                          LOPHAKIN
           No.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Damn it! Just leave, Henry!
           (under her breath)
           Get off the fucking stage --

                          HENRY
           Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           No, I'm perfectly happy here.

                          HENRY
           That's not true. Meet me in Moscow.
          She tries to get away again...

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Let me go!

                          HENRY
           I can't.
          Pause.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           Why are you doing this?

                          LOPHAKIN
           You're just afraid.

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           I'm not afraid of anything --
          She kicks out at him.

           MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)
           What am I afraid of Henry? Tell me!

           117.

                         

                         

                          LOPHAKIN
           You're afraid because I love you.
          That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping
          back...

                         SHOCKED ACTORS
          On the side of the stage.

                         ON JULIE

                          MADAME RANEVSKY
           ...what?
          She searches his expression now...

                          HENRY
           Meet me in Moscow.
          She can't move. The audience is rapt.

                          HENRY (CONT'D)

                          (SOFTLY)
           Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.
          There are tears in her eyes now...

                          AUDIENCE MEMBER
           Go with him!

           ANOTHER AUDIENCE MEMBER
           Meet him in Moscow!

                         DAREK
          at the back of the theatre. Stunned :

                          DAREK

                          (TO SIMON)
           He loves her.

          JULIE AND HENRY
          She whispers softly. Looks down at his leg.

                          JULIE
           Henry. You're bleeding.

                          HENRY
           I know.

          IN THE BACK
          Darek is alive once more...

           118.

                         

                         

                          DAREK
           (whisper to Simon)
           Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly...
          Julie and Henry in silhouette now.

                          JULIE
           Oh, fuck, Henry...
          The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
          appears on the projection screen...

                          FADE DOWN :

                         

          FADE UP ON :

                         

          EXT. THE LOIRE VALLEY, FRANCE - DAY

          ...which become REAL BLOSSOMS on a CHERRY TREE, widening
          to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever
          seen.

          A STONE FARM HOUSE
          Frank sits at a table outside in the garden. He pours
          himself a Pernod. He looks happy as a clam.
          A CAT jumps in his lap, purring.

                          FRANK
           Hello miou-miou.
          He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.

                          CUT TO :

          THE SOUND OF A CRYING BABY

                         

          INT. PRIVATE DELIVERY ROOM, SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO -


                         DAWN
          A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been
          spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the
          video camera.
          THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And
          screaming its little lungs out.

           JOE (O.S.)
           It's a girl!!!

                          DEBBIE
           A girl.

           119.

                         

                         
          A NURSE hands the baby to Debbie. Joe looks on, tears
          stream down his face.

                          CUT TO :

                         

          EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY

          We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters
          a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR

                         GROOMING"

                         

          INT. MAX'S BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk
          GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his
          customer's ear off.

                          MAX
           Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy
           things with it. Education. Self-respect.
           You can even figure out your dream.
          The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan.
          He pulls the sheet off his client.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You're done. Next!
          Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them
          waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick.
          The front desk girl hands Max the mail.
          CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our
          destiny...Love H... xx'
          Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he
          pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is --
          an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.

                          MAX (CONT'D)
           So tell me, Javier. What's your dream?

          THE SOUND OF BREATHING
          Fade up on : what looks like the AFRICAN BUSH.
          It's hot. There are insects buzzing around and it doesn't
          look like rain's landed anywhere near here in years.
          A HAND reaches out for another HAND, helping someone over
          the final step.

          REVEAL HENRY AND JULIE
          Sitting right below the Hollywood sign now...

           120.

                         

                         
          Looking down on the whole basin of Los Angeles. She hands
          him a bottle of water. He drinks.

                          JULIE
           Look. You can see the ocean.
          He puts his arm around her.

                          HENRY
           `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a
           money grubber...but I don't care a bit.'
          She laughs...they kiss in the sun for a while...

                         

          FADE TO BLACK

          CREDITS START TO ROLL...

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - BUFFALO - DAY

          EDDIE VIBES is being questioned by the unseen DETECTIVE.

           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
           I'm only going to ask you one more time,
           Eddie. Who was it? Who helped you?

                          EDDIE
           I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy
           and Doc --
          WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under
          the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :

           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
           You know what you are Vibes? A liar, a
           cheat, a thief and a loser.
          He presses his boot down harder ON EDDIE'S FACE :

                          EDDIE
           I may be all those things but one thing
           I'm not...is a rat.
          Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's
          a pretty strange kind of smile...
