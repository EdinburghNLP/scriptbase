                                  Written by

                                  Ben Ripley





<b>                                                          1/18/2007
</b>
                         

<b>                         SOURCE CODE
</b>          Darkness.
          A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S
          WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS...

<b>          INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
          Slowly he turns his head to one side...
          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
          their morning commute into a city.
          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
          strobe pattern.
          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
          It reads 7:40 a.m.
          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
          He has no idea where he is.

<b>          EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
</b>
          The train hurls straight at us.
          NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
          turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
          Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
          seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER
          BAG. Is that his?
          Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
          NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."�
          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
          starting to freak him out.
          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
          soda.
          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
          bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Ma'am?
          Nothing.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Excuse me... ma'am?
          She looks up. Blank stare.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What is this?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          What's what?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Where am I?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          (looks out the window)
          Almost at Newark.
          Goes back to her journal.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What's Newark? A city?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          It's more of a hell hole.
          But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
          slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Woah.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          I think I'm going to puke.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          (gestures, alarmed)
          Okay, bathroom's that way.
          Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Go. Seriously.
          Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length
          of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.
          The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."�
          Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...

<b>          INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING
</b>
          He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,
          the passengers are different.
          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A
          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Ticket?
          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
          keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          May I see your ticket?
          The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
          pockets.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't think I...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Have to write you up then.
          He pulls out a citation pad.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Is this...?
          From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
          conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it
          here. Where's this train headed?

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          New York. Penn Station.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          New York?
          Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
          happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination
          simply continues.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Do you know where I got on?
          The conductor examines his ticket again.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Princeton Junction.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Where's that?

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          "˜Bout ten minutes back.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          But I've never been to Princeton
          Junction. See... I don't remember
          waking up or buying a ticket or
          getting on the train or anything
          else. It's just a blank.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Lucky you.
          The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
          confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased
          slightly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Okay. You're gonna figure this
          out.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - FIRST CAR - MORNING
</b>
          Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must
          be at least forty people.
          As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
          A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.
          A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
          DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...
          A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,
          listens to an MP-3 player.
          An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.
          A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a
          guidebook.
          A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
          tabbed file box.
          An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
          None of them pays any attention to Colter.
          A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
          An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
          Like the exhalations of a creature.
          A SCRAPE. He looks to see
          A woman FILING HER NAILS.
          Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
          heightened, near the point of overload.
          He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
          from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.

          turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
          DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
          name on the license reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."� The same name as

          She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
          writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.

          disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
          Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of
          them towards the station building.

          The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom.

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.
          He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in
          stainless steel.
          He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on

          He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic.
          He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Wake up!
          The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train,
          obliging him to hang on.
          This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from.
          The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he
          blinks.

          Warehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New
          Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City.
          From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which
          Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door.

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Colter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his
          hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks
          through the closed door.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          You left your bag on the seat.
          Which is a flagrant violation of

          No answer.

          She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the
          door. The oddness of this situation.

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face.
          Practically catatonic at this point. And then her voice --

          been riding this train every

          Christina's walking back down the aisle.
          The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on
          the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a
          whoosh, and it's gone.

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC
          RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.
          Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.
          What are they doing in the sink?
          He looks UP.
          An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it
          is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE.
          Something is sitting up there.
          From outside comes a TRAIN HORN.

          Through the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other
          way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers.

          Colter looks up into the crawl space. Can't quite see the
          object up there.
          Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the
          toilet. Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he WRENCHES IT
          all the way open. Then PULLS himself uncomfortably upward.
          On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers

<b>          A MASSIVE BOMB
</b>          It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied
          together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind

          Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain
          reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the
          windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.
          Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of
          flames.
          On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in
          the intense heat.
          One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering

          tracks...
          It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an

          gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.

          Colter opens his eyes...
          SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to

<b>                         LOOK OUT
</b>
<b>          A TRAIN WINDOW
</b>          At the passing woodland scenery.
          He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
          Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
          Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
          Everything is exactly the same as before.
          Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern."�
          Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
          Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
          the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
          steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
          the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
          buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
          window, bursting with summer leaves.
          Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
          same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
          a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
          the canvas messenger bag beside him...
          This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
          bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY."�
          He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
          good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.

          Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of

          Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the
          faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the
          Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on.
          All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of
          unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts.
          Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter.
          Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory

          The STITCHING on a leather purse.
          A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray.
          AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent.

          An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's

          It's too easy.
          Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just

          with distaste.
          A small number of passengers get up, among them the College
          Student. He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a
          WALLET from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock
          Broker, who's about to get off the train.

<b>                         COLLEGE STUDENT

          The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him
          closely.
          As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
          forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained
          urgency.

<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)

          The doors slide open.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Newark Station.
          The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
          hurries past them towards the station house.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
          platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
          station house.
          The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
          right move?
          As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory

<b>                         IMPRESSIONS:
</b>          The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,
          hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.
          The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
          track.
          The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
          of the tracks.
          The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
          Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
          Entering, Colter stops. There's no sign of Guzman. Just an
          empty marble lobby. A lone CLERK restocks timetable
          brochures at a display.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>          (not looking up)
          Lots of guys come through here.
          Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no
          sign of Guzman out there.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          He was just here. A Middle Eastern-
          looking guy.
          Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the
          College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the
          College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.
          A muffled COUGH.
          Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."�

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era
          sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          The train to Philadelphia will be
          four minutes late... The train to
          Philadelphia will be four minutes
          late...
          Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's
          room. The last stall door is SHUT.
          From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.
          Colter edges closer.
          A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
          awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          All better now?
          Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his
          hands.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Don't much care for trains myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          26.
</b>          The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's
          face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this
          disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.
          Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him
          in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
</b>
          Colter emerges in the lobby. Guzman is nearby. A bit
          indecisive. Colter wanders over to the newspaper stand.
          The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.
          Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.
          What will Guzman do?
          Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
          and back out on the train platform.

<b>          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
</b>
          Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          I resent this. This is harassment.
          You obviously work for someone.

<b>                         (BITTER)

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          How are you going to pull this off?
          That bomb has a cell phone
          detonator. And I don't see a pay
          phone around here. So I'm betting
          you got a phone on you with the
          number already programmed in.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          I have no idea what you're talking
          about. I am an international
          business man. An executive.
          The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
          of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Open your briefcase. Prove to me
          there's no phone in there.

          WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
          Guzman sprawling to the ground.
          Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
          simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
          Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
          is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
          photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.

          Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.

</b>          Where the hell's your phone?
          Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
          Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
          triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
          Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
          malice.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I thought so. Now let's see you

          A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,
          looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is

<b>          THE EXPRESS TRAIN
</b>          Closing in on the station.
          The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
          the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
          Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
          cell phone. Which has remained off.

          Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned
          out by the ROAR of

<b>          THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN
</b>          With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO
          THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
          its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
          Everything stops.
          Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
          itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
          smothering, forgetful SILENCE...
          For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than
          before), the same flickering after-image appears:

<b>          THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --

          The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back
          into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang
          on and gasp for air.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Holy fuck!

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)

          Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight
          suit.
          The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from
          their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's
          sweated off five pounds.

          windows. Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the
          train exploded. Time is running down.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Now let me tell you about you. You
          work at the New York Public
          Library. You've been eyeing me for
          months on this train but haven't
          said a word to me. You're bland
          and colorless and predictable. And
          now I see you're delusional, too.
          Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window.

<b>          COLTER'S POV
</b>          Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing
          serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport.
          The view is wiped away as the FREIGHT TRAIN comes surging
          past the windows. But the sight of the plane has already
          caused something to click in Colter's head.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Son of a bitch. "CAOC-N."� That's
          not army. That's Air Force.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Are you mocking me?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          They're running this whole thing
          out of Nellis Air Force Base in
          Nevada. Fucking Nevada!
          Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this
          delusion after what she's confessed about herself.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          (racking his brain)
          What's there? What's on that base?
          B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat
          Command. Predator Drones. Remote
          operations.
          (something to this)
          This a remote operation.

<b>                         (FINALLY)

<b>          42.
</b>          A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his
          radio. We catch the words "bomb threat."�

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What did he say?
          A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around
          uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to
          me again.
          She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.
          Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY --

<b>          5... 4... 3...
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Christina!
          He grabs her -- she struggles against him --

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Get off me!
          But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and
          squeezing his eyes shut as --

<b>          THE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES.
</b>          Blinding light. Painful to look at.
          Like a star exploding.
          A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss.
          And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view:
          A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it...
          A woman.
          It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring
          smile.

<b>          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Click -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is
          malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's
          face in and out of darkness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          43.
</b>          The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-
          functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
          Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
          capsule's tomb-like cold.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin? What's happening? Come
          in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
          cold in here.
          He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
          had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
          The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin!
          It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
          He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
          A terrifying silence.
          The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
          the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
          around. Then...
          The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
          activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
          begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
          the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
          Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
          HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
          But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
          He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
          incredibly cramped.
          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
          hull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          44.
</b>          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
          Daunted by the complexity.
          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
          of his hands.

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Come on!
          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
          He's burned his fingers.
          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
          electric HUM.
          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
          craft.
          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          -- four principle dialects of
          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
          Lebanese and North African. We
          will now play you portions of each,
          discussing the audible differences
          between them.
          CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
          Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
          fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
          With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
          reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
          return. The icicles begin to DRIP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          45.
</b>          Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
          The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
          Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
          background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
          technicians wander by.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
          He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
          Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
          another world.
          It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
          whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as

<b>          RUTLEDGE.
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Can you hear me?
          Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
          a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Project designer initiating

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm here! I'm okay!
          Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Is someone there?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Yeah. It's me. Colter.
          Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Wow! It's you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          The capsule lost power. It's still
          pretty cold in here.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          We've been working towards you from
          the other side. Nice to have you
          with us again. You feeling all
          right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          46.
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I think so. Who are you?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          The name's Rutledge.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          They wouldn't let me talk to you
          before.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          No, I guess not. They're pretty
          anal around here.
          (lights his pipe)
          Don't tell them you saw me smoking
          in here, okay?
          His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
          military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You're the inventor of this thing.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>
<b>                         (SHRUGS)
</b>          I prefer the term project designer.
          And sorry for all the secrecy.
          Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
          established contact.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't want to deal with Goodwin
          anymore.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          What?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Don't you understand? He's
          torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
          you get me out of here?
          Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
          deal with personnel issues.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Why would Goodwin have it in for
          you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          47.
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          He's a remote operator. And remote
          operators are risk averse pussies
          who sit at control screens in the
          rear while actual pilots like me
          put their asses on the line in the
          field.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          He seems pretty devoted to the
          mission.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          And just what kind of mission is
          this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
          he let me save those people on the
          train?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Because they can't be saved.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Why not? I know what's going to
          happen. I could take apart the
          bomb. Stop the train.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
          Source Code, not here. Not in our
          own past.
          Mystery upon mystery.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What's the difference?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I'm not sure I should be telling
          you this.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Telling me what?
          Coaxing the scientist in him.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          It's quantum physics. Linear
          algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
          would take weeks to explain.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Is Source Code time travel?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          48.
</b>          Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          It's gone out again.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Why can't I save those people on
          the train?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Think of it like this: events in
          our past can never be undone.
          Einstein proved that.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          So...

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          So Source Code opens up another
          past for you. A parallel past. It
          looks the same but it has no
          intersection with our own world.
          In essence, by sending you back, an
          entirely new but utterly parallel
          world is created. It looks
          identical to ours, but nothing you
          do there has any effect on this
          reality.
          At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What happens to the Source Code
          world after I leave it?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I don't know. You can never know
          that because you're not there to
          observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
          Maybe not.

<b>                         (UNEASY)
</b>          I should tell them you're okay.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What about the bicycle?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          What bicycle?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I see it each time. Right after
          the bomb goes off. Like an after

          property to his invention.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

</b>          Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me.
          Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin
          settles back into his seat, donning the headset.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Lower your pulse. The situation
          has worsened. The fire on the
          tracks caused one of the freight
          cars to blow up and release some
          kind of gas. As a precaution
          they're having to evacuate all of
          lower Manhattan.
          Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to

          evacuate parts of New York City.

          The rich smell of steaming coffee. The glint of a polished
          leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a
          fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,
          the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of
          the mighty machine coursing over the rails.
          If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Believe me, I don't have the answer
          for anything.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          There's a vision. I keep having
          it. It's very powerful. And
          you're in it. And there's a
          bicycle. And this... old stone
          wall. And it's very peaceful.
          Does this sound familiar? Like
          where you live, maybe?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Stone walls? My parents live in a
          house with aluminum siding and an
          American eagle over the door. The
          only bike is a Harley which the guy
          down the street revs at three in
          the morning.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          The vision must mean something.
          It's the only time when I'm not on
          the train or in the capsule. Why
          else would Rutledge be so
          interested?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Who's Rutledge?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Someone who was trying to help me
          understand something. Until they
          got to him.
          He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train
          begins to slow down.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          I saw a program on TV. It was
          about psychics. They say psychics
          have a lot of paranoia.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't believe in that shit.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Newark Station.
          Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid
          disembark. Guzman hurries past them to the station house.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          All aboard. Doors are closing.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Don't you have people you can go to
          for help? Friends, family?
          The train begins to move again.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Most of my friends are in the
          military. My dad runs a melon farm
          in Alabama.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Maybe now's the time to reach out
          to him.
          She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his
          hand.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Me and my dad, we don't see eye to
          eye. We're just two different
          people.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          As opposed to being the exact same
          person?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Are you always this sarcastic?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          This is so not about me.
          Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings --

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What day is it?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          June 11th.

</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          June?
          One more thing to puzzle him.
          The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
          The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer.

<b>          DONALD (V.O.)
</b>          Hello?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Dad?
          Donald doesn't respond.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Dad, it's me. It's Colter.
          Again, silence.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Been a while, huh? I'd been
          meaning to call you, but --
          Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          He wanted me to stay on and take
          over the farm but... I had other
          ideas.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          You're intimidated by him.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          You're scared of him. I can see
          it.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          The hell I am.
          Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
          connects.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Dad, don't hang up. We're going to
          talk. I need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          61.

<b>                         DONALD

<b>                         (CONTROLLED ANGER)
</b>          Now you listen to me. Whoever you
          are, never call here again.
          Donald hangs up.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          He's still mad at you, huh?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          No... it was like he didn't even
          know who I was.
          Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS
          TRAIN flashes by.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          I don't know how to help you.
          She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
          Retreating inside himself.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Sorry to have bothered you.
          He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          Back in his seat. Lost in the view out the window. The
          neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.
          Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          I have a friend.
          Surprised, he turns to find her there.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          She works at the New York Times.
          Her name's Stephanie. She's just a
          proofreader, but she wants to be
          made a reporter. She's always
          saying she needs a good story to
          bring in so she gets noticed.
          Something like this, with a crazy
          paranoid angle could really
          interest her.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Forget it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          62.
</b>
<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          She could do some poking around.
          She's already quite suspicious of
          the government.
          Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
          window.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          I'm getting voice mail.
          (into the phone)
          Steph, it's Christina. You know
          that story you're always looking to
          write? I might just have something
          for you. I met a guy. His name is
          Colter Stevens. He says he's in
          the army. He flies helicopters in
          Iraq, but now they've put him into
          a secret project called Source
          Code. Maybe you can look into it a
          bit, okay? Call me.
          She hangs up. Pleased with herself.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          She'll call back. Just wait.
          None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Thank you, ma'am.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>
<b>                         (LAUGHS)
</b>          Ma'am? How old do you think I am?
          He gives her a wary look. Considers.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Twenty five?
          She smiles, pleased.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          No, but thanks.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          What did you mean, there's a
          criminal on the train? How do you
          know that?
          Colter looks away. Careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          63.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I just do.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          How can I help you if you don't
          tell me everything about this?

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to
          follow him into the bathroom.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You said you wanted to know.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Can't you just tell me?
          He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
          next to him.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Try anything and I'll kill you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Shut the door.
          As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          What are you doing?
          He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          It's up here.
          He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
          sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the
          crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest
          of the way.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          (startled, feels his hands

<b>                         ON HER)
</b>          What are you --

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Just look.
          Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
          as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          64.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Is that...?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid
          explosive. There's fourteen
          cannisters of it. Simple
          detonator. Cell phone signal
          closes the circuit and boom.
          He lowers her. An incredulous beat.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Did you put this here?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          No. It was someone else. They
          don't know who. That's why I'm
          here. To find out.
          Watching her. Will she believe him?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          We have to tell someone. We have
          to stop this.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.
          Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          It won't matter. The train's
          already...

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Already what?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I've been sent here. It sounds
          crazy, but it's true. I've been
          sent from the future -- from five
          hours in the future. This train's
          already been blown up.
          She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You wanted to know. Now you know.
          She turns and hurries for the exit doors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          65.

</b>          This isn't happening. I've got to
          get off.
          Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's
          stabbing at the door release button.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Why won't it open?!
          Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the
          number.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          It's Steph.

<b>                         (HOLLOW)
</b>          I told you she'd be interested.

<b>                         (ANSWERS)
</b>          Hi.
          Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens.
          Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at

<b>          HIS WATCH --
</b>
<b>          50 SECONDS.
</b>          It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom --

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Tears open the door. Jumps up on the sink.

<b>                         THE BOMB
</b>          Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the
          bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb,
          he hears --

<b>          CHRISTINA (O.S.)
</b>          Colter...?
          Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips
          away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives --

<b>          CHRISTINA (O.S.)
</b>          Colter, I have to tell you
          something.
          -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone. Ducking back
          down, he see Christina standing in the doorway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          66.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Look. Now the fucking thing can't
          go off.

<b>                         HIS WATCH
</b>          Reads 20 SECONDS.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Stephanie did a computer search.
          Something in her expression worries him.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          She's got a database of all
          newspaper articles going back to
          forever.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Source Code's classified. It
          wouldn't be in a newspaper.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          No. But you were. She found you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          She found me? What does that mean?
          She stops. Not wanting to go on.
          From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
          train.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Jesus Christ, Christina, are you
          going to spit it out?
          In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
          amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and
          number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,
          Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          According to the notice, you were
          killed in action two months ago.
          The world stops.
          A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and
          doubles over. She runs to him --

</b>          Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand
          POINTS on an array. Christina's cries become bursts of
          static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE -
          - the Source Code architecture laid bare.
          And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a
          frightening series of HALLUCINATORY FRAGMENTS:

<b>          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
          A PILOT'S P.O.V. -- desert sand, searingly bright -- flight
          deck instrumentation -- a windshield pockmarked with bullet
          holes -- the horizon tilting as the helicopter PLUNGES
          towards earth amid a chaos of RADIO TRANSMISSIONS:
          "...taking a lot of RPG fire... be advised A61 is going
          down... A61 is going down hard..."�

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne,
          P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher.

<b>          INT. MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
          Airborne again. The thud of rotors. Through blurred vision
          we see medics working furiously to save a life.

<b>          INT. C5 TRANSPORT JET - DAY
</b>
          The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular
          pulsations of a VENTILATOR. Fluids drip down through an IV
          bag. Tubes and monitors stacked all around us. Gurneys of
          other wounded packed together. The grumble of another,
          unseen wounded soldier:

<b>          SOLDIER (O.S.)
</b>          Never any damn leg room on a plane.
          An ALARM begins beeping.

<b>          68.
</b>          Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide
          projector. The Jack of Clubs.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain...?
          The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
          dissolves.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain, allow me to introduce
          myself. My name is Goodwin.
          You're with Beleaguered Castle.
          You are safe. All your needs will
          be met here.
          Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking
          cursor.

<b>          FADE TO BLACK.
</b>          A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
          bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain?
          The sound drives away the image, replacing it with

</b>
<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain, just tell me what you see.
          Just look and speak.
          Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:

<b>          COLTER (V.O.)
</b>          I see a card.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Very good. Very, very good.

<b>          INT. ISOLATION UNIT
</b>
          On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.
          Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching
          there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
          On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
          situation.

</b>          Are you comfortable? Are you warm?
          Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing
          entirely from existence.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Do you need to urinate?
          Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Beleaguered Castle is waiting for
          your report.
          Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
          a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the
          1970s, comes on:

<b>          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)

          Left ear.
          A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES.

<b>          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
</b>          Hearing Test. First sequence.
          Right ear.
          The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Captain, I know you can hear me.
          Did you find the bomber?
          Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.

<b>          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
</b>          Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke,
          she had the bed to herself. She
          sat up, bewildered by the
          strangeness of her surroundings;
          then memory returned, and she
          looked about her with a shiver."�
          Goodwin stops the audio.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          As you're collecting your thoughts,
          I should tell you there's been
          another development. A terrorist
          group has taken responsibility for
          bombing the train.

<b>                         GOODWIN (CONT'D)
</b>          This began broadcasting over the
          Internet a half hour. We've traced
          it to central Asia.

<b>          ON THE MONITOR
</b>          A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-
          away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face
          hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a
          flickering camp fire and a tea service.
          The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
          launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his
          black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It
          begins speaking to the camera.

<b>                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
</b>          (on camera, in accented

<b>                         ENGLISH)
</b>          By now you have suffered a taste of
          divine vengeance. God willing, you
          will soon suffer another.
          Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
          listening.

<b>                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
</b>          These attacks will show you that
          you will never be safe. You can
          secure your borders. But what can
          you do against one of your own
          citizens? One who looks like you,
          who is blameless, living already
          among you, who takes eighty million
          of our dollars, a trifle, and
          carries out our bidding? You
          cannot stop this. Time has run
          out.
          The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
          Goodwin.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Let me talk to Rutledge.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          So you've decided to speak.

          later date.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Will you let me out of here?
          Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Frankly, Captain, we're
          disappointed.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Find Rutledge! Now!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I have to say that we expected more
          from you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Stop! Stop reading from your
          goddamn script!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Perhaps we overestimated your
          abilities.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I swear to fucking Christ!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Please accept the criticism in the
          spirit it was given. Perhaps a few
          memory exercises would help.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't need your criticism and I
          don't need your memory exercises,
          you gutless freak. And by the way,
          that bomb is detonated by a cell
          phone. When activated, the phone's
          display screen displays caller ID
          information. Caller ID. I wonder
          if that information would be useful
          to Beleaguered Castle.
          For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
          the cold clinician goes back up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          72.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Very well. We're ready for that
          information.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You'll have to send me back. I
          didn't get a good look at it. But
          I will next time.
          Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          What assurance do we have you'll be
          able to read the screen before the
          device detonates?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, there's no time left.
          Send... me... back.
          Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes
          are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead
          luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he
          wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...
          intently scanning...
          There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in
          his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE.

<b>          CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the
          Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.
          Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the
          arm. She gestures down the aisle to

</b>          Hey, do you have my phone?
          People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just
          starts walking faster.

          The Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in
          sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car.
          PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it

<b>          CLICKS SHUT.
</b>
<b>          INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING

          Breathless, Colter has just finished shutting the door and is
          about to use the cell phone when sees
          THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL
          Looking over at him in surprise.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Sorry. Wrong turn.
          Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment.

<b>          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
</b>
          Just as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the
          third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the
          other way.

<b>          INT. FIRST CAR - MORNING

          Sweating a bit now, Colter is keying in a number on the cell

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Don't you understand? I'm in it,
          Goodwin. I'm calling you from
          inside the mission. Inside the
          Source Code.
          A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Next stop New York Penn Station.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          This contact is ill-advised. I
          must ask you to hang up.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I
          can't get out.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          You have no authorization to be
          making this call. Goodbye.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget
          authorization. There's no time.
          Soon you're going to find out what
          happened on this train. And then
          your own day is going to start.
          But not until then. Right now it's
          just you and me talking. And
          you're a different Goodwin than the
          one I'm going to go back to in a
          few minutes. You're separate from
          him. Separate worlds. Do you
          understand?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I think so.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy
          in all of this, and you have your

</b>          But here and now, just this once, I
          need to ask you something. And you
          need to tell me the truth.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I'd rather you not ask me anything,
          Captain.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm going to ask it.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I should terminate this call.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get
          through to you? You're not just a
          soldier. Somewhere inside you're a
          human being, too. Somewhere inside
          you've got to know that this is
          wrong. Source Code is wrong. And
          if you can't grasp that, if you
          just follow orders, then you're
          just as much a prisoner as I am.
          The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet
          returns as it recedes.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          What's your question?
          Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Did I survive that helicopter crash
          in Iraq?
          Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Answer me. Did I survive that
          crash?
          Another pause. This is crushing Colter.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Not physically.

          crash.
          A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to
          stay brave.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Not physically? Fuck. At least
          give me an answer I can understand.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)

</b>          But... the capsule I'm in...

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          A manifestation. Your way of

          This is crushing. Colter fights back terror.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You had no right.

</b>          As a soldier...

<b>                         COLTER

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          It was the only way. You couldn't
          have a body and be sent back into
          the Source Code.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I suppose not. You're right to
          keep it from me.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          That's what we do. Keep stuff from

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          You must realizes the army's made
          an investment in you. You'll be
          used again.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          How?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Imagine a turntable. With a record
          spinning on it. All we do is lift
          up the needle. The music stops.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          And then what?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Then we wait. Until another
          mission. And the needle comes down
          again. You won't remember any of
          this. We'll start with the playing
          cards. Electronic tones. Simple
          memory exercises. Bit by bit,
          we'll revive your cerebral
          capacities once more.
          The barbarism of it. Digital slavery.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          How many times have I done this?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Does it matter?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          No one knows I'm here. No one can
          help me.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          In stimulating your cortex, they're
          prolonging your life. Many

          to death.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You can't do this. I served my

</b>          What?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          The courts know you're here.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Military court or civilian court?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Military.
          Colter finds no comfort in this.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I'm sorry you found out about all
          of this. That wasn't our
          intention.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Does that make it any less wrong?
          No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running
          out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:

<b>          COLTER'S FACE
</b>          Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel

</b>
          Its appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new
          awareness of what this really is. The capsule is even more
          claustrophobic. There are fewer controls. Even less light.
          A shadow world.
          The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void --

          Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the
          headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at
          the camera.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Drop it. I know about the

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

</b>          You can do better than that. They

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          If you think I'm enjoying this,
          you're wrong.

</b>          What's their offer? What can they
          possibly threaten me with after so
          colossally fucking me? Spit it
          out, you spineless turd.
          Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever
          spoken to him like this before. After a sputtering pause,
          Rutledge's mouth hardens.

</b>          The government can decide to take
          an interest in people. People like
          your father with his struggling
          farm. It can discover things like
          unpaid property taxes. It can call
          in his equipment loans or tie him
          down for years in environmental
          litigation. On the other hand, it
          can pay him handsomely for mineral
          deposits he never knew were there.
          As distant and problematic as your

          The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing. Replaced by
          the oppression of being back in the capsule. Back in
          Rutledge's power.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I think so. But there wasn't time

          Colter does not answer.
          The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered.

          Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror.
          Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb
          blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him
          with impatience.

          The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin.

          She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond.
          Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle.
          But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape.
          Imprisoned in both worlds.
          From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment
          in him.

          He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen

          A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen
          them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid. And
          the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the
          doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding
          out Derek's wallet.

          Leaving just Colter and Christina there. The doors stand
          open, invitingly.

          He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her
          to join him. A coaxing look.
          She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Who in the world are you?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Leave me alone.
          She retreats back into the car. Colter is heartbroken.
          About to pursue her, he happens to look over and see

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek
          continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as
          if intending to reboard further down.
          And then it happens.
          With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open
          door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the
          station house.
          With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the
          doors slide shut.

          Did someone pick it up? Colter looks up the aisle and then
          the other way into the next car. No one there.
          Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees.
          Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of
          the wall panels, only a few inches high.
          And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
          Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet
          the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.
          Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE.

</b>          Believe me, he's our guy. He

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Newark Station.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          Christina is out of her seat, debating.

<b>          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
</b>          I think you should get off.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          I'll be late for work.

<b>          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
</b>          The hell with work, Christina! You
          hate that job anyway.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy
          from somewhere.
          She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
          And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly
          disappears into the other car.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          94.

<b>          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING
</b>
          The doors stand open to the platform. Just then Derek's
          WALLET goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the
          wall panel. A second later, Colter reaches the exit area.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          All aboard. Doors are closing.

<b>          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING
</b>
          The train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform.
          Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
          Colter looks through the windows...
          And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
          strange moment between the two of them.
          Once again he's failed to save her.
          They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
          train pulls away.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          As the train SPEEDS UP, Christina sits down again, lowering
          her phone.

<b>          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
</b>          Did you get off...?

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          No. I'll call you back.
          She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test.
          But what test? Why this weird feeling?

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop New York - Penn Station.
          The train SPEEDS UP. Anxiety creeps into her face. Looking
          around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem
          ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          95.

<b>          INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
          The conductor enters. About to pour himself a cup of coffee

<b>                         WHEN --
</b>
<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Huh?
          The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED.

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING
</b>
          Inside the quiet lobby, Derek is heading for the outer doors
          to the parking lot, when:

<b>          COLTER (O.S.)
</b>          Derek Frost.
          Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You forget something?

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Gosh. Is that my wallet?
          As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM.

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Behind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of

<b>          GUZMAN VOMITING.
</b>          BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek
          inside.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          What the hell, man? What the
          hell???

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You see this?
          Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took
          off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Now you can't blow it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          96.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          What is this? Get away from me!
          The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Believe me, I'm very accurate with
          one of these things.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Jesus.
          Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a
          decent man, terrorized.
          It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
          A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman
          emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Stay there, my man.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Don't hurt me.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Stop acting, for Chrissakes.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Keep my wallet. Take my watch.
          Take anything you want.
          Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on
          the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          There. Now you have two wallets.
          Take them and go.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Shut up!
          Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Please. I have a family.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What about those other passengers?
          Don't you think they had families?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          97.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          Just what is this about?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          This man's a terrorist. He planted
          a bomb on the train.

</b>
<b>                         (HALF LAUGHS)
</b>          What?
          Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the
          barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What's the next attack? Who else
          are you going to kill today, huh?

<b>                         DEREK
</b>
<b>                         (IN TEARS)
</b>          Oh God... Oh God...
          Guzman takes a step towards Colter.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          One more step, asshole.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          Don't treat him like this. He's
          not an animal. Neither are you.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Listen to him. For God's sake I'm
          not a terrorist...!
          A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down,
          ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Piss all you want. You took eighty
          million dollars to kill hundreds of
          people today.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Eighty million dollars? I swear to
          you...

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Then what about the wallet, huh?
          Why the fuck did you twice try to
          leave your wallet on board?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          98.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>
<b>          I... I...
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Time's up! What is it?! What is
          the next attack! So help me, I'll
          put this bullet through your brain.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          I don't know what you're talking
          about!

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm going to do it.
          Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are
          streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          I would never hurt anyone. I have
          a family. I guess you'll have to
          kill me.
          But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.
          Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it?

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          You see? You are a human being.
          Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels
          like he's failed.

<b>                         GUZMAN
</b>          This can be worked out. We can
          listen to each other.
          The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Anything you want... Please...
          The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.
          Confused, he answers the phone.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Hello.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          Who is this?

<b>                         COLTER

<b>                         (STUNNED)

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          Are you the guy who was sitting
          across me on the train?
           Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE

<b>          MINUTES. 2:59... 2:58...
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          How can you be calling this number?

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          My friend had it. From when you
          called her -- to try and get me off
          the train. Who are you? What do
          you want?
          Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in
          confusion.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I was trying to warn you.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          About what?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm not sure that it matters now.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          Talk to me. I feel that something
          terrible's going to happen. Do I
          need to get off the train? Am I
          going to die?
          He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm right here, okay? Don't be
          afraid.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>
<b>                         (ANGUISH)
</b>          Why didn't I get off the train?

<b>                         (SIGHS)
</b>          I knew I should have driven in
          today. But then there's the
          bridges, right? You never know
          when they'll be jammed.
          That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What did you say?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          100.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          The bridges. You just never know
          when they'll be jammed.
          His heart starts racing.

<b>                         FLASHBACK
</b>          On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell
          phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him:

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...

<b>          BACK TO SCENE
</b>          Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          "By one o'clock, the bridge is
          going to be jammed."� That's what
          you said. You knew. You knew
          there was going to be an
          evacuation. You knew before it
          happened. All those people walking
          across the...
          The realization hits.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          They're going to bomb the bridges.
          While they're full of people.

<b>                         ON DEREK
</b>          A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a
          disturbance on a surface of deep water.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          What are you talking about. Who's
          going to --
          Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN.
          Colter presses the phone to his ear, trying to hear her.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Christina? Just hang in there.
          You'll be okay.
          A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek

<b>          TURNS THE GUN BACK INTO HIM --
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          101.
</b>
<b>          BLAM! BLAM!
</b>
<b>          DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST.
</b>          Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries
          out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and --

<b>          BLAM!
</b>
<b>          SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD.
</b>          Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A
          terrible silence.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
</b>          What's happening? Are you okay?
          Are you there?
          Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly
          evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly
          walks out.
          As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on
          his beeping WATCH --
          Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world

<b>          BLEACHES WHITE...
</b>          In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in:
          THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.
          CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The
          far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.
          We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She
          continues towards the light... and we do not follow.

<b>          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his
          seat. For long seconds we watch his face.

          A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V.

          When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other
          TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          The Army investigated Colter's
          helicopter crash in Iraq.
          Apparently he stayed behind to fly
          protective cover for a disabled
          convoy until he ran out of fuel.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          What's this, then? Some kind of
          posthumous reprimand for reckless
          flying?

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          No. It's the Silver Star.
          Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
          breezy good humor.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Send it on to his father. It'll
          ease the pain of his son's death.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I thought I might inform the
          captain of the citation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          103.
</b>
<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Better not. We can't risk
          acquainting him with the citation
          in case the memory wipe isn't
          entirely clean.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          The memory wipe?

<b>                         TECHNICIAN
</b>          I thought we were going to let him
          die.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I know, I know. But now the
          Director of National Intelligence
          is sure to want a closer look at
          our program, and until we train up
          another candidate, we'll need to
          keep Colter around to demonstrate
          it.

<b>                         TECHNICIAN
</b>          Oh.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          This thing is much bigger than any
          one of us. Goodwin, please clear
          Colter's memories and re-initialize
          Source Code.
          Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of
          disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the
          envelope.

<b>          INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY
</b>
          Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin
          takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up
          and goes to flip a switch.
          Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the
          envelope with the citation in it.

<b>          INT. ISOLATION UNIT
</b>
          Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to
          himself. The MONITOR then comes on.

          Rutledge walks by himself. Reflecting. Pleased with
          himself. Under his breath, he acknowledges the praises he's
          imagining in his head:

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Thank you, sir... I appreciate your
          faith in me... It's a great day for
          our country.

<b>          INT. ISOLATION UNIT
</b>
          Colter looks out at Goodwin. A beat of difficult silence.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          How are you feeling? Are you
          comfortable?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Just do it.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Come again?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Just do it. I knew they wouldn't
          let me die. At least you can make
          me forget all of this. I hope.
          Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What are you waiting for? You're
          just doing your job. I'd do the
          same thing if I was you. At least
          you've got a shot at saving those
          people on the bridges.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I doubt it.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You don't think they'll save them?

</b>          No. I meant, I doubt you'd be
          doing this, if you were me.
          An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Look, someone had to be where
          you're sitting, and someone had to
          be in here. Turned out it was you
          and me.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Just do it. I'm tired.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Would you like to see Christina
          again? One last time?
          Colter's not sure he heard him right.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't understand.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Seventeen minutes. That's all I
          could give you. No mission to
          fulfill. Just... the two of you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>
<b>                         (STUNNED)
</b>          Why would you do that?

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          As a favor. One prisoner to
          another.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Prisoner?

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          You were right. About me. And
          about Source Code. We've kept too
          much from each other.
          An odd sensation comes over Colter.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I usually report in at 0600. Today
          I was there early. I was there
          when the call came in. Your call.
          His call? They share a long look.

          way you could have...
          Goodwin just smiles.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>
<b>                         (PROTESTING)
</b>          How? The Source Code was a
          parallel world! You told me so!
          It's hermetically sealed. Nothing
          I did on that train would have any
          effect on this reality!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          You were on the train. I was not.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          But...

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          We didn't know if any bleed-
          throughs could occur. The
          implications would be staggering.
          That's why you were told to avoid
          unduly influencing events.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You're saying I could have saved
          those people?!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          No. Not in our world. The time
          currents are too strong. But minor
          alterations, here and there, a
          phone call, say, those might slip
          through. We didn't know for sure.
          But you proved it.
          Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I've been thinking about the things
          you said on that call. As the day
          passed, the more I understood them.
          And now, I guess we've caught up to
          each other.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Man. Just when I think I
          understand this...

          One last look at her. That's all I
          can give you. If that.

<b>                         COLTER

<b>                         GOODWIN

          about that. But, as you've
          maintained, I do not.
          The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at
          simple, grudging respect.

          Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter.
          The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake.
          Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the
          last image of his world a quiet benediction.

          contemplating his future.

          Blinking out of reverie, he goes over to a wall phone and
          punches an extension.

          He SLAMS down the phone and starts RUNNING.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter is back on the train. It is morning again, seventeen
          minutes before the destruction. He's back in the navy
          blazer. The slacks. The commuters, caught up in their
          individual concerns, ignore Colter. But he looks on them
          with an appreciation approaching joy.
          For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this
          world. Attuned to the motion of the train. The sun on his
          face. And across from him, oblivious, working away on her
          sketch pad, is Christina.
          The best sight of all.

          Colter drinks in the sight of Christina. Finally he gets up
          and walks off down the aisle.
          As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his

          Looks up at the technician. Grows more and more uneasy.
          Snapping his attention back to

          Rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card
          through the scanner. It comes up RED.

          He tries again. Red. The door stays LOCKED.

          The train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay
          shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits
          quietly at the doors.
          Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,
          together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman.

          Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching.
          As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car
          and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him,
          already pushing open the doors to the station.
          All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the
          station and sees

          Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for
          an outdoor stairwell.
          Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS.
          Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster,
          but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking.
          The train, oddly, is still sitting there.
          As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS
          appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The
          police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform.
          Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally --

          Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
          SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek
          looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one
          another through the window.

<b>                         POLICE COMMANDER
</b>          Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Of course. What's this about?
          Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
          and is DIALING IT as he turns around.
          The police approach, cautiously.

<b>                         POLICE COMMANDER

          Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone.
          On board the train there's a RINGING.

          examining the bomb.
          On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him.
          Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized.

          Colter's body -- his real body -- inside a sterile tent of
          transparent plastic. His skull has been removed. A massive
          apparatus has been infused directly onto his brain.

          The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back,
          aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.
          Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.
          Colter is dead.
          Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
          Goodwin with burning hatred.

          wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
          tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
          She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
          The bench where Colter sat is empty.
          But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
          Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
          He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
          flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.

<b>                         CHRISTINA

          Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
          speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
          But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
          Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.

<b>                         COLTER
