Mordechai Jefferson Carver, aka the Hebrew Hammer, is an orthodox Jewish stud who goes on a mission to save Hanukkah.
When Santa Claus's evil son Damian is pushed over the edge by his father's liberal policies, he does away with the Christian patriarch.
Subsequently stepping into his father's role, Damian launches a campaign to eradicate the Jewish Holiday.
The Hammer joins forces with Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, the gorgeous and dangerous daughter of the leader of the Jewish Justice League; and his brother-in-arms Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim, the head of the Kwanzaa Liberation Front, to topple Santa's evil progeny and to save Hanukkah for future generations of Jews.
