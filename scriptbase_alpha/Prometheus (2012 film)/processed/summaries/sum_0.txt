This film is set in 2093 and takes place in the same universe as the 'Alien' movies.
A group of explorers, including some archaeologists, are on an "undisclosed" mission.
They arrive at a planet millions of miles away from Earth.
The team spot what they believe to be signs of civilization.
They go to investigate and find more than just signs, they find conclusive evidence.
But some of them have an ulterior motive for being there, including the Weyland Corporation.
They believe that this is where the human race actually came from.
Things soon turn from excitement to survival once inside their discovery.
