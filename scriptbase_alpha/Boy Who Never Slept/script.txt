               INT. BASEMENT - HANDHELD SHOT - DANIEL'S POV - NIGHT

               A dingy floor, a beer bottle, a notebook of scribbles.  A 
               feeling of uneasiness.

               SLURP CHUG SPLASH

               A shaky hand sets down a beer bottle.

               THUD THUD THUD

               Someone is walking heavily down a stair case nearby.

               PAN TO - CASEY SMITH

               A regular looking guy with a soccer ball in hand and a 
               slightly exasperated expression approaches.

                                     CASEY
                         Dude what's going on, I've been 
                         looking for you for like the last 
                         ten minutes.  You're not in your 
                         room

                                     DANIEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Melissa's pregnant.  Fuck man, what 
                         the fuck am I going to do?
                              (pacing back and forth 
                              nervously)

                                     CASEY
                         Man, are you sure she's pregnant

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Stuff is strewn about and a small untidy room.  The walls 
               are bare except for a few decorations and blue bottles on 
               the window sill.

               DANIEL WESTON

               23 years old, slightly unshaven, attractive, sitting on a 
               bed in his room. His left hand grasps a notebook with blank 
               pages. His right hand firmly clutches a plain ballpoint pen.

               PEN TIP

               touches the paper. He pauses.  He writes "the" and lets out 
               a barley audible sigh. He stares at the blank pages and starts 
               to write again.

               INSERT - NOTEBOOK

               Written in barley readable handwriting.  "The moonlight shone 
               wildly in the man's eyes on this lonely night."

               BACK TO SCENE

               DANIEL

               Stands up and takes his over shirt off, revealing a strong, 
               lean physique.

               He picks up the notebook, puts the pen in his mouth and paces 
               back and forth in his cramped room.

               TAP TAP TAP

               fingers beat against the notebook.  He's eyes look up at the 
               ceiling, he's lost in thought.

               Daniel drops to the ground, look up, grunts.  Daniel's body 
               furiously moves up and down.  He's doing pushups.

               He continues, he strains, the veins in his arms bulge.  His 
               face is serious and his pace slows to a... stop.  His hands 
               shake.

               DANIEL RISES

               INT. COMMON AREA - NIGHT

               A dark rundown room with a big screen TV and worn out couch.  
               Casey relaxes on the couch with a beer in his hand. His eyes 
               are glued to the television screen.

               The flickering glow of the television set interrupts the 
               darkness of the room.

               Daniel enters the room wearing the same clothing as in the 
               previous scene.

                                     CASEY
                              (looking up at Daniel)
                         Hey-what are you up to?

               Comedian on Television set (O.S.) is in the middle of a 
               satirical stand up routine.  His jokes and laugh track 
               interrupt the dialogue between Daniel and Casey.

                                     DANIEL
                         Not much.

                                     CASEY
                         Want a beer?

                                     DANIEL
                         Hell yeah.

                         You got it.

               Casey throws Daniel a beer from a half empty case sitting at 
               foot of the couch.

               Daniel opens it, sits down, and drinks heavily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Casey laughs crazily.  Daniel drinks more beer.

               INT. COMMON AREAS - COUCH - DANIEL AND CASEY - NIGHT

               Daniel is on the couch.  Multiple beer cans are sloppily 
               near him.

                                     CASEY
                         Holy shit you sucked those fuckers 
                         down!

                         Hell yeah, looking for some 
                         inspiration.

                         From the inner part of my psyche.

                         Tonight, Sci-fi garbage

               Casey laughs and turns his attention to the TV,.  Daniel 
               joins him.

                                                                       CUT:

               Casey is asleep on the couch. TV is still on. Daniel puts 
               away a few beer cans and then turns the TV off.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         The end of yet another day in dreary 
                         Eugene.  10 beers, bad TV, no ideas.  
                         With Casey asleep I'll have only the 
                         phosphorus glow of my monitor, the 
                         click of the keyboard, and the 
                         voiceless online chatter to keep me 
                         company

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               His eyes are a hazy and mildly blood shot.  He gets on his 
               COMPUTER.  He stares at an older laptop.  His fingers pound 
               the keys.

                                     DANIEL WESTON (V.O.)

                         What do you look like? What kind of 
                         a question is that to start things

               Daniel's words appear on the screen as he types them.

               INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Melissa's tossing back and forth.  She sits up quickly and 
               opens her eyes, awakened from a NIGHTMARE.

               CLOSEUP - MELISSA'S FACE

               She turns on the light, rubs her eyes and reaches for her 
               computer, yawning.

               MELISSA'S POV

               She presses the button on her computer and it comes on.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Melissa fixes her hair with a headband and stares intently 
               at the computer screen.

               And cut between Melissa and her computer monitor.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               He's at the computer typing.

               And cut between Daniel and the computer monitor.

                         Yeah, it does.

               She smiles knowingly.

                         I'm a little shaky at the moment 
                         'cause I just woke up.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Shaky...shaky? Why Shaky from waking

                         I had a crazy nightmare.

               She rubs her eyes as she reads Daniel's words.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         I'm sorry. What was it about?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         It's sort of fuzzy, but what I 
                         remember is that it was pitch black, 
                         and...

                         I'm not much for modern poetry, but 
                         give me Yeats and I'm pretty happy.

                         Yeah, modern poetry kind of sucks.  
                         Its either way to sappy or way too

                         dies in his wife's arms, but he isn't 
                         sad he's happy and says that he 
                         finally found Harmony in his life. 
                         Which is also her name and the name 
                         of book he wrote.

                         That's awesome. Can you send me the 
                         draft? I'd love to read it.  You've 
                         got me all interested.

               CLOSEUP - DANIEL'S FACE

               Looks like he's thinking about something really hard.

                         16/F/ Portland does that matter?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                              (beat)
                         Of course not; we're just talking.  
                         I like talking to you.

               She smiles sweetly to herself, as if pleased.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Thanks, I like talking to you too.

                                                                   FADE TO:

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         It's six. We stayed up all night.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Oh my God, are you joking?

               She smiles ruefully.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Don't you have classes soon?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Yes! At seven! And a student council 
                         meeting! I'm going to be a wreck!

               Melissa sits back, smiling.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Well, I would say good night, but 
                         that would be pointless.

               She shuts her computer, looking up thoughtfully at the 
               ceiling.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

               Daniel closes his laptop. Melissa's goodbye lingers in his 
               head.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Good day, then?

               He leaps onto his bed and laughs.

               CLOSEUP - DANIEL

               He's gazing at the ceiling, smiling contentedly.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Daniel walks down a long dismal hallway lined with doors on 
               each side.  Feeling of dreamyness.

               INT. COMMON AREAS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

               A low lit game room with a pool table and dying plants as 
               decorations.

               CRACK

               Casey blasts his cue on a group of pool balls sending them 
               bouncing off the railing.

               Daniel enters.

                                     CASEY
                              (noticing Daniel)
                         Look who's back from the dead?

               Daniel looks tired and slightly anxious, but still happy.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeaaaaaaaaaah

               Daniel picks up a nearby pool cue.

                                     DANIEL
                         You're up early.

                                     CASEY
                         Yeah, got work in an hour.

                                     DANIEL
                         That sucks

                                     CASEY
                         Yeah... You going to Lauren's party 
                         this week.

                                     DANIEL
                         Um.. Is it going to be a sausage 
                         fest?

                                     CASEY
                         Oh probably, No dude she's bringing 
                         the entire volley ball team.  Yeah, 
                         You know Amy the blonde with the big 
                         rack... I'm going

                                     DANIEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Is it going to be a kegger what kinda 
                         party is it?

                                     CASEY
                         No! it's social class.  You get to 
                         be part of the aristocracy.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh, is there going to be like classy 
                         chicks all dressed up in dresses and 
                         stuff

                                     CASEY
                         Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

               Casey bring the pool stick to his crotch and motions with 
               his hips.

                                     CASEY
                              (humorous voice)
                         Maybe get some poontang.

               Daniel laughs and continues to play pool.

                                     DANIEL
                         You're a freak man.

                                                                   FADE TO:

                                     CASEY
                         So how's that literary masterpiece 
                         coming along?

                                     DANIEL
                         How do you think?  It's not.  I've 
                         been going through some writer's 
                         block.

                                     CASEY
                         Writer's block? So what do you do at 
                         night when you can't sleep.

               Casey motions with his hand like his jacking off.

                                     DANIEL
                         I.. Uh.. work out

                                     CASEY
                         Oh, right on. Work out.  That's why 
                         your right arm is better then your 
                         left I take it. Casey motions again 
                         with his hand.

                                     DANIEL
                         Hey, That's a

                                     CASEY
                         Hey, someone brought it to my 
                         attention it wasn't me.

                                     DANIEL
                              (jokingly again)
                         That's a conq.

               Daniel looks at the pool table and then at Casey again.  He 
               turns slightly more serious.

                                     DANIEL
                         So anyways I've been talking to some 
                         chick, dude, online.  She's hot.

                                     CASEY
                         What?

                                     DANIEL
                         Some chick dude, she's hot

                                     CASEY
                              (seriously)
                         Where did you meet her?

                         Online

               Daniel hits a ball in slowly.  He looks up and smiles in 
               anticipation of the joke.

                                     CASEY
                         Dude, she's fat.

                                     DANIEL
                         How do you know?

                                     CASEY
                         All online chicks are heffers, Shalom!

                                     DANIEL
                         She's hot

                                     CASEY
                              (prying)
                         Oh, so you've seen her?

                                     DANIEL
                         I will.

                                     CASEY
                         Have you seen her

                                     DANIEL
                         I will.

                                     CASEY
                         Oh so I see you haven't, you're going 
                         whalin budy.  That's right.

               Casey hold the pool stick up like a javelin.

                                     CASEY
                         Man the harpoon.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Daniel sits in front of his bed.  Tape recorder in hand.

               he hits the record button.

                              recorder)
                         Hello, this is Daniel Weston's stream 
                         of consciousness.  Yet another attempt 
                         at writing something that doesn't 
                         lick balls

               Daniel gets up and walks over to his desk. He turns on a 
               STEREO and some UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS.

                                     DANIEL
                         There is an endless array of grass.  
                         Bright green, lush and calming.  The 
                         sun is high, the sky a perfect shade 
                         of blue oblivion.  A group of people 
                         are in a herd, all banded together 
                         wearing tattered clothing.  Their 
                         eyes are wide open, gazes held at 
                         fixed at points in the distance.  
                         Their hair is torn by wind that's no 
                         longer present.  There is a path of 
                         pure granite cutting through the 
                         endless grass.  These people are 
                         together walking.  Slowly, staggering, 
                         but always walking, they are searching 
                         for the end. The end is what they 
                         seek...
                              (pause)
                         crap, pure crap.

               CLICK

               He presses stop on the recorder, puts it down

               EXT. COLLEGE TOWN STREETS - LATER ON - NIGHT

               Typical university housing street, with low cost houses, 
               apartments, and signs of young people.  Daniel is standing 
               outside his apartment building wearing headphones.

               SLOW ZOOM ON DANIEL

               He walks in a direction-less wonder gazing randomly at the 
               empty streets and buildings.  He looks lost.

               Daniel crosses an empty street, he's lit by the glow of the 
               many street lights.

               He pauses and stares into the night's sky.

               CLOSEUP - DANIEL

               He looks up and stares hard at a full moon

               Daniel walks away and disappears into the darkness of a empty 
               street.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Daniel takes a swing off an a energy drink.  His eyes are 
               fixed on his computer.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Hi, how have you been?

                         Good.  A little tired in school, 
                         though.

               INTERCUT instant messaging conversation.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         So what part of the high school caste 
                         system are you in?  I bet you're 
                         popular...

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Um... kinda. I mean, I know a lot of 
                         people.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         That's awesome.  I was a bit of a

                         Why's that?  You seem really nice.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Please don't say that

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Why not?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Because girls don't like nice guys.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         I do.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Really?  Well, who are you dating?  
                         A big football jock?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         No... I'm not dating anybody. What 
                         about you?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         No, I'm still waiting for someone to 
                         blow me away.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Do you have a picture of yourself?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         I have a digital camera.  I could 
                         take one right now.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Cool

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Do you have a pic?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Yes, and I'll send it after I get 
                         yours.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Okay... give me a sec.
                              (muttering to himself)
                         Picture picture picture...

               He pulls out his digital camera and turns it on.

               He makes funny faces taking pictures and trying to be sexy, 
               pulling his sleeve up. Daniel takes a few pictures. Chooses 
               one.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         OK... Here it is.

               Daniel nervously presses the send button and waits.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                              (surprised)
                         Oh My God, you look so young!

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Greeaat!

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         No you're cute, really cute.  And so 
                         buff.  Do you work out a lot?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Thanks.  I do a lot of of pushups, 
                         sit-ups and handstand presses.  At 
                         night when I can't sleep.  I also do 
                         martial arts.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         You're so cute.

                                     DANIEL WESTON (V.O.)
                         I prefer sexy.

                                     MELISSA JONES (V.O.)
                         Very sexy.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Now send me your pic
                              (typing, muttering to 
                              himself)
                         Please don't be a heifer... please 
                         don't be a heifer.

               A picture pops up on the screen.  Daniel just stares. He is 
               so taken in he doesn't speak right away.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         That bad huh?

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         No.. You're beautiful, completely 
                         beautiful.  You have the most 
                         beautiful intense eyes I've ever 
                         seen.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         You're just saying that.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         I don't do that. I'm serious...

                                                                   FADE TO:

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Melissa, do you like chest hair?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         What kind of a question is that?  I 
                         swear you're the king of random.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         I don't know... I have some and was 
                         wondering what you thought.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Um, I don't particularly like it, 
                         but it's OK.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         OK

               Daniel smiles.

               Melissa closes her computer and looks up.  She's happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A shared kitchen area with two large microwaves.

               Daniel takes a container of wax and puts it in one of the 
               microwaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. APARTMENT SHARED BATHROOMS - NIGHT

               CLOSEUP - DANIEL'S HANDS

               Daniel uses a small stick to mix a container of thick gooey 
               wax.

               Daniel takes off his shirt, revealing a thin muscular body 
               with thick black chest hair.

               He takes a strip of paper and applies the wax mixture to it.

               He presses some paper strips up against his chest and they 
               stick to it.

               He puts them on until they cover up his entire chest.  He 
               grabs one corner of the first strip with his fingers. He 
               breathes in and out deeply.

                                     DANIEL
                         Okay one... two...

               Daniel rips off the strip taking all the hair on his chest 
               with it.

                                     DANIEL WESTON
                         Aaarrrggghhhhhhhh!

               CASEY enters nonchalantly to use the bathroom.

                                     CASEY
                         What the fuck?

                                     DANIEL
                              (embarrassed)
                         Don't ask man.

                                     CASEY
                         You're crazy man

               Daniel RIPS another strip off his chest.  He SCREAMS in pain 
               and then LAUGHS as if he can't believe what he's doing.

               RIP Daniel slowly pulls off another strip.  His irritated 
               chest is spotted with hairy and non hairy regions.

               Daniel looks at Casey and breaks into LAUGHTER.

                                     DANIEL
                              (Turning to look at 
                              Casey)
                         Things you do for chicks, huh?

                                     CASEY
                              (Using the urinal)
                         Ah that's great... that's classic, 
                         props to you; I couldn't do it.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm bleeding. Check it out.

               Daniel points to a red spot on his chest

                                     CASEY
                         I'd just shave it

                                     DANIEL
                              (relieved laughter)
                         Ok. Oh god...

               INSERT - WAX STRIP

               Wax strip with clumps of hair from Daniel's chest.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

               Melissa, wearing a backpack and regular school clothes, walks 
               home from high school.

               ZOOM ON - MELISSA

               She walks across a bridge and messes with her hair.

               INT. MELISSA JONE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The bedroom is light and feminine.

               Melissa is talking to a friend.  She's wearing sexy and cute 
               school clothes.  She is on her cell phone.

               She takes down a hanging mirror and is attempting to see how 
               her new jeans look.

                                     MELISSA
                         Uh huh... I hope so... no, I missed 
                         practice today 'cause I wasn't feeling 
                         well... Yeah... I don't know though. 
                         Should I wear those new jeans I got?

               She looks around for a place to set the mirror. She holds 
               the mirror behind her again to try and see her butt. She's 
               obviously distracted.

                                     MELISSA
                         I think they make my ass look totally 
                         hot... uh huh... trying to see it.

               She sets the mirror down on the chair, still attempting to 
               get a good view.

                                     MELISSA
                         So anyway, are you going to the 
                         football game this Saturday? Is Jason 
                         is going to be there?  Yeah, I love 
                         them. Oh yeah, I'm totally going to 
                         wear them... yes, you should 
                         definitely wear the skirt... no, the 
                         skirt looks totally cute... yeah.

               Turns yet again to try and see her rear. She is still 
               distracted.

                                     MELISSA
                         Hmm... no... forget it... but just 
                         take my word on it... mhmm.

               She struggles a bit with the mirror. Her parents are arguing 
               in the other room. MR. JONES is shouting something at MRS. 
               JONES.  Their words are muffled.

                                     MELISSA
                              (Sighing)
                         Oh god, I can hear my parents going 
                         at it yet again. They never stop.  
                         Yeah, I've gotta go... k, bye.

               Melissa walks to the wall to replace the mirror. She has 
               problems getting it straight.

               She walks to her bed, puts her hair up and sits on the bed 
               to do her homework. She looks bored and goes to the book 
               shelf; she grabs a book, lays down, and begins to read.

               CLOSEUP - BOOK

               The picture of a dragon hints at a Fantasy book.

               INT. COMMONS - DANIEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

               The room is encased in darkness.

               Suddenly an ALARM BEEPS.

               Daniel MOANS and SLAPS the alarm clock. It BEEPS faster and 
               LOUDER.

               Daniel grunts, SMACKS it again, and the lights comes on to 
               reveal Daniel's back. He is in boxers. He puts on a Gadget 
               City uniform and tries opening his eyes really wide, but 
               they continue to shut.

               INT - COMMONS - TRACKING SHOT - HALLWAY

               Daniel steps into the hallway and pauses to smack himself on 
               the cheek. He walks down the hall.

               INT. COMMONS - STAIRWELL

               Daniel clomps down the stairs to the exit door.

                                     DANIEL
                              (in a mocking voice)

                         What are you going to do when this 
                         breaks?  I think you should really 
                         go with our extended warranty.  Yes 
                         you definitely should.  Are you sure?  
                         Nope, I'm sorry I can't just ring 
                         this up for you until I fully present 
                         the warranty.  I really think you 
                         need it.  Sir, come back. Please 
                         (laughing at himself)  I fucking 
                         hate selling extended warranties.

               Melissa is dressed in normal school clothes. Her friend 
               CLARISSA, a slightly preppy teenage girl, is sitting next to 
               her. They're doing homework.

                                     MELISSA
                         What are you wearing for Jason's 
                         Halloween party?

                                     CLARISSA
                         I don't know. I'm thinking of going 
                         as Catwoman.  Do you think I could 
                         pull it off?

                                     MELISSA
                         Absolutely, it would be awesome. We 
                         could get soem black hair dye, maybe 
                         some leather pants...

                                     CLARISSA
                         I don't know, Amy might copy me.  
                         She's been being such a bitch lately.

                                     MELISSA
                         God, I know! She's really a nice 
                         girl, but she's just so selfish. I 
                         don't know what it is, but she has 
                         some weird kind of competition thing 
                         with you.

                                     CLARISSA
                         Me neither...

                                     MELISSA
                         But so what if she copies you; you'll 
                         look better in it anyway.

               They giggle and continue with their homework.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               The girls playing on the bed and tickling each other. They 
               are laughing as Melissa hugs Clarissa. Its obvious they're 
               best friends.

                                     MELISSA
                              (Calming down)
                         Um... ok. I have a question... do 
                         you think 23 is too old?

                                     CLARISSA
                         Too old for what?

                                     MELISSA
                         Don't freak out on me, OK?

               Clarissa nods with a curious expression on her face.

                                     MELISSA
                         Well, I met this guy online, his 
                         name is Daniel and he's really 
                         awesome.  He's sweet, and wonderful, 
                         and he's just so amazing.

               Clarissa listens patiently.

                                     MELISSA
                              (Taking a deep breath)
                         The only problem is that he's twenty-
                         three.

                                     CLARISSA
                         You met him online?  I don't know... 
                         that's kind of risky. I mean, what 
                         if he's some kind of psycho or 
                         deranged lunatic?

                                     MELISSA
                              (Eagerly)
                         No, he's not, he's not, he's totally 
                         not!

                                     CLARISSA
                         How do you know?

                                     MELISSA
                         I can just tell; we connect. When 
                         I'm talking to him I just feel so 
                         comfortable. He's sweet, and nice, 
                         and romantic... he feels like my 
                         soulmate or something.

                                     CLARISSA
                         That's cool I guess. It's still weird 
                         though. What does he look like? Is 
                         he hot?

                                     MELISSA
                         Very...

                                     CLARISSA
                         Let me see... oho, you're right.
                              (Teasingly)
                         Age might not matter.

                                     MELISSA
                              (giggling)
                         You really think so?

               SLOW ZOOM ON MELISSA

               She's sitting in a chair typing. She's wearing a blouse and 
               underwear. She has a blanket wrapped around her and is intent 
               on the computer screen.

               And cut between Melissa and Daniel.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME

               Daniel is sitting at his computer typing. He's smiling and 
               looks like he recently finished working out.

               And cut between Daniel and the computer screen

               INTERCUT instant message conversation between Daniel and 
               Melissa.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Hey, I missed you.  How's your mom?

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Doing better.  She's been fighting a 
                         lot less with my dad.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         That's good.  Hopefully it will last.  
                         My parents used to fight like crazy 
                         and they are always at each other's 
                         throats.  I never want to be like 
                         that... I wrote you something.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         No one's ever done anything like 
                         that for me before.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         You're worth it. Okay, here it is.  
                         Ode to Melissa

               CLOSEUP - MELISSA'S FACE

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                              (Wonderingly)
                         Ode to Melissa I greet the fly that 
                         lands on my bed I try to find words 
                         worthy of your presence.

               She's very moved as she reads the poem.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         Outside, you lurk with nervous feline 
                         eyes.  Day yawns to night, Trees 
                         become dark bodies -- Giant shadow 
                         puppets of street lamp Halos.

               She grabs her webcam and begins to hook it up to her computer.

               Daniel looks more and more surprised as he watches his 
               computer screen. Melissa's voice continues to read the poem.

                                     DANIEL
                              (Reading off screen)
                         Accept webcam... YES!

                                     MELISSA (CONT. V.O.)
                         Eyes close to the warmth of dreams 
                         Green dreams of happy tomorrows, And 
                         you busy, calm, watchful night You 
                         are the cool darkness between Days.  
                         The molecules of time sleep, Their 
                         quiet undulations Across your starry 
                         hands

               DANIEL'S POV

               He's watching Melissa steady a green webcam.

                                     MELISSA
                         As I lie and watch your naked skin 
                         Bathed by moonlight. Oh... wow.

               The webcam stops shaking.

                                     MELISSA (V.O.)
                         I have a surprise for you.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                              (Reading the screen)
                         Accept webcam request
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

               Daniel leans forward. Melissa rises and slowly begins to 
               unbutton her shirt. Daniel's eyes open wider as she continues 
               to unbutton her shirt slowly.

               DANIEL LEANS BACK IN HIS CHAIR

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Ahhh...

               Melissa opens the shirt completely.  She looks into the camera 
               as if looking directly at Daniel.

               She slowly undoes her bra and lets it open slightly.  Her 
               perfect, perky breasts are exposed for a few seconds.

               Daniel is typing rapidly.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         I want to call you.

               Daniel is flushed with emotion.  He calls her and her PHONE 
               RINGS.

               Melissa pulls her shirt closed again and grabs her RINGING 
               CELL PHONE. She puts it to her ear.

               INTERCUT phone call between Melissa and Daniel.

                                     MELISSA
                         Hi.

                                     DANIEL
                         How are you doing?

                                     MELISSA
                         Great.

                                                                   FADE TO:

                         You should tell your dad how you 
                         feel.

                                     MELISSA
                         You think he'll actually understand?

                                     DANIEL
                         No, but at least it's a good start.

                                                                   FADE TO:

                         I could just tell.

                                                                   FADE TO:

                         I'd want to feel a cool breeze on a 
                         high mountain lake sitting near a 
                         bonfire, looking at the stars... 
                         that's where I'd like to be.

                         Oho... that sounds nice... but I 
                         would want some marshmallows.

                              (Smiling)

               Daniel picks up a notebook and begins to write feverishly.

               LOUDLY KNOCKS on the door.  He takes a large swig from one 
               of the beers he's holding. No answer. He knocks again.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

               Daniel, looking very tired, stumbles to the door and opens 
               it. He sees Casey standing there grinning.

                                     CASEY
                         Just get up?

                                     DANIEL WESTON
                              (very sleepy)
                         Um.. Yeah.

                                     CASEY
                              (Handing Daniel a 
                              beer)
                         Time for some pre-party beer action.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh yeah?

               Daniel takes the beer and sluggishly takes a drink.

               Casey takes a seat on Daniel's bed and looks around.  He 
               picks up a shirt lying somewhere.

                                     CASEY
                              (throwing the shirt 
                              at Daniel)
                         It's Friday night, it's going to be 
                         rockin,' lets go.
                              (Jokingly)
                         Come on twinkletoes -- come on

               INT. CASEY'S ROOM - DAY

               Daniel and Casey both have beers in their hands and are 
               sitting across from each other with a chess set between them.  
               They are both in a very happy mood.

                                     DANIEL
                         I can't believe you got me to drink 
                         Steel Piss Tap

                                     CASEY
                         Aw, it's good for you dude.

               Daniel and Casey clink their beers as they share a cheer.

                                     CASEY
                         It puts the lead in your pencil.

               Daniel laughs and takes another swig.

                                     CASEY
                         So how's that Melissa thing going?

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't know... well, Melissa's great, 
                         beautiful, sweet, nice...

                                     CASEY
                         Then what's the problem?

               Daniel picks up a chess piece and moves it.

                                     DANIEL
                         She's sixteen... check!

                                     CASEY
                              (negative sigh)
                         Oh.

                                     DANIEL
                         Don't tell me you haven't thought 
                         about being with a younger chick 
                         dude.  I know  you.  Casey, Casey 
                         Smith on the prowl.

                                     CASEY
                              (laughing)
                         That's something, ah... sixteen?  
                         That's pretty young. That's something 
                         that, you know, you think about and 
                         you talk about, but you don't actually 
                         do.  Like banging your step mom.

               Casey moves a chess piece confidently.

                                     DANIEL
                              (surprised)
                         You banged your step mom?

                                     CASEY
                              (rolling his eyes)
                         Nevermind, dude.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh man.

                                     CASEY
                         Dude, I was joking. Snarfer.

               Daniel moves a piece and puts CASEY'S king in check.

                                     DANIEL
                         Check.

                                     CASEY
                         Ahhhhhh, shit.

                                     DANIEL
                              (quietly)
                         Sarah's going to be back in town 
                         this month.

                                     CASEY
                         Yeah? You two still talk?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, we managed to stay friends.

                                     CASEY
                         Are you still in love with her?

                                     DANIEL
                         No.

                                     CASEY
                         That's good at least.

               Daniel moves another piece and puts CASEY in check again.

                                     DANIEL
                         Check.

                                     CASEY
                         Damn... Shit ... I'm never playing 
                         this game again.  Why do I suck so 
                         bad?  It's the beer.

                                     DANIEL
                         Is this party going to be any good?  
                         What's the back up plan?  Walking up 
                         and down University Street, smashed, 
                         causing havoc?.

                                     CASEY
                              (grinning)
                         Actually, that is the backup plan.

               INT. RANDOM PARTY - NIGHT

               Daniel sits on a couch, looking dazed and drunk. His eyes 
               move slowly back and forth, and he looks totally out of it.  
               He's holding a cell phone to his ear and wears and expectant 
               expression.

               INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Melissa is sleeping. RING RING. She wakes up, dazed, fumbling 
               for her cell phone.  She looks at the caller ID. She answers 
               in a SLEEPY VOICE.

                                     MELISSA
                         Hello?

                              (Slurring)
                         Hey Melissaaa... this is Daniel... 
                         I'm bleeding inside... I wanted to 
                         tell you... I need you.

                                     MELISSA
                              (Concerned)
                         Are you okay?  Where are you at?

                                     DANIEL
                         Melissa... I love you. I want to 
                         hold you... and fuck you... and tell 
                         you I love you...

                              (Annoyed)
                         You're drunk.  You need to get home 
                         and go to sleep.

                                     DANIEL
                         No I wanted to tell you... and I 
                         want to be with you... you're perfect.  
                         I want to see you...

                                     MELISSA
                              (A little desperately)
                         Please, just try and get home safe.  
                         We can talk tomorrow when you're 
                         sober.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm serious... I love you, I want to 
                         be with you... will you marry me?

                                     MELISSA
                              (Now angry)
                         Daniel, its 4:30 am. Call me when 
                         you're sober.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm serious... will you marry me?

                                     MELISSA
                              (Angry and annoyed)
                         Good bye, Daniel.
                              (hangs up)

               Melissa hangs up and curls in a ball with her hands over her 
               face.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - MORNING

               Daniel is still wearing his clothes.  He rolls back and forth.  
               He opens his eyes, looking dazed and extremely hung over.

               There is vomit on his chin, cheeks, and the front of his 
               shirt. He looks nauseous.

               Daniel slowly stands up.  He looks as if he could collapse 
               at any minute. He walks out of his room.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               Daniel sits down on the couch. COLLEGE STUDENT #1 is watching 
               TV.

                                     COLLEGE STUDENT #1
                         Hey.  Are you alright?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah.  I drank way too much last 
                         night.

               COLLEGE STUDENT #2 enters. She gives Daniel a funny look.

                                     COLLEGE STUDENT #2
                         Man. You don't look so good.

               CASEY enters and looks at Daniel.

                         Dude... you look like shit.

                         Thanks.

               Daniel is showering. IT is hot and steam starts to fill the

                                     DANIEL
                         Ow! Hot hot hot... damn it.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Daniel is lying on his bed again.

               He is holding his phone and looking through the calls to see 
               who he called while in his drunken stupor.

               INSERT cell phone screen showing "Melissa."

               He groans and puts his head in his hands.

                         Hi... this is Daniel. How are you?

                         I'm OK.

                         I'm sorry about last night. I was 
                         really drunk.  I spent all day lying 
                         in bed dry heaving.

                                     MELISSA
                         Why did you do that to yourself?  Do 
                         you even remember all the stuff you 
                         told me on the phone last night?

                         Not really.  I was feeling lonely.  
                         I'm sorry for waking you up last 
                         night to talk to a drunken idiot.

                         It's not OK, but I'm fine.

                         I still want to meet you though.

                         It's been two weeks since my drunken 
                         exuberance.  Sarah my ex finance is 
                         back to walk over me yet again. When 
                         asked about my love life I mentioned 
                         Melissa.  Of course I changed her 
                         age to 19.  I feel like the proverbial 
                         loner, mentioning a girl I've never 
                         met.

                         Why are you still here?  You graduated 
                         two years ago.  Shouldn't you be 
                         moving on?

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't know.  I guess I'm just 
                         waiting for some inspiration. To 
                         come out and be like... Here I am 
                         world Daniel Weston.  I'm waiting to 
                         write my masterpiece.

                                     SARAH
                         Don't wait too long.  So how was 
                         your weekend?  Did you go out?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah and I got hit on by some older 
                         chicks.

                                     SARAH
                         Is that good?

                                     DANIEL
                         It's not good or bad, they just drank 
                         a little too much and couldn't help 
                         themselves.

                                     SARAH
                         Ahh. Okay.

                                     DANIEL
                         Probably thought that if I got drunk 
                         enough I'd take them home... kinda 
                         sad actually.

                                     SARAH
                         I'm sure.  So nothing came of that?

                                     DANIEL
                         Um...not exactly my type. Yeah, there 
                         were no girls for me; no one that 
                         was interesting at least.

                                     SARAH
                         Interesting enough to what?

                                     DANIEL
                         To date.  I want to be blown away, 
                         but I haven't met a girl yet who's 
                         done that to me.  Maybe it's not 
                         even possible.  I mean, I've loved 
                         girls, but I haven't been blown away 
                         by them.

                                     SARAH
                         Um... thanks.

                                     DANIEL
                         I didn't mean it like that.

                                     SARAH
                         Yes you did.  But that's okay. You 
                         can care about someone, even love 
                         them, and not be 'in' love with them 
                         or 'blown away.'

                                     DANIEL
                         I could be in love with Melissa like 
                         that, but I'd have to see her in 
                         person to really know.  Ah fuck it... 
                         I'll just stick to working a lot, 
                         and going out by myself.

                                     SARAH
                         Right. Anyway, it would be hard to 
                         know what your feelings really are 
                         without spending time in the flesh.

                                     DANIEL
                              (teasingly)
                         It's all about the flesh

                                     SARAH
                         Mmmm.  Apparently it's not, because 
                         as you say, you have no problem with 
                         that area.

                                     DANIEL
                         I was kidding. Sex is easy, but sex 
                         with passion and meaning... yeah... 
                         that's the good stuff. Anyway... at 
                         least part of you still has to find 
                         some strange, unexplainable attraction 
                         to the directionless writer still 
                         searching for that special thought.

                                     SARAH
                         Maybe, but only a little part.

                                     DANIEL
                              (awkward silence)
                         I know.  So how are you and your 
                         husband doing?

                                     SARAH
                         We're fine.

                                     DANIEL
                         You look really happy together.

                                     SARAH
                         Thanks, we are. Stop trying to change 
                         the subject. Why haven't you met 
                         Melissa yet?

                                     DANIEL
                         She says she's not ready to meet me 
                         yet and that she feels pressured.

                                     SARAH
                         That's odd... don't you guys talk 
                         all the time?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, but remember she's only si-, 
                         ah, 19, and I kinda called her drunk 
                         awhile ago and said some things.

                                     SARAH
                         What things?

                                     DANIEL
                         It's embarrassing. I asked her to 
                         marry me, told her I loved her, and, 
                         well, you know...

                                     SARAH
                         No wonder she doesn't want to meet 
                         you right away.

                                     DANIEL
                         Maybe I should stop talking to her, 
                         tell her I don't want to do the wrong 
                         thing and mess her life up.

                                     SARAH
                         Right.  Then you'll start drinking 
                         and call her and all this shit will 
                         come out and you won't even remember 
                         what you said to her.

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't do that anymore.

                                     SARAH
                         Yeah. Famous last words, Daniel.

                                     DANIEL
                         I promised I'd stop...

                                     SARAH
                         Promised who? You even used to call 
                         me drunk.

                                     DANIEL
                         What?!

                                     SARAH
                         You used call me and beg me to live 
                         with you, kiss you..., all that stuff.

                                     DANIEL
                              (embarrassed)
                         Ahhh, you never told me all that 
                         before. I'm sorry about that...

                                     SARAH
                         If I had a boyfriend who was doing 
                         that. You have a habit of doing this 
                         and not just in isolated incidents.

                                     DANIEL
                         So what would you recommend?

                                     SARAH
                         No more whacked out phone calls, 
                         obviously. And honestly, I would 
                         want to meet her in person, to try 
                         and see if your feelings are real 
                         and if she feels the same. You'll 
                         gain a much clearer and accurate 
                         idea of the situation and the type 
                         of relationship that may exist between 
                         the two of you, in the real world, 
                         not virtual land.  Now, there is a 
                         huge risk in that, because what if 
                         they are real and she still doesn't 
                         feel the same for you?  It will hurt 
                         like a bitch, but at least you'll 
                         know, and you can stop putting 
                         yourself out there.  Even though 
                         that's a worst case scenario, there 
                         is a positive side to it, because 
                         you will definitely get closure either 
                         way.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well she doesn't want to meet me 
                         yet. She's all fucked up.

                                     SARAH
                         I think she does; she's just nervous. 
                         Just explain it to her the way I've 
                         explained it to you. If she really 
                         cares about you as a true friend, 
                         and not some trophy who is infatuated 
                         with her, then she'll want to do 
                         whatever she can to help salvage the 
                         friendship while still respecting 
                         your honest feelings for her.

                                     DANIEL
                         Okay, I guess I'll do what I 
                         originally wanted and take her out.

                                     SARAH
                         Okay, let's get your terminology 
                         right first.  You won't be "taking 
                         her out" you'll be "meeting" her.  
                         It's the difference between sounding 
                         sleazy and sounding decent.  Those 
                         are the little things that freak 
                         girls out.

                                     DANIEL
                         All right, we'll see what happens. 
                         Thank you, though, I appreciate you 
                         your advice on this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Daniel and Sarah are getting ready ready to leave.

                                     SARAH
                         My husband's waiting for me, but 
                         it's been fun catching up with you, 
                         and I'm sure we'll see each other 
                         around.
                              (teasingly)
                         Since you're here.

                                     DANIEL
                              (ruefully)
                         Thank you for that.

                                     SARAH
                              (smiling)
                         No problem.

               Daniel sets some money on the table.

                                     DANIEL
                         There it is. Anyways, it's been fun 
                         hanging out with you.

                                     SARAH
                         You too.

               They hug.

                                     DANIEL
                         Have a good night

                                     SARAH
                         Yeah, you too, good bye.

               Sarah walks away and Daniel sits there alone for awhile, 
               thinking. He looks a little pathetic.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER

               INT. COMMONS - DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

               Daniel rummages through the clothes in his closet. He throws 
               a bunch of selections on his bed. He's trying on outfits in 
               his mirror.

                                     DANIEL
                         Too old. Fuck it.

               He changes to a plain shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         Too boring.

               He changes to a sleek black shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         Too smooth.

               He changes to a wife beater.

                                     DANIEL
                         Right.

               He changes to another nondescript shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         Too bland.

               He takes his shirt off and puts on a backwards baseball cap, 
               smiling.

                                     DANIEL
                         Too young.

               He pitches his voice higher.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm Daniel Weston. How you doin.'

               He laughs at himself and throws the cap off. He puts on a 
               bright yellow shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         No.

               Changes into a blue button-up shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         Closer, but not quite right.

               He changes to a casual white button-up shirt.

                                     DANIEL
                         Perfect.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Daniel is running to his car.  In his excitement he trips 
               and almost falls to the ground.

               EXT. PARK - TRACKING SHOT - MELISSA WALKING - DAY

               It's a beautiful day.  Melissa walks along a park path, She's 
               in a white sweatshirt and jeans, carrying her school bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Daniel walking towards Melissa. She is sitting on a park 
               bench, watching him approach.

                                     DANIEL
                         Melissa?

                                     MELISSA
                              (shyly)
                         Hey.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm Daniel... well, ah --

                                     MELISSA
                         Nice to meet you.

                                     DANIEL
                         Um, how are you doing?

                                     MELISSA
                         Good, how are you?

               She fiddles with her purse. Its obvious she's a little 
               nervous.

                                     DANIEL
                         Cool. Did you have a good day at 
                         school?

                                     MELISSA
                         It was good; I only had three classes, 
                         so...

                                     DANIEL
                         It's so nice to finally see you.

                                     MELISSA
                              (smiling shyly)
                         You too.

               Daniel tries to cover up an awkward silence.

                                     DANIEL
                         It's a nice day.

                                     MELISSA
                              (smiling and nodding)
                         Yeah it is.

               More silence, less awkward this time. Daniel looks at Melissa 
               and they giggle a little.

                                     DANIEL
                         Do you want to take a walk?

                                     MELISSA
                         Sure.

               They start to walk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Daniel and Melissa running up a hill towards a picnic table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Daniel and Melissa sitting on a picnic table. They are sitting 
               very close.

                                     DANIEL
                         So what do you want to do?

                                     MELISSA
                         I don't know. What do you normally 
                         do on a first date?

                                     DANIEL
                              (teasingly)
                         I thought this wasn't supposed to be 
                         a date.

                                     MELISSA
                         That was before...

                                     DANIEL
                         Well... I want to do something 
                         special. Something you've never done 
                         before.

                                     MELISSA
                         Well name something and I'll tell 
                         you if I've done it or not.

                                     DANIEL
                         Skydiving. You ever been skydiving?

                                     MELISSA
                              (laughing)
                         Skydiving?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, jump out of a plane, have some 
                         fun.

                                     MELISSA
                         Yes, I know, but why would I want to 
                         jump out of a plane?

                                     DANIEL
                         It would be fun. I'm serious, we 
                         should go skydiving.

               Melissa shakes her head, amused.

                                     DANIEL
                         The only thing is that I heard the 
                         first time you jump you have to go 
                         strapped to someone's crotch.

                                     MELISSA
                              (shaking her head 
                              vehemently)
                         No.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah!

                                     MELISSA
                         I'm not doing it.

                                     DANIEL
                              (laughing)
                         Wha... why?

                                     MELISSA
                         Hello, jumping out of a plane however 
                         far up that is, and being strapped 
                         to someone, and maybe having my 
                         parachute not come out...

                                     DANIEL
                              (flirtatiously)
                         You can go strapped to me if you 
                         want.

                                     MELISSA
                         Have you ever skydived before?

                                     DANIEL
                              (laughing)
                         Of course, I do it all the time.

               Melissa is looking at him suspiciously. She suspects he's 
               just teasing her.

                                     MELISSA
                         Are you just kidding?

               Daniel is laughing again.

                                     DANIEL
                         Anyways, um, actually the reason you 
                         have to go strapped to someone is 
                         because 1 out of 100 people have 
                         faulty parachutes.

                                     MELISSA
                         Exactly!

               Daniel nudges her a little, smiling.

                                     DANIEL
                              (teasingly)
                         Just kidding. You're scared.

                                     MELISSA
                         I am!

               Daniel leans a little closer, nudging her with his shoulder.  
               It's obvious she likes the attention, but still feels a little 
               nervous around him.

                                     DANIEL
                         Maybe we should go see a scary 
                         movie...

                                     MELISSA
                         I told you how I feel about scary 
                         movies.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yet you watch them by yourself in 
                         the dark when you're bored?

                                     MELISSA
                              (smiling sheepishly 
                              and giggling)
                         Yeah, I like them but they scare the 
                         hell out of me; I'm a freak.

                                     DANIEL
                         But you like it

                                     MELISSA
                              (Teasing voice)
                         Do you?

                                     DANIEL
                         Let's see...

               Daniel moves closer to Melissa and looks straight in her 
               eyes.

                                     MELISSA
                         What are you looking at?

                                     DANIEL
                         Your eyes...

                                     MELISSA
                         What about them?

                                     DANIEL
                         Well, they're beautiful, but they're 
                         also dilating.

                                     MELISSA
                         What does that mean?

                                     DANIEL
                         That you like what you're looking 
                         at.

                                     MELISSA
                         Is that really what it means?

                                     DANIEL
                         Actually, yeah. In magazines they 
                         dim the lights before taking the 
                         shots so the models look excited and 
                         like they enjoy staring at the 
                         intended audience... so what do you 
                         want to do?

               Again, he leans into her a little, trying to be seductive.  
               She's shy.

                                     MELISSA
                         I don't know.

                                     DANIEL
                         Ah, lets go see a movie.

                                     MELISSA
                         What kind?

                                     DANIEL
                         Zombie killers four.

               Melissa gives him a "come on" look.

                                     DANIEL
                              (laughing)
                         I'm just kidding..

                                     MELISSA
                              (ruefully)
                         Well, nothing can be as bad as Death 
                         Stalkers 3.

                                     DANIEL
                         Zombie Killers 4. But the zombie 
                         genre's been coming back. There have 
                         been like four new zombie movies; 
                         there's even a comedy, Shane of the 
                         Dead.

                                     MELISSA
                         I saw that one.

                                     DANIEL
                         Really? You saw Shane of the Dead?

               Daniel is laughing, surprised.

                                     MELISSA
                         I did; it was funny.

                                     DANIEL
                              (agreeing))
                         It was hilarious.

                                     MELISSA
                         I was still freaked out though.  
                         Please don't laugh at me.  Maybe 
                         I'll see it, but you have to promise 
                         to stay with me for awhile afterwards.

                                     DANIEL
                         Why's that?

                                     MELISSA
                         Cause I get scared.  I know it's 
                         stupid, but I can't help it.  It's 
                         so bad.  I get scared by anything.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh, zombie killers isn't really going 
                         to be that scary.

                                     MELISSA
                         I got freaked out by the Jaberwokki 
                         from Alice in Wonderland.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh my god... that is bad.

               He smiles and takes her hand.

                                     DANIEL
                         Come on, let's go on a walk.

                                     MELISSA
                         Where do you want to go?

               He points in a random direction. They appear more relaxed 
               around each other.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well, first let's go this way.

                                     MELISSA
                              (not really paying 
                              attention)
                         Okay.

                                     DANIEL
                         Then when we're done going that way, 
                         let's go over there. Then lets go 
                         talk to some runners.

               He laughs and Melissa shakes her head.

                                     MELISSA
                         What?

               She realizes he's teasing and laughs with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - MELISSA'S CAR - DAY

               Daniel is standing next to Melissa. There is a slight 
               awkwardness and they are both staring at each other. It is 
               quiet for a few seconds. They hug.

                                     MELISSA
                         I had a really good time.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, I'm so glad I finally got to 
                         meet you.  This is great.  When can 
                         I see you again?

                                     MELISSA
                         Tomorrow.

                                     DANIEL
                         Really?

               Melissa smiles sweetly and seductively at him and then slowly 
               turns and starts to walk away. Daniel reaches for her before 
               she goes a couple steps.

               He pulls her to him and puts his arms around her and gives 
               her a hug.  They kiss on the lips. She's shy and a little 
               awkward. More silence, but this time filled with sexual 
               tension as opposed to awkwardness.

                                     DANIEL
                              (Smiling)
                         Good bye Melissa.

                                     MELISSA
                              (Smiling back)
                         Bye.

               MELISSA gets in her car and drives away.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. COMMONS - COMMON AREAS - COUCH

               Daniel is hanging out with CASEY again.  They are both 
               drinking beer.

                                     CASEY
                         Hey I'm going to try and get some 
                         'shrooms this weekend.  Do you want 
                         to trip with me.

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't think so.  I've never done 
                         that before.

                                     CASEY
                         Have you tried any psychedelics 
                         before?

                                     DANIEL
                         No.

                                     CASEY
                         That's like dying and having never 
                         had sex.

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't know about that, I've seen 
                         them do some bad things to my friends.  
                         Nightmares, flashbacks, etc.

                                     CASEY
                         Oh that only happens if you way over 
                         do it.  It's not something you're 
                         suppose to do all the time, just 
                         every once in a great while.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, but what's the point?

                                     CASEY
                         It gives you a new perspective and 
                         takes you completely out of your 
                         element.  It's a little hard too 
                         explain to someone who has never 
                         experienced it before.

                                     DANIEL
                         Doesn't it make you stupid?

                                     CASEY
                         Do I seem stupid to you?  Wait... 
                         don't answer that.  Anyway, it changes 
                         you, but for the better. It improves 
                         your creativity. It could give you 
                         that inspiration you're always looking 
                         for.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, but I don't think it's worth 
                         the bad things It can do.

                                     CASEY
                         Well I believe in the 50 times rule.  
                         After 50 times you have permanent 
                         psychosis, cause there is only so 
                         much your mind can take before it 
                         completely detaches from reality.  
                         Well, heave you've ever read or heard 
                         about the LSD experiments the 
                         government did?  They experimented 
                         on some their top scientists without 
                         their knowledge.  They were dosed 
                         with an insanely high amount and 
                         tripped for like a week.  Afterwards 
                         they returned to their normal jobs 
                         and continued working for the 
                         government, except for one guy, who 
                         went completely insane and then tried 
                         to sue the government for causing 
                         his mental illness.  He tried to 
                         kill everyone that turned completely 
                         homicidal.  My mother works as a 
                         nurse at Precious Heart Hospital and 
                         the third floor is completely devoted 
                         to mental patients that can't come 
                         back into society and most of them 
                         are former drug addicts.  People 
                         that abuse meth really bad can go 
                         into a homicidal psychosis 
                         permanently, where they are always 
                         trying to kill random people and 
                         have delusions of persecution.

                                     DANIEL
                         Crazy, you definitely don't make it 
                         sound very appealing.

                                     CASEY
                         Well that's only in the extremes. A 
                         little bit completely changes you, 
                         but for the better.  You should try 
                         it sometime.

                                     DANIEL
                         No thanks. I've talked to too many 
                         hippy fucks who try to tell me 
                         everything they've learned from 
                         tripping. It usually consists of 
                         seeing how it's all energy that comes 
                         up from the ground and flows through 
                         everything, cause everything is 
                         connected and that they've learned 
                         so much, but can't describe it. I'm 
                         like OK, you've learned nonsense... 
                         great.

                                     CASEY
                         How was your date with Melissa?

                                     DANIEL
                         It was great actually.  She's a really 
                         cool girl.

                                     CASEY
                         Have you hit it yet?

                                     DANIEL
                         No... and I don't want to right away.  
                         I really like this girl.

                                     CASEY
                         Oh come on, Mr. Insomniac.  Why would 
                         you want to wait?  Don't you get 
                         tired of jacking off to internet 
                         porn?

                                     DANIEL
                         Haha...

                                     CASEY
                         The Donkey show is a lot less 
                         interesting the 18th time.

                                     DANIEL
                              (Laughing)
                         You're a fucking pervert.

               Casey begins making humping noises and moving his hips back 
               and forth.  He continues and gets really into it.

               A COLLEGE GIRL

               enters the common area and stares at Casey.  He doesn't notice 
               her at first.  Then he stops and looks, embarrassed. He tries 
               to play it cool.

                                     CASEY
                         Hi.  What are you up to?

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

               Daniel sits on his bed, writing rapidly.

               CLOSEUP - NOTEBOOK

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         Slowly running my hand over her face, 
                         the tips pressing ever so softly 
                         against her skin, from her lips, to 
                         her neck, to her chest... over her 
                         belly and down to her...
                              (sigh)
                         Gazing into her eyes, enveloped in 
                         utter stillness, thrust against her 
                         skin, stillness...kisses, lips parted 
                         slightly as my tongue caresses the 
                         soft warmth of her tender neck. The 
                         small quivers of skin, eruptions 
                         spilling gently against my fingers 
                         as I run them across her naked back, 
                         hands exploring the intricacies of 
                         her soul. Long kisses... hot, as I 
                         press my lower lip against her skin, 
                         moving slowly, building into fast, 
                         deep kisses that touch every inch of 
                         her body. Moaning, clenched in my 
                         arms... hot... sweaty... hard, then 
                         soft... the shock and vibration of 
                         her body as I stroke her to 
                         distraction, continuing the rhythm, 
                         with every thrust slowly increasing, 
                         harder... faster... eyes locked... 
                         building... skin inflamed... hot, 
                         scorching, no release... then... 
                         ahhhhhhhh, ecstasy, sweet, hot and 
                         intense.  When you're lying in post-
                         coital sweat, every fiber of your 
                         body screaming with exquisite 
                         sensitivity , drained, the muscles 
                         relaxed, poured onto the bed as the 
                         breath steadies, lying next to 
                         perfection... then, my friend, you've 
                         found heaven.

               Daniel smiles.  He looks down at his writing again.

               DANIEL'S POV

               The scrawled, jumbled writing on the page.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     DANIEL
                              (Softly, smiling to 
                              himself)
                         Well it's quite obvious I'm a horny 
                         bastard.

               EXT. FIELD SOMEWHERE - DANIEL AND MELISSA ARE PLAYING

               Daniel and MELISSA are running around having fun and being 
               goofy.

                                     DANIEL
                         Have you seen Dirty Dancing?

                                     MELISSA
                         Who hasn't?  That's the best movie 
                         ever.

               They continue to play around. They are laughing and having 
               fun. Melissa runs and jumps on Daniel he isn't ready and 
               almost falls over and they are unsuccessful.  They both laugh.

                                     DANIEL
                         Wait, you have to warn me first OK?  
                         Let's try it slowly this time.

                                     MELISSA
                         Okay. Don't drop me.

               They try again.  She doesn't balance right and again they 
               fall over, laughing.

               They go over to a tree. Daniel helps Melissa climb; she has 
               trouble.

                                     DANIEL
                         Ok, put your foot here. Now pull.  
                         Good.

                                     MELISSA
                         I can't...

                                     DANIEL
                         Yes you can. I've got you. Push.  
                         Higher. Come on. I've got you. Use 
                         some upper body strength.

               Melissa is laughing. He boosts her up and steps back, leaving 
               her halfway up the tree. Her legs are dangling. They are 
               both laughing.

                                     MELISSA
                         I need to get up more. Daniel!  
                         Daniel!

               She continues to dangle. Daniel laughs, watching, and smacks 
               her bottom. They laugh again. It's obvious they're having 
               fun.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Daniel and Melissa are hanging out. They are sitting on 
               Daniel's bed. Melissa is holding the script for Harmony.

                                     MELISSA
                         Harmony is really good; I like the 
                         how the demon whose haunting him is 
                         really himself.

                                     DANIEL
                         That was supposed to be the most 
                         powerful part. The realization that 
                         all his problems, all his hate, and 
                         everything that was combined and 
                         traced out towards the world is really 
                         a reflection of his own cruelty rather 
                         than the cruelty of the world. The 
                         metaphor of the demon being a young 
                         version of himself.

                                     MELISSA
                         I love the symbolism; it's great.

                                     DANIEL
                         You should help me write something.

                                     MELISSA
                         Help you how?

                                     DANIEL
                         UM... help me with some ideas.

                                     MELISSA
                         I read...

                                     DANIEL
                              (teasingly)
                         Give me some crazy ideas. I know 
                         you're a literature nut.

                                     MELISSA
                         I read books. I like looking at them 
                         and analyzing them, but as for 
                         writing, that's all you.  I can help 
                         you edit, help you submit it to 
                         publishers, but that's about it.

                                     DANIEL
                         That would be cool... how do you 
                         know so much about publishing and 
                         editing and stuff?

                                     MELISSA
                         My parents have a small publishing 
                         business. Its actually pretty 
                         successful, so I've been immersed in 
                         the publishing world all my life. 
                         It's probably why I love books, though 
                         I should be sick of them at this 
                         point.

               Daniel is surprised.

                                     DANIEL
                         Crazy. How come you never mentioned 
                         that before?

                                     MELISSA
                         I don't know. I didn't really think 
                         about it, I guess.

                                     DANIEL
                         Hmm.  I need to write something 
                         bigger; better than Harmony.

                                     MELISSA
                         Why bigger? Why not start off little?

                                     DANIEL
                         I want something... I'm a 
                         perfectionist. I hate reading my own 
                         work.

               He points to Harmony.

                                     DANIEL
                         When I read something like that, I 
                         think 'ah, this is horrible' which 
                         is normal, I guess. I know its okay, 
                         but its not what I want.

                                     MELISSA
                         So, another random question. What's 
                         the first thing you look at in someone 
                         when you're trying to figure out 
                         what's going on in their head? What's 
                         going on in their mind?

                                     DANIEL
                         Where did that come from?

                                     MELISSA
                         I don't know. Nowhere, I guess.  
                         Just thoughts.

                                     DANIEL
                         Just thoughts, huh? There are a lot 
                         of things I look at. How they're 
                         body moves, how they move their 
                         hands... but mostly their eyes. Their 
                         eyes show if they're in pain happy, 
                         or sad; if they're anxious or they 
                         want something. Get an in depth look 
                         at their personality.

                                     MELISSA
                         You can tell all that from someone's 
                         eyes?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yes, and a lot more.

                                     MELISSA
                         What do you see in my eyes?

                                     DANIEL
                         I see beauty, and innocence, and a 
                         die-hard romantic... but you are 
                         kind of hard to read.

                                     MELISSA
                         Why's that?

                                     DANIEL
                         You just are. I don't make the rules. 
                         Why are you laughing?

                                     MELISSA
                         I don't know... it's hard when 
                         someone's talking about you and what 
                         you're like. And I am a hopeless 
                         romantic... you got that right.

                                     DANIEL
                         And much more... what's your biggest 
                         fear Melissa?

                                     MELISSA
                         That I'll never fall in love

                                     DANIEL
                         I guarantee that won't happen...

                                     MELISSA
                         How do you know?  I haven't fallen 
                         in love yet.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well for one thing, hormones and 
                         nature will make you fall in love 
                         sometime no matter what...

                                     MELISSA
                         I hate that you think like that.

                                     DANIEL
                         If you put two people on an island 
                         with no one else they'll fall in 
                         love.  Nature has a part in love too 
                         you know.  But it's not a bad thing.. 
                         nature is beautiful, love is 
                         beautiful.  I just understand how it 
                         works.  Nature is a catalyst... for 
                         your feelings... it doesn't create 
                         your feelings... but it can help you 
                         realize them.  Does that makes sense?

                                     MELISSA
                         Kinda, but I don't know... I believe 
                         in soul mates... That there is one 
                         person you are destined to be with

               Daniel smiles.

                                     MELISSA
                         What? I really do! I know it's silly, 
                         but I can't help it.

                                     DANIEL
                         It's not silly, it's cute. You're 
                         cute.

                                     MELISSA
                              (smiles sweetly up at 
                              him)
                         So what's your biggest fear?

                                     DANIEL
                         Being alone... like ending up alone.

                                     MELISSA
                         I thought you said nature would make 
                         sure you fell in love.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, but being in love doesn't mean 
                         you won't be alone... the only thing 
                         that really exists is the moment 
                         right now... that's my biggest fear... 
                         being trapped in fleeting moments 
                         where all I can think about is how 
                         much I love someone and not being 
                         able to express it... being forever 
                         alone...no one to care about or share 
                         myself with... I hate being alone.

                                     MELISSA
                         I'm sure you'll never be alone for 
                         any real length of time.

                                     DANIEL
                         Why's that?

                                     MELISSA
                         Because you're too nice a guy.

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh god, please don't say that.

                                     MELISSA
                         Say what?

                                     DANIEL
                         You just called me a nice guy.

                                     MELISSA
                         So?

                                     DANIEL
                         Girls don't like nice guys

                                     MELISSA
                         I do.

               Melissa leans over and kisses Daniel softly on the cheek.

                                     MELISSA
                         Have you ever been in love before?

                                     DANIEL
                         Once.

                                     MELISSA
                         Really?

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah.

                                     MELISSA
                         Why didn't it work out?

                                     DANIEL
                         She was very career oriented, which 
                         is cool, but I was still an undergrad 
                         and she graduated and was going to 
                         leave for grad school. I had to stay 
                         and finish my degree. I don't do 
                         long distance relationships, so it 
                         was goodbye. I don't want someone 
                         without ambition, but I do want 
                         someone who will support me and will 
                         make decisions in our best interest. 
                         And at the time I didn't plan on 
                         being suck in this same city.

                                     MELISSA
                         Why are you still here?

                                     DANIEL
                         Still waiting for my inspiration. I 
                         am going to write something incredible 
                         someday.

                                     MELISSA
                         What happened to her?

                                     DANIEL
                         She moved, met someone else, and got 
                         married.

                                     MELISSA
                         Wow... that was quick.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well, she's a little older than me, 
                         so it was probably her "time."

                                     MELISSA
                         What's a little older?

                                     DANIEL
                         Two years.

                                     MELISSA
                         What's name?

                                     DANIEL
                         Sarah.

                                     MELISSA
                         Do you still love her?

                                     DANIEL
                         I'll always love her. I think if you 
                         really love someone that your feelings 
                         will never go away.

                                     MELISSA
                         Oh... I guess I sort of understand... 
                         Daniel, do you care that I'm only 
                         16?

                                     DANIEL
                         Of course not.  I think it's hot.  
                         What's sexier then a beautiful young 
                         girl.

                                     MELISSA
                         Is that the only reason you like me?  
                         I mean, why do you like me so much; 
                         what makes me so different?

                                     DANIEL
                         Oh, come on now... I love how you 
                         look at me, how you talk, the 
                         excitement in your eyes when we talk 
                         about playing tag on moon... why 
                         would you ask me that?

                                     MELISSA
                              (shyly, looking down)
                         I don't know...

                                     DANIEL
                              (softly)
                         Melissa...

                                     MELISSA
                              (looks up)
                         Yeah?

                                     DANIEL
                         Can I kiss you?

               Melissa looks into Daniel's eyes.  He slowly moves his finger 
               to the side of her face.  He runs them down her neck and 
               slowly on to her chest.

               Melissa closes her eyes, then opens them and looks excited, 
               but slightly nervous.

               Daniel leans forward and kisses her.  They pull apart, 
               smiling.

                                     MELISSA
                         I like you.

                                     DANIEL
                         I like you too.

                         Hey, hold on a second, something's 
                         different.

               Casey moves a little closer to Daniel and looks at him.  
               Daniel smiles and has a funny grin.

                                     DANIEL
                         What do you mean?

                                     CASEY
                         You're glowing.

                                     DANIEL
                         Glowing? What?

                                     CASEY
                         You got laid didn't you? You had sex 
                         with Melissa?

                                     DANIEL
                         No. Well, not yet anyway.

                                     CASEY
                         Not yet, when are you planning it?

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm not, I really like this girl.

                                     CASEY
                         What do you guys do together?

                                     DANIEL
                         We talk about everything and nothing 
                         at the same time.

                                     CASEY
                         Uh huh... everything and nothing... 
                         weirdo.  Dude, I know what you should 
                         write about!

                                     DANIEL
                         What?

                                     CASEY
                         Write about what you know. Write 
                         about Melissa, that's what's 
                         interesting to me.  Tell me about 
                         her.

                                     DANIEL
                         What about her?

                                     CASEY
                         How she breathes, how she feels, 
                         what that does to you.  I think it 
                         would be interesting.

                                     DANIEL
                         That's a great idea!

               A cat wanders into the room.  Casey picks it up and cradles 
               it like a baby.

                                     CASEY
                         You're a stupid cat aren't you? You're 
                         just stoopid, huh? Yeah, you're just 
                         a big baby.

                         Something sexy.

                                     DANIEL
                         Something sexy?

                                     MELISSA
                         Yeah

                                     DANIEL
                         Why's that?

               Melissa smiles.  They begin to dance.  Daniel picks her up 
               like you would carry a baby and takes her to the bed. They 
               fall onto it and start making out.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               Daniel and Melissa are lying in bed together.  The sheets 
               are messed up and Daniel has his arm around her.

                                     DANIEL
                         How do you feel?

               Melissa smiles and snuggles into Daniel, burying her head a 
               little in the crook of his arm.

                                     MELISSA
                         Good... how do you feel?

                                     DANIEL
                         Alive.

                         Alive?  What do you mean?

                                     DANIEL
                         I feel energized, full of life, ready 
                         to take on the world.  What do you 
                         want to today?  Let's go for a walk, 
                         or even better, go hiking?  Wait. 
                         What about a road trip?  San Francisco 
                         would be fun.

                                     MELISSA
                         Um, no, hello.  I have to go to school 
                         and then back home so my parents 
                         won't suspect anything.

                                     DANIEL
                         What would happen if your parents 
                         found out about me?

                                     MELISSA
                         Well... that's not going to happen.

                                     DANIEL
                         But what would happen if they did?

                                     MELISSA
                         They would freak and probably try to 
                         prosecute you.  My mom would be more 
                         likely to be okay with it, but my 
                         dad would absolutely freak.

                                     MELISSA
                         You know why; I think I'm in love 
                         with Daniel.

                                     CLARISSA
                              (in a teasing voice)
                         I can't believe you had sex with 
                         him, you're such a slut.

                                     MELISSA
                         Clarissa!

                                     CLARISSA
                         Just kidding! Well, you should at 
                         least bring him sometime when we all 
                         hang out.

                                     MELISSA
                         Don't you think that would be weird?

                                     CLARISSA
                         Yeah, but I want to meet him.

                                     MELISSA
                         But what if my parents find out?

                                     CLARISSA
                         Do you really think you can hide it 
                         from them forever?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT - ONE MONTH LATER

               Daniel is drinking another caffeine drink and writing.  He 
               is typing on his laptop once again.

               CELL PHONE RINGS.

               Daniel answers it.

               INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

                                     MELISSA
                         Daniel, I'm pregnant.
                              (beat)

               INTERCUT telephone conversation.

               Daniel is shocked. He fumbles a bit and rubs his face.

                                     DANIEL
                              (fast and nervously)
                         Oh my god... shit... are you okay? 
                         Are you alright?  Where are you? 
                         I'll come pick you up.

                                     MELISSA
                         You can't right now. My parents are 
                         home.

                                     DANIEL
                         I don't care about that. I need to 
                         see you.

                                     MELISSA
                         I'm sorry. I-I just can't.  I'll be 
                         okay, honestly.

                                     DANIEL
                         No, you won't, you're pregnant.  
                         What are we going to do... oh my god 
                         my life could be over... let me come 
                         get you... go away with me.

                                     MELISSA
                         Stop talking crazy, Daniel.

                                     DANIEL
                         What do you think about an abortion?

                                     MELISSA
                         What-!? Damn, my mom is calling me, 
                         I'll call you back.

               MELISSA hangs up.

                                     DANIEL
                         Wait...

               PHONE is DEAD. Melissa is no longer on the line. Daniel is 
               still holding the phone in shock.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. BASEMENT - HANDHELD SHOT - DANIEL'S POV - NIGHT

               A dingy floor, a beer bottle, a notebook of scribbles.  A 
               feeling of uneasiness.

               SLURP CHUG SPLASH

               A shaky hand sets down a beer bottle.

               THUD THUD THUD

               Someone is walking heavily down a stair case nearby.

               PAN TO - CASEY

               He has a soccer ball in hand and a slightly exasperated 
               expression as he approaches.

                                     CASEY
                         Dude what's going on, I've been 
                         looking for you for like the last 
                         ten minutes.  You're not in your 
                         room

                                     DANIEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Melissa's pregnant.  Fuck man, what 
                         the fuck am I going to do?
                              (pacing back and forth 
                              nervously)

                                     CASEY
                         Man, are you sure she's pregnant

                                     DANIEL
                         That's what she told me... my life's 
                         over.  She's mad at me, her parents 
                         are going to find out... I'm going 
                         to jail... I'm a fucking idiot.

                                     CASEY
                              (in a more serious, 
                              calming voice)
                         Calm down Daniel. Make sure its for 
                         real and that she takes a pregnancy 
                         test.

                                     DANIEL
                         Why do you keep saying that?

                                     CASEY
                         'Cause girls are wrong about that 
                         sometimes or they tell you that to 
                         get a rise out of you.  It's happened 
                         to me a few times and they never 
                         ended up being pregnant.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well, Melissa isn't like that.

                                     CASEY
                         Trust me, ask her to take a pregnancy 
                         test at Planned Parenthood.

                                     DANIEL
                         Won't her parents find out for sure 
                         then?

                                     CASEY
                         It's anonymous.

               Daniel continues to drink.

                                     CASEY
                         Trust me, you'll be alright.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Daniel is stumbling around drunk. He calls MELISSA'S PHONE... 
               it RINGS five times, then her VOICE MAIL comes on.

                                     DANIEL
                              (In a drunken slur)
                         Melissa I'll take care of you.  Don't 
                         worry about anything.  I have money. 
                         We'll be happy. Run away with me...
                              (more drunken, 
                              incoherent slur)

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. PARK - DAY

               Daniel walks up to Melissa on a park bench and immediately 
               gives her a passionate hug.  She hugs him back and they pause 
               in each other's arms.

                                     DANIEL
                         Hi.

                                     MELISSA
                         Hi.

                                     DANIEL
                         I missed you

                                     MELISSA
                         I missed you, too.

               They talk for several minutes in hushed voices, but they are 
               agitated.

               CLOSEUP - DANIEL AND MELISSA'S FACES

                                     DANIEL
                         You're not pregnant?  What the fuck! 
                         Why did you lie to me?

                                     MELISSA
                         I didn't lie! I wasn't sure...  I 
                         thought I was because my period was 
                         a week and a half late...

                                                                   FADE TO:

                                     DANIEL
                         You want a fantasy, this is real. 
                         The guy you want doesn't exist.  
                         This isn't a fucking movie.  This is 
                         real; I'm real.

                                     MELISSA
                         I know what I want...

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, and what is that?

                                     MELISSA
                         God, I don't know, but not this.

                                     DANIEL
                         Well... at least this way life is 
                         interesting.

                                     MELISSA
                         You're a mess, Daniel.

               INT. - DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

               Daniel is again drinking beer.  He's pacing back and forth, 
               looking very nervous.  He's  looking at a small black jewelry 
               box.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               FADE IN:

               INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

               He is drinking more beer and looking over some text.  He is 
               rough-shaven and looks depressed. He is editing something on 
               the computer for awhile.  He presses print.

               INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN

               Printing page 1 of 550.

               BACK TO SCENE

               It finishes printing and Daniel sighs and puts the pages 
               together in order. He continues drinking more of his beer. 
               He makes a large stack and then assembles them.

               He pulls out  the black jewelry box and reveals a beautiful 
               ring.  He puts both the manuscript and the ring in a packet.

               EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

               Daniel walks to a post office drop off box and drops the 
               package in.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               INT. MELISSA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               She is looking through her mail and sees a big package.  She 
               opens it and takes out both the jewelry box and the ring.

               She begins to read.

               CLOSEUP - MELISSA READING

               She reads the whole thing. There are tears in her eyes.  She 
               looks at the ring and puts it on her finger. MELISSA CALLS 
               Daniel.  His PHONE RINGS six times before the ANSWERING 
               MACHINE PICKS UP.  She doesn't leave a message. She gets 
               dressed and leaves.

               EXT. JONES' HOUSE - GARAGE - MELISSA'S CAR

               Melissa gets in her car and drives to Daniel's place.

               INT. COMMONS - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               She walks down the hallway and knocks on his door. Daniel 
               answers, he is holding another beer.

                                     DANIEL
                         Hello.

                                     MELISSA
                         Hi.  You're still awake.

                                     DANIEL
                              (soft and slowly)
                         I've been going through a little 
                         insomnia again lately. Did you get 
                         my package?

                                     MELISSA
                              (emotionally)
                         Daniel, it is beautiful.  That's the 
                         most beautiful thing anyone has ever 
                         given me.

                                     DANIEL
                         I'm glad you liked it.

                                     MELISSA
                         I loved it... whats that?

               She points to the beer in his hand.

                                     DANIEL
                         Why do you care?

                                     MELISSA
                         Why do I-you know what, whatever. 
                         Bye --

                                     DANIEL
                              (reaching out and 
                              grabbing her hand)
                         Melissa, wait... I'm sorry
                              (hugs her)

                                     MELISSA
                         You're an alcoholic. And I do care, 
                         because I love you.

                                     DANIEL
                         I prefer drunk... but yes I know.  
                         And I'm working on that.

                                     MELISSA
                         How?  By drinking yourself to death.  
                         You know what Daniel? I think you do 
                         get scared.

                                     DANIEL
                         Of what?

                                     MELISSA
                         Not amounting to anything.

                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah...

                                     MELISSA
                         Alcohol is your escape. It allows 
                         you to avoid doing anything useful.

                                     DANIEL
                         Maybe.

               She looks hopeless. He touches her arm, but she shakes him 
               off and walks quickly down the hall. She's sobbing now. He 
               watches her go.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Melissa is in her bedroom and puts Daniel's manuscript in a 
               large manila envelop. She puts a bunch of stamps on it.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. JONES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

               MR. JONES comes home holding a heavily stamped envelope 
               containing the manuscript. He goes to the kitchen and begins 
               to make himself something to eat.

               He sets it down on the counter.  After making his food, he 
               looks at it again.  He's a little bewildered and opens the 
               envelope.  It contains the manuscript and a small note. He 
               picks up the note.

               INSERT - NOTE

               It is a note, ostensibly from Daniel WESTON.

               "DEAR EDITOR: I HAVE WRITTEN WHAT I HOPE TO BE AN ENGAGING 
               AND PROVOCATIVE PIECE ON THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN. IF YOU WOULD 
               TAKE THE TIME JUST TO READ IT OVER, I'M SURE YOU WOULD ENJOY 
               IT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 
               TALKING TO YOU SOON. SINCERELY YOURS, DANIEL WESTON."

               BACK TO SCENE

               MR. JONES frowns a little, shrugs and sits down on the couch, 
               manuscript in hand.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               MR. JONES in the middle of reading the paper.  While he's 
               reading we hear Daniel'S VOICE OVER.

                                     DANIEL (V.O.)
                         She was an angel, about to get her 
                         first taste of mortality, the 
                         realization that it wouldn't last 
                         forever.  That incredible feeling... 
                         that you're free. You want to feel 
                         every tiny fiber of your limited 
                         existence... to dwell in an emotional 
                         sandstorm, to be so flushed with the 
                         human experience that if even if 
                         death came in the preceding seconds, 
                         you would smile, for you knew you 
                         were really, truly alive once. Mr. 
                         Jones picks up the phone and dials. 
                         He speaks to someone on the other 
                         end.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Hi Rob - I've just received a very 
                         interesting manuscript.  I'm going 
                         to send it to you to read. I know we 
                         don't normally look at anonymous 
                         submissions, but you have to read 
                         this; it's great.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT. JONES' HOUSE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE MELISSA'S ROOM - DAY

               Mr. Jones is excited.  He knocks on Melissa's door.

               INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               MELISSA opens the door and MR. JONES enters.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Hey honey, how was your day?

                                     MELISSA
                         Pretty good actually.

               She runs her hand through her hair and Mr. Jones sees the 
               ring.

               CLOSEUP - RING

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSEUP - MR. JONES

               His face looks pinched, as if he's just realizing something.  
               He remembers Daniel describing the ring to his lover in the 
               manuscript, and the description of the lover.

                                     MR. JONES
                              (calmly, but you can 
                              tell something's 
                              wrong)
                         Where did you get that ring Melissa?

                                     MELISSA
                              (looking uncomfortable)
                         Um... I just got it at the mall.

               Mr. Jones looks at her for a moment, turns and walks away. 
               He stops at her door and turns to her again.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Give Daniel my regards, won't you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mr. Jones interrupts her.

                                     MR. JONES
                         How did this happen?

               Melissa is in her room lying on the bed with the pillow over 
               her head. We hear the VOICES of her Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones 
               YELLING at each other in the back ground.

                                     MRS. JONES
                         I can't believe this happened.  That 
                         we were so god-damned blind.  We 
                         have to do something.

                                     MR. JONES
                         We were so stupid... I was stupid...

                                     DANIEL
                         Hi, I'm Daniel Weston. I need to 
                         speak with you.

                                     MRS. JONES
                              (barely controlling 
                              her anger)
                         Honey that man's here.

               Mr. Jones walks to the door.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Who?

                                     MRS. JONES
                         Daniel Weston.

               Mr. Jones looks at Daniel and doesn't say anything for a 
               minute.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Why are you here?

                         Can I please just speak with you?

               Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones look at each other. Mr. Jones looks 
               extremely angry.

                                     MR. JONES
                         So speak.

                                     DANIEL
                         Please, can I come in?

               Mrs. Jones knows her husband will probably yell. She looks 
               outside nervously.

                                     MRS. JONES
                         Homey, please, I don't want the 
                         neighbors to see or hear what's going

                         Fine. You've got five minutes.

                         then do it, but know that I do love 
                         your daughter.  I never intended 
                         this. I just met her and couldn't 
                         help falling in love with her.

                         I know, but that didn't change my 
                         heart.

                         was inspired by your daughter doesn't 
                         mean it's any less valid.
