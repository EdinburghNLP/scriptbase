Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg

     GONE IN 60 SECONDS 
     by Scott Rosenberg
     4/6/99


     "I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
     if this sort of car starts easily?"
          Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
     found that he had hold of the handle and was turning
     it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
     passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
     body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
     car devoured the street, he was only conscious
     that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
     highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
     his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
     might come to him... "

     -- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







     "All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
     hood... "

     -- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









     FADE IN:

     EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

     The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
     of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
     Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
     except -

     A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

     Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
     scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
     before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
     SOMEONE approaches...

     Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
     He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
     that refuses to fade ...

     This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
     quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
     California ...

     Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
     crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
     Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

     But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
     ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          You gonna steal her or kneel down to
          her and pray -- ?

     Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
          I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
          Just take her, slick. - -

     And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
     No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
     coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
     door ...

     Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
     pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

     A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
     socket-like device - is pressed into the
     ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
     like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

     He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
     deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
     And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

     The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
     re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
     fixed and fumy ...

     He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
     behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

     On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

     Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

     A POLICE CAR

     appears behind them...

     And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
     through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
     Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
     respective vehicles...

     The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

                    DONNY
          Problem, Officer?

                    POLICEMAN
          Yes. You're under arrest -- ?

                    DONNY
          For running a stop sign?

                    POLICEMAN
          For Grand Theft Auto -

     And off of Donny's look --

     We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
     toward him, sirens wailing...

     QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
     harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
     ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

     Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
     gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
     pursuit ...

     And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
     heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
     cruisers himself ...

     Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
     ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
     fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

     Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
     a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
     to the roadblock ...

     And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
     bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
     And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
     Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

     And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
     Grand... Looking down ...

     He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
     chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
     the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

     Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

     EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

     Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
     leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
     Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

     A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

     DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

     of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
     is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility
     fool you - the man's a street viper ...

     Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

                    HAWKINGS
          Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of
          Raines...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Well, then it's all for naught,
          ain't it, Hawkings?

     Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
     Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
     Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

     Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
     toward it, hand on hip...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I know you --

                    MEMPHIS
          You know my back -

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          You want to come along quiet?

                    MEMPHIS
          How's Atley -- ?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Leg's all banged-up. He made a
          stupid play ... He'll limp around
          the yard up at Folsom. But
          Astricky will be there to take
          care of him. With their priors,
          they're looking at a serious bounce --

                    MEMPHIS
          Let them go --

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          How's that?

                    MEMPHIS
          Let them go. And I'll leave ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          You'll leave -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          You don't have anything on me. A
          misdee auto-theft. I got no record.
          I'll be out in three days, and back at 
          it. Or you let them go, and I give
          you my word. I'm gone. And without the
          ringleader ... Your tee-times have
          just grown exponentially...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I don't golf...

     And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
          I do this. And I see you again. I'll
          come after you with everything I got.
          you won't be able to steal a glance
          at a blind man without me by your side ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You have my word...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Get out of here, then. Now.

     And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Leave the car, Randall ...

     Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
     leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
     Grand ...

     Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Arright, let lim go. Cite him for
          rolling the stop ... And cite old
          Atley for driving to endanger ...

                    HAWKINGS
          What are you talking about, Rollie? We're
          springing 'em? Just like that?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Just like that. Quit your bellyaching,
          Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...

     And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to
     crescendo and we

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER

     Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one
     horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,
     single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell
     would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small,
     GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads:

     "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE"

     owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls,
     Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid
     - TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --

                    MEMPHIS
          You know what you got here?

                    TOM
          Not really -

                    MEMPHIS
          There's excessive resistance in the cranking
          circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?

                    TOM
          Not really --

                    MEMPHIS
          You have any other answers besides
          "not really"?

                    TOM
          Not --

                    MEMPHIS
          Right. You want to test the voltage drop ...
          Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary
          lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...
          See what you got ... You understand -- ?

     Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a
     root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To
     where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking
     an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 
     200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...

                    BUDGY
          Just can't find good help these days --

                    MEMPHIS
               (re: cigarette)
          Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --

                    BUDGY
          They won't have a chance. The bourbon and
          bacon'll get me first...

     Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...
     Budgy points at a passing car ...

                    BUDGY (cont'd)
          That one -

                    MEMPHIS
          1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ...
          Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell;
          they modified the chassis, but didn't
          improve its performance...

     Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play
     this game every day...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof
          positive of a single all-powerful Deity.
          The first bargain-priced muscle car
          ever. They even tuned the horn to
          resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
          cartoon Road Runner ...

     And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

                    BUDGY
          Damn, you're good

     Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

                    BUDGY (cont'd)
          You got to bingo last night?

     Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

                    MEMPHIS
          That I did, Budgy. That I did --

     And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of
     metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

                    TOM (O.S.)
          Uh ... Randall -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Excuse me --

     Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT

     A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos
     Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little
     dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored
     shades ... In the passenger seat is

     KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop.

     Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business
     district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ...

                    FREB
          The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia.
          Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus
          would be at the corner of Hawthorne
          and Granvia --

                    KIP
          He didn't mess up. There it is ...

     And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty
     foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM
     CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And-
     there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night
     showroom lights...

     Freb and Mirror Man are startled

                    FREB
          That -- ?

                    MIRROR MAN
          You're shittin', right? Kip?

     He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...

                    FREB
          How are we supposed to--

                    KIP
          Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

     Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the
     back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --

                    MIRROR MAN
          What tool -- ?

     Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's
     carrying A BRICK --

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          Oh, no --

     And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ...
     Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT
     THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS
     raining down ...

     ALARMS SQUEAL

     As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb
     and Mirror Man can't believe it --

     INT. EXOTIC MOTORS

     Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her
     open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip,
     unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the
     mechanism... The alarm raging in here...

     In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man
     climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches
     of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the
     showroom...

     EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

     The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a
          stolen car

     Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

                    KIP
          Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?

     And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

                                             CUT TO:

     A TENNIS BALL

     being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ...
     Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

     INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of
     SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The
     tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a
     tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the
     piss out of

     ATLEY JACKSON

     whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks
     with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Can you stop that, for Chrissake?

                    TUMBLER
          What's your problem, bro ?

     Thunk! Thunk!

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Where are they -- ?

                    TUMBLER
          They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back
          in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in
          them veins ... What happened -- ?

     And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the
     far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ...

                    TUMBLER (cont'd)
          Relax and enjoy --

     EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS

     Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up
     next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

     Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are
     implied... Mirror Man panics ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car,
          stolen car ...

                    KIP
          Stolen fast car...

     And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And
     they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip
     smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's
     eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see
          if these British boys are full of shit
          or not --

                    MIRROR MAN
          No way, man --

     Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The
     gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an
     embolism...

     They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware
     of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...
     And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

     THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,
     warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow
     graceful against the moonlit water ...

     INT. WAREHOUSE

     Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He
     looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?

                    TUMBLER
          Yeah. I'm missing Springer --

     And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes
     Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the
     car...

     Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it
     ... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)
     1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

                    MIRROR MAN
          I can vouch for that.

     Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

                    TUMBLER
          Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

                    KIP
          No problem -

     Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE
     SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the
     chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the 
     thuggish man gets to his feet ...

                    THUGGISH MAN
          Let's get outta here -- !

     And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with
     his limp ... On the way out:

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Now you gone and done it, Raines
          And they flee ...

     INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

     A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual
     spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig
     circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective
     Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...

     INT. WAREHOUSE

     Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner
     DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience -
     comes out from the back ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          They're gone...

     Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...

     INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK

     Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a
     brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
     It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses
     danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks
     spooked... Tom, too ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What's going on -- ?

     And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY
     JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of
     place here as a maggot on a muffin...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Well, well, well ...

     And he begins to sing...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
               (ANDY GRIFFITH theme)
          Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
               (laughs)
          Are you kidding me, man -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Hello, Atley ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign)
          L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ...

     Memphis studies him...

                    MEMPHIS
          How's the leg?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit
          you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt
          Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's
          Opie at?

     He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What are you doing here?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Is there someplace we can talk?

     Memphis looks at him...

                    MEMPHIS
          What about?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          About your brother. And the deeeep
          shit he's in --

     INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

                    WAITRESS
          There you go --

                    MEMPHIS
          Thanks, Donna --

     She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          It's been a long time, Memphis --

                    MEMPHIS
          Six years ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it?
          Six years ago we were fartin' through
          Armani and pissin' Cristal.
          Now look at us ...

          MEMPHIS
          Tell me about Kip -

     Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          He took a job. And he fumbled it.
          Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...

                    MEMPHIS
          What kind of job... ?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          A boost. A big boost ...

                    MEMPHIS
          A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

     Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          You're shittin', right?

     Clearly Memphis is not ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
          Kip's become quite the little
          crewrunner since you left. He's been
          working a low-rent ring for
          two years now. You don't talk to
          your Ma?

                    MEMPHIS
          It seems she neglected to mention it

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Maybe she don't know. Although I don't
          see how that could be. Maybe she didn't
          want to upset you -

                    MEMPHIS
          Don't feel the need to explore my family
          dynamics, Atley...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          The point is: Kip's been living the
          life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy.
          Makes our old behavior seem like
          altar boy time. But he fungold this
          one so bad, folks around L.B.
          are already speakin' about him in
          the past tense.

     Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

                    MEMPHIS
          Who was the job for?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Who do you think?

     Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
          Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter"
          Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ...

     Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face
     speaks volumes ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
          I just thought you should know,
          man. I kind of had a feeling you
          didn't. But I should tell you:
          I'm working for him now - The
          Carpenter - so if you see him, you
          won't mention me coming to get
          you... Like I said: I just thought
          ... I owed you ... And that it was
          the right thing to do ...

     Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,
     As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

     We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

     THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

     placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

     INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

     A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are
     picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

     HELEN RAINES

     early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky
     shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen
     delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

                    KID
          Can I get some more coffee -- ?

                    HELEN RAINES
          Sure, hon ...

     And she goes to the coffee station... When

                    MEMPHIS (O.S.)
          Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna
          melt in this joint -- ?

     And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression
     displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Hello, Ma --

     And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes
     tight ...

                    HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
          Oh, Randall ...

     She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the
     other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook
     smiles from behind the order wheel ...

                    COOK
          What's the word, Memphis -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          How ya doing, Ruby -- ?

                    HELEN RAINES
          Come, come, come ...

     And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -
     on the way...

                    HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
          Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone,
          extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate
          milk... Lots of syrup...
               (to Memphis)
          Right?

                    MEMPHIS
          Right ...

     And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She
     takes his hands...

                    HELEN RAINES
          You look good...

                    MEMPHIS
          You, too, Ma...

                    HELEN RAINES
          What are you doing back?

                    MEMPHIS
          How's Kip?

     And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

                    HELEN RAINES
          Have you seen him?

                    MEMPHIS
          No.

                    HELEN RAINES
          oh.

                    MEMPHIS
          Atley Jackson came to see me ...

                    HELEN RAINES
          Atley Jackson. How is that one?
          How's the leg... ?

     He looks at her ... Beat ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Why didn't you tell me?

                    HELEN RAINES
          I couldn't. I didn't want you to
          worry. I thought held sort himself
          out. I hardly see him. He comes and
          goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

                    MEMPHIS
          He's in some trouble ...

                    HELEN RAINES
          I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a
          different boy. He's lost that... That
          sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't
          know what to do ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You getting my checks ... ?

                    HELEN RAINES
          Of course ...

     ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye
     on Memphis and Helen --

                    RUBY
          Detective Castlebeck... It's me ...
          Yeah... You ain't never gonna guess
          who just come in to visit his Ma --

     BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

                    HELEN RAINES (cont'd)
          You haven't spoken to him in a
          while, I guess...

                    MEMPHIS
          He doesn't return my calls. or my
          letters ...

                    HELEN RAINES
          Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby.
          I don't know what you remember of him.
          But you should brace yourself

     And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"
     and SLAM CUT TO:

     INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

     A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box
     cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and
     Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,
     with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

                    TUMBLER
          ... so ... It's my new move ... It's called
          "The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on
          my hand for 10 minutes.  Till it falls
          asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling.
          And then I jerk off.

                    GIRL
          That's disgusting -

                    FREB
          What's the point, man -- ?

                    TUMBLER
          Cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger
          ... It rocks ... It's the power move of the
          New Millennium...

     He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

                    TOBY
          Hey, Kip, what's up?

                    KIP
          What do you say, Toby?,

                    TOBY
          I'm cool -

                    TUMBLER
          What do you want, shithead?

                    TOBY
          Why you gotta front me like that? I'm
          talking to Kip --

                    TUMBLER
          Why don't you leave him alone?

                    TOBY
          I known Kip longing than you, man ...

                    TUMBLER
          Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --

                    FREB
          Any word, Kip -- ?

                    KIP
          No ... And they won't take my calls ...

                    FREB
          What does that mean -- ?

                    KIP
          It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

     He groks their fear...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          Look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
          We just gotta step it up ...

                    FREB
          But we only got till Friday. That's
          four days. And we lost the 13. So's
          we gotta start over ...

     Kip looks at him...

                    KIP
          That, too ...
               (off of Freb's look of fright)
          Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool.

     ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He
     clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

                    KIP
          It can be done, man. We just gotta
          step it up... It's a challenge ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          The challenge is not to get our nuts
          cut-off and shoved down our throats ...

                    TUMBLER
          Can I help you, pal -- ?

     And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Hey, Kip ...

                    KIP
          Hello, Memphis --

                    TUMBLER
          "Memphis?" You're Memphis?

                    MEMPHIS
          That's right...

                    TUMBLER
          Damn. Damn, damn, damn ...

                    FREB
          Memphis. Holy shit. It's an honor,
          man --

     And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

                    KIP
          It's good to see ya, man. You changed
          your look -

                    MEMPHIS
          You, too

     Hold the stare... The others are excited...

                    FREB
          What are you doing back, Memphis?

                    MEMPHIS
          Little visit. Check on the family.

                    KIP
          It's nice to see ya, man -

     He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

                    TOBY
          Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby
          Walker. I live next door ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

                    TOBY
          Yeah, I'm cool ...

     And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

                    KIP
          Who's got next game -- ?

     And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

                    MIRROR MAN
          I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius:
          Memphis come back to save our bacon!

                    TUMBLER
          Shut-up, Mirror Man --

                    FREB
          Izzat true? You come back to save our
          bacon?

                    MIRROR MAN
          Of course it's true. He come to save
          his brother's dangling ass --

                    KIP
          That can't be it. Cos we don't need
          saving

                    FREB
          We don't -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          He give you an advance -- ?

                    MIRROR MAN
          Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

     Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You just give 'im back the money.
          All's well...

     The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

                    KIP
          "Give lim back the money." "Give 'im
          back the money..." Be nice. If only
          we didn't drink the money. And smoke
          the money. And buy Nikes with the
          money. And Sony Play Stations with the
          money. And dirty girls with the
          money...

     And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They
     nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

                    KIP
          But don't worry, man. Things are all
          sweetness and light here...

                    TUMBLER
          Things are all leafy and suburban ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          The hell they are --

                    KIP
          Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the
          gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled...
          And it was nice to see you -- -

     Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then
     REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet
     and in close, nose to nose ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy
          yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum,
          well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a
          poundcake. But I remember the days when you
          used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em...
          So you can't stop me from saving your
          "dangling ass' if that's what I feel like
          doing...

     And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the
     table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,
     the crowd parting like a wound...

     Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

                    TUMBLER
          Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...

     And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

     EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung
     buildings ...

     EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

     A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
     high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up
     a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is
     FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

     Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
     Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the
     garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

     A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

     INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

     A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,
     interiors, air bags ...

     EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

     Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

                    DOG-FACE
          Yeah -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...

     INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

     Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him
     into another room. Which is

     A WORKSHOP

     An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
     art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

     An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of
     expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked
     against the rear wall ...

     Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
     cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is
     RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

     He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
     Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
     cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

     And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
     wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
     as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's
     as SILENT-as a tomb...

     A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and
     disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

     Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
     Examines his fresh cut...

                    CALITRI
          Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...
               (looks at his clothes;)
               frowns)
          'though I do I recall you as a man
          with style. You remember your old
          friend, Atley -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          How ya doing?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Good to see you, Memphis --

                    CALITRI
          So. What do we owe the honor -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          It's about my brother ... Kip...

                    CALITRI
          Yes ... Kip ...

     He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on
     his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at
     one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to
     several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

                    CALITRI
          Excuse me one moment, Randall ...

     And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

     INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

     is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the
     bloodied windshield.

                    CALITRI
          You bring this to me in this
          condition? Blood and guts all
          over it? You make me complicit?
          On my property? Who taught you
          how to think? And worst of all:
          weren't there supposed to be two
          Hondas?

                    THIEF
          Please ...

     And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and
     legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the
     man is on the floor, howling ...

                    CALITRI
          Stupid sonuvabitch...

     INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

     Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at
     Atley...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after
          himself ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Jesus ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          The business has changed...

     Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

                    CALITRI
          Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.

                    MEMPHIS
          I don't want him hurt...

     Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

                    CALITRI
          I'm proud of this work. The bird
          feeder. The wagon wheel planter.
          The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable
          server...

     He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then
     gestures to the yard...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood
          is warm. Clean. Provided by nature.
          To see a piece of furniture take shape.
          It's like watching a child grow ...

     Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I'm sure you're working your way to
          the point.  I'll wait right here ...

     Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

                    CALITRI
          My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require
          the best. I insist on the best. I only
          engage the best.  Your brother. His
          friends. They came to me. They wanted my
          paper. He was your brother. You were the
          best. Now. They've brought so much
          goddamn heat down, I may not be able to
          fill this order. Which would be very bad
          for me. Which in turn, is very bad for
          them...

                    MEMPHIS
          I could kill you. That occurred to me.
          When I first heard about this. That I
          would kill you ...

                    CALITRI
          Grow up. You don't kill people like me.
          People like me die in their sleep at
          87 ... Do you know why? Because if
          you did kill me, and everyone knew it
          was you - for the next ten years they'd
          be finding pieces of those you love
          scattered all over California ...

     Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          No, no. You don't kill me, because
          you can't. You don't take your brother
          and run, because we'd find him. You
          don't go to the-police, because we have
          friends there, too. You do nothing:
          except deal with me.

     Memphis eyes him...

                    MEMPHIS
          I can come up with the front money.
          Pay you back...

                    CALITRI
          Were it only that easy. I have
          obligations. The order needs to be
          filled...

     Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to
     Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          On that list, you'll find fifty cars.
          Fifty. Five-zero. They range in
          age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird
          to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in
          expense from the 1993 Volkswagen
          Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini
          Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero.

     Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          There is a container ship in Long
          Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be
          loaded with 4-car-per shipping
          containers, false-walled and
          customsprofiled as motor oil
          designated. The ship leaves in four
          days for South America and the
          men who've tendered me this contract ...

                    MEMPHIS
          They gave you only four days?

                    CALITRI
          They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it
          with your brother and his crew, who not
          only lost what pitiful few they managed
          to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
          endeavor, making this even more difficult
          to achieve ...

     Memphis scans the list ...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200
          thousand dollars ...

     Now Memphis looks up...

                    MEMPHIS
          I'm not interested --

                    CALITRI
          I knew you'd say that.

                    MEMPHIS
          I'm just here about my brother.

                    CALITRI
          I knew you'd say that, too --

     Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing
     the trap ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Sound it out for me.

                    CALITRI
          Your brother has four days. Fifty
          cars. Five-zero. For that he gets
          200 large ...

                    MEMPHIS
          And if he doesn't make it -- ?

     Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off
     of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

                    CALITRI
          I made this, too. My first one.
          Brass extension handles, not plated.
          The coverings are silk, not rayon.
          Expensive hardwood. And lined with
          spray green Lorraine crepe ...

     Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In
          case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning,
          if that ship sets off without my
          fifty ... Kip will take up permanent
          residence in this box ...

     Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is
     RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two
     MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
     and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          Come here for a second, boys --

     And they come over --

                    DIGGER
          Evenin', Mr. C. --

                    CALITRI
          Digger, Butz: let me introduce
          you to Randall Raines. Used to
          head up the dandiest ring in
          Southern Cal. Left us
          for parts unknown. Randall, this
          is Digger. And that's Butz -

                    DIGGER
          Hi, Randall --

     Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,
     who go back to work...

                    CALITRI
          Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial.
          They're good boys ...

     Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

                    MEMPHIS
          I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

                    CALITRI
          "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or
          the summer to end. But we
          don't get to choose these things...

     Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri
     turns to Memphis...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          "Nothing that's forced can ever be
          right." Old woodworking expression.
          I really don't care how the 50
          get onto my ship ... I just care
          that they do. You decide.

     With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
     an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
     beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

     EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill
     overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

     INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

     Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We
     see a CRIME SCENE ...

                    REPORTER
          ... the car-jacking, which left Ramona
          Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of
          three, dead, occurred last night at ...

     Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window
     ... At the SEDAN parked below...

     EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

     Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street
     ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I know you.

                    MEMPHIS
          You know my back.

     They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a
     spectacular bedspread of lights ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          When'd you get to town, Raines?

                    MEMPHIS
          The other day....

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          What for?

                    MEMPHIS
          No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I
          heard we got Shaquille ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          Where you been, anyway?

                    MEMPHIS
          Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my
          collection of refrigerator magnets ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          You seem a little hinked-up ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Not at all ...

     He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his
     coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I remember us having made some
          kind of deal, Randall. I don't
          remember this deal having some kind
          of time-limit. I look at you -
          here - in my town - and I'm
          confused...

                    MEMPHIS
          A little family emergency --

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I hope it's not your dear sweet
          mother...

                    MEMPHIS
          No...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Or your baby brother. What was his
          name?

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling.
          Named for the English writer
          of stories about India ...
          He bites into his pear ...
          Memphis says nothing, waits ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
          I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is
          making noise. We recovered a big take -
          last week...

                    MEMPHIS
          And this has what to do with me?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I don't know. But you shouldn't
          be here. Take care of your business.
          I'll give you 24 hours. And
          then I don't want to see your face.
          Ever again. Make a fool of me
          once, that's my bad. Make a fool of
          me twice. That's really my
          bad, and I'll kick your ass from
          here to India ...

     Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Good. Cos you know how it plays.
          Six years ago, I let you go free. But
          the next time ... The next time sends
          you away for'a long, long while ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          By the time you get out, asshole, there
          won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin'
          around in space ships ...

     He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ...
     once they're gone... He walks ...

     EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT

     Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

                    TOBY
          You goin' home?

                    KIP
          Yeah... You want a ride...

                    TOBY
          Sure -

                    KIP
          How'd you get here? Your Moms give you
          ride -- ?

                    TOBY
          Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

                    KIP
          You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

                    TOBY
          I dunno. It was right here. Someone
          musta' boosted it back...

                    KIP
          Damn crooks is everywhere --

     They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

                    TOBY (cont'd)
          Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with
          them clothes? He a farmer now or
          something?

     And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

                    KIP 
          Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing
          is old...

     And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the
     wall...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          What do you want -- ?

     One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip
     strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

                    KIP
          Don't you do that! You leave him alone!

                    GOON
          Shaddup, Raines

                    KIP
          He's got nothing to do with this --

     And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

                    GOON
          Get him in the car

     EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

     Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans
     Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

                    CALITRI
          Hello, Kip --

     Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

                    KIP
          Lemme out of this --

                    CALITRI
          Were it only that easy --

                    KIP
          We can still do it --

     Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit
     ... Kip is close to scrunch ...

                    CALITRI
          No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you
          remind me of. Because just being attracted
          to something, doesn't mean you belong...

     INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

     Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's
     miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

     EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

     Kip continues to struggle free...

                    KIP
          Listen, Calitri --

                    CALITRI
          Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me
          "asshole." Cos that's how you've
          treated me --

                    KIP
          I get out of this I'm gonna fuck
          you up --

     Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another
     nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          Calitri -- !

     Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the
     side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there
     is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its
     origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

     We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is
     maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT 
     INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

     And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
     the harbor, we CUT TO:

     INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

     Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's
     making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his
     mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

     And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of
     he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

     When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a
     window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.
     Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

     Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's
     Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip -- ?

                    KIP
          Yeah ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You all right -- ?

                    KIP
          I think so. There's things I can't
          feel right now. Like my feet. But ...
          You think you can get me outta this,
          Memphis? I'd appreciate it -

                    MEMPHIS
          Just hold-on there --

     Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene
     TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets
     to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          So you want to run that part by me
          again about things being "all
          sweetness and light..."

                    KIP
          This has nothing to do with any
          of that --

                    MEMPHIS
          Oh. You maybe have more than one
          enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?

                    KIP
          All my enemies own car crushers. 
          It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

                    MEMPHIS
          Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost
          there...

     Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage
     ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of
     contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
     ...

     INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

     Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,
     Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering
     Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen
     TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed
     Boston Celtic fast-break...

     Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of
     the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined
     MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks
     slightly ridiculous...

     Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's
     seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the
     inevitable crack...

                    MEMPHIS
          You okay -- ?

                    KIP
          Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer,
          man -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Sure --

     And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two
     beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

                    KIP
          you like Kobe's game? I do. You
          think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do.
          He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's
          got that going for him --

     And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel
     ... Presses it to his head --

                    MEMPHIS
          You sure you're okay -- ?

                    KIP
          Yeah, man. Where is your beer?

     Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS
     on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip
     it...

                    KIP
          Cool. So you're living up North?

                    MEMPHIS
          Yeah -

                    KIP
          I heard you were pumping gas -

                    MEMPHIS
          Something like that -

                    KIP
          You're kind of cultivating a new look.

                    MEMPHIS
          Yeah --

     Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel
     with another ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Maybe you need a stitch --

                    KIP
          Nah. It's a scratch.

                    MEMPHIS
          Okay --

     Beat ...

                    KIP
          Hey, you want something to eat ?

                    MEMPHIS
          What do you got ... ?

     And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the
     'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at
     cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

                    KIP
          Not much. I got olives. You like
          olives?
          Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes
          the Calabrese. It's more mellow

     And he brings over a bowl of olives.

                    MEMPHIS
          There's certainly a time and a place
          for a mellow olive -

                    KIP
          Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

     And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice
     stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an
     appreciative nod...

     And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an
     ashtray... Then:

                    MEMPHIS
          So what are you gonna do?

                    KIP
          About what?

                    MEMPHIS
          "About what?"

                    KIP
          About Calitri? No worries, man.
          I'll call him. He's a reasonable
          dude ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I can see that -

     And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip
     catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          You have everything ... under
          control?

                    KIP
          Yeah. He just wants to know I'm
          still on it. He needs reassurance.
          All these big swinging dicks do.
          No worries. I won't let him get
          into our Kool-Aid...

     Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of
     the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring
     at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          What -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          What happened to you?

                    KIP
          What?

     And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

                    MEMPHIS
          You just got crushed in a car. You're
          bleeding all over your self. And you
          sit there - eating olives and talking
          basketball, as if, at this very
          moment, people weren't plotting
          your demise ...

                    KIP
          C'mon, man... My "demise..."
               (chuckles)
          Overreaction

                    MEMPHIS
          "Over--"  You know - I can maybe
          understand, since I been gone, you
          taking up this dumb-ass life of
          crime, and for that I can partly
          blame myself. But what is baffling
          to me, is how, since I been gone,
          you've become a complete and total
          moron--

                    KIP
          Hey, now -

                    MEMPHIS
          He's gonna kill you -- !

                    KIP
          I can handle it --

                    MEMPHIS
          You can handle it?

                    KIP
          I can handle it --

                    MEMPHIS
          You can handle it?

                    KIP
          I can handle it --

                    MEMPHIS
          You?

                    KIP
          Me.

                    MEMPHIS
          You?

                    KIP
          Me...

     Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this
     hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the 
     window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

                    KIP (cont'd)
          Why? You think you can help me?

     And he turns back to Kip ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          What can you do? You haven't done
          anything in six years but pump gas 
          and go overall shopping. And 
          the cars, they've changed ...
          There's new shit. Computer chip
          keys and sophisticated alarms and
          I don't think, an old guy, could much
          bypass 'em...

                    MEMPHIS
          You don't think so, huh?

                    KIP
          Not really ... But you know... Maybe
          I'm wrong ...

     And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the
     TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

     EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

     A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

     Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial
     fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and
     bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel
     and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean
     and fillet ...

     As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS
     ... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel
     ... Everyone seems to know him...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?

     An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several
     steaks...

                    FISHERMAN
          Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          You can't get it any fresher than this,
          Memphis ... From the sea to my
          skillet ... Nothing in between...

                    MEMPHIS
          What's with the fish thing -- ?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          We can learn something from our Asian
          friends. They smoke a thousand
          cigarettes a day; they're completely
          stressed and overworked; they drink
          like, well ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Fish.

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          And they still have the lowest rate of
          cancer of anywhere in the world. You
          know why? All they eat is seafood.

                    MEMPHIS
          Also, never underestimate the restorative
          powers of "Karaoke."

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          I do a poaching number. Six-ounce
          fillets in a saucepan of brine. In
          8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn
          wedding. Plain but flavorful. And
          it's a good way to show off my
          Hollandaise sauce ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          I do ...
               (laughs)
          Christ, what happened to us ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Speak for yourself, boss I don't
          have a Hollandaise sauce

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          No, but you dress like an asshole ...

     They walk...

                    MEMPHIS
          I think about that night a lot...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Me, too. Every time I walk...

                    MEMPHIS
          How they were just there ... Waiting on
          us ... The fix was definitely in ...

     Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Yeah, you know: I just. I just
          never really thanked-you. I meant
          to. I just want you to
          know...

     Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut
     filets.

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Tell him it's on ...

     Atley looks at him...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Yeah -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and
          them Tell him it's on

     Atley nods...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Any idea how you're gonna go at it?

     Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

     As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

     EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

     The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
     operation ...

     Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
     orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette
     as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
     and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is
     stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
     brazed...

     All under the watchful eye of...

     OTTO HALLIWELL

     Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
     question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
     Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

     But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
     and can be ...

     His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

     Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN
     on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he
     is an artist ...

     His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
     dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

     Memphis wanders in...

     Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis
     ... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes
     him a few steps ...

     Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
     through ...

                    OTTO
          Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life
          returning to bid a final farewell?
               (holds him at arm's length)
          And have my angels completely lost
          their fashion sense -- ?
               
                    MEMPHIS
          Hello, Otto ...

                    OTTO
          You remember Junie?

                    MEMPHIS
          Of course. Hi, Junie --

                    JUNIE
          Hello, Memphis -

                    MEMPHIS
          What happened here -- ?

                    OTTO
          Whatever do you mean?

                    MEMPHIS
          The chop-shop... Where are the stripped
          cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The
          part bins?

                    OTTO
          What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of
          killing them. I woke up one morning and thought
          I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of
          resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.
          There are so few things in this life, we can
          prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't
          have to...

     He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

                    OTTO (cont'd)
          It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
          acrylic lacquer before laying out the
          flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar
          flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ...
               (turns to Memphis)
          Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look
          splendid ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You, too, Otto

     And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

                    OTTO
          I heard rumors you were back. About
          Kip ...

                    MEMPHIS
          He's gotten involved --

     Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

                    OTTO (O.S.)
          I can't concentrate. Play something, my
          sweetness; my reason to rise ...

     And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE
     SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as
     if it were a Mahler symphony...

                    OTTO (cont'd)
          The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le
          Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear
          how they got the engine up?
          Hear those exhaust notes? That's a
          very wide rev range... Here, it
          peaks at 5500 RPM...

     Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

                    OTTO (cont'd)
          Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much
          sorrow on these streets ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You think it can be done?

                    OTTO
          Are you considering a comeback tour?

                    MEMPHIS
          Tell me...

                    OTTO
          It can be done. Take two days to shop;
          one to prep. I'll offer up my bible
          for a small fee. You also have to
          hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
          Castlebeck's linkage so much so
          that he's setting up surveillance
          teams on every city block. And
          then get yourself a crew...

                    MEMPHIS
          The hard part ...

                    OTTO
          "A people is a detour of nature to
          get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then
          to get around them..." Nietzsche said
          that.

                    MEMPHIS
          Is he still working here ?

                    OTTO
          The old crew. Go find them. I can't
          help you with that. Since I've cleaned
          up the act a bit, they no longer come
          around... A pity how legitimacy makes
          you unpopular -

                    MEMPHIS
          I Just don't know how happy they'll be
          to see me

     Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

                    OTTO
          I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal.
          worst car ever built. Value job.
          Everything broke and I-fixed it.
          A coma car - built to German specs.
          Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
          On a quiet night, you could hear it
          rusting in the garage. But when that
          car was gone, I missed it. If it came
          driving back in here right now,
          there'd be tears and laughter ...

                    MEMPHIS
          And the moral of that story is -- ?

                    OTTO
          Go to them. They'll be happy to see
          you ... Ahhh...

     And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

                    OTTO (cont'd)
          ... 8.8:1 compression...

     We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON: A SIGN READING: "PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL"

     atop a moving DODGE ARIES K. Which is nearly SIDE-SWIPED by an
     oncoming PICK-UP. A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...

     INT. DODGE - MOVING - CITY STREETS - DAY

     A timid CHINESE GIRL - JENNY, 23 - negotiates the vehicle at
     10 & 2. Riding shotgun, her howling instructor is DONNY ASTRICKY - 41,
     whom we remember from six years ago. Now he's paunchy, with Ernie
     Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the 
     jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

     Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Put it in PARK. Remember how
          to do that? It's the big "Pff.

     She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          "Objects May Appear Closer
          Than They Seem." Can you say
          that for me?

                    JENNY
          I'm sorry.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          You ain't sorry. You're a horrible
          driver... You can't strap into
          your seat belt, without almost
          getting creamed by a bus ...

     She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal.
          You can't drive. You can't.
          Time to acknowledge it and move on. I
          can't swim. I know I can't. So you
          know what I do? I stay the fuck outta
          the pool ...

     EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

     Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.
     Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

                    MEMPHIS
          How you doing, man?

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          All I get are the Orientals. They can
          build 'em, but they can't drive
          'em So? What are you doing here?
          What's with the outfit -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          You know where the others are?

     Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are
          doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro
          and Frankie Fish are moving
          weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was
          killed in Denver... Atley
          Jackson's on the gimp and runnin'
          errands for Calitri; The Sphinx
          is still around, I guess ... Then
          of course, there's ...

     His pause is meaningful ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Forget that ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this
          about anyways -- ?

     INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

     In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis
     and Donny sit... With the list before them...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Most of 'em are late-model...

                    MEMPHIS
          That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          We'll have to start beating the
          bushes, find out where they live...

     Otto enters. Giggles...

                    OTTO
          Some crew you got ...

                    MEMPHIS
          If we put out the word. That we're
          crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
          What do you think that'll yield?

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
          up men. This ain't like the old days,
          Memphis. The profession has lost its..

                    OTTO
          Dignity...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Yeah...

                    MEMPHIS
          Well, the three of us don't'exactly
          inspire confidence...

     Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          I know. Weird, huh -- ?

     The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

                    WORKER
          Otto, there's someone here to --

     But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Lookit Kip. All grown up...

                    KIP
          Hey, Donny --

                    MEMPHIS
          What are you doing here?

                    KIP
          Otto called -

     Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

                    OTTO
          You need him...

                    MEMPHIS
          No we don't -

                    OTTO
          I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis.
          But how are two washed-up thieves
          and an old man supposed to boost
          50 cars in three days...

                    MEMPHIS
          His criminal career has officially come
          to a close ...

                    OTTO
          The conundrum still applies, of course. The
          purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
          baby brother from imminent
          death and/or a life of crime. However.
          This cannot be successfully
          carried out without baby brother's
          considerable resources, shabby
          though they may be.

     Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

                    MEMPHIS
          We do this. Then. You're finished.
          Then. You're clean

                    KIP
          I like how you wallop back in here -
          after four years - and can still get all
          Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You hear me?

                    KIP
          I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll
          move to the country. Open a fruit
          stand...

     Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          You guys have any skills at all?

                    KIP
          Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is
          our electronics expert. He's got
          some gadgets you old farts maybe
          never -heard of; Tumbler can drive
          anything with wheels, and some
          things without; Toby's a hacker,
          can do things with a computer, that
          are pretty amazing ...

                    MEMPHIS
          How old are you now, Toby?

                    TOBY
          Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven
          months ...

     Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY 
               (re: Freb)
          What about him?

                    KIP
          Freb can order pizzas like nobody's
          business

     Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

                    FREB
          People gotta eat ...

     Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

                    MEMPHIS
          Okay, then... Otto?

                    OTTO
          In order to succeed, you're going
          to have to go old-school. one night
          boost. Put all your nuts in one basket.
          And...

                    TUMBLER
          One night? Are you nuts?

                    MEMPHIS
          You got maybe a better plan?

     Tumbler looks to Kip...

                    KIP
          You spread it out ... you move around...
          So's they can't touch you... so's they
          don't know... Shadow games and shit
          ...

                    MEMPHIS
          "Shadow games?"

                    KIP
          Shadow games ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You spread it out, by the 2nd night,
          the heat are onto you. Know
          something's up. With a one-night boost,
          by the time all the cars are reported
          stolen, your ship's set sail.

     Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Go on, Otto -

                    OTTO
          We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to
          shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still
          going to need to expand the crew...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          There's no one left ...

                    OTTO
          We've got several Italian cars on the list.
          Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So
          we're gonna need a specialist ...

     Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

                    MIRROR MAN 
               (to Otto)
          You know of one -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

     So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

     INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

     A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a
     mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.
     Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

                    DRUNK
          One more, girl -

     The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily 
     tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison
     song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She
     collects the Drunk's empty glass...

                    SWAY
          I think you've had enough, Billy...

                    DRUNK
          Enough? I haven't even started, girl.
          Gimme another --

                    SWAY
          If you leave now, Billy, you can get
          a head-start on waking up in a pool
          of your own vomit...

                    DRUNK
          Listen, you little cooze--

     And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And
     Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...
     And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And
     drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of
     "Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

     EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

     Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

                    SWAY
          Come back when you've learned how to
          drink, Billy --

     And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She
     looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

                    MEMPHIS
          See you're still stealing the sailors from
          the sea --

                    SWAY
          What are you doing here?

     And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

     INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

     They head toward the bar...

                    SWAY
               (re: his clothes)
          What's with the look?

                    MEMPHIS
          The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
          old...

                    SWAY
          You look like you lost your sheep ...

     And she hops back behind the bar ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?

                    SWAY
          Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in
          here ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Buy you a drink?

                    SWAY
          Nope. I got a coffee. And a
          boyfriend.

     She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves
     back. Memphis frowns.

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          Mitch.

                    MEMPHIS
          "Mitch?"

                    SWAY
          Mitch.

                    MEMPHIS
          So I was replaced by Mitch?

                    SWAY
          No. You were replaced by Alex.
          Who was replaced by Kevin. Who
          was replaced by Vince. Who was
          replaced by Mitch...

     She smiles sourly at him...

                    MEMPHIS
          Wow. And to think all I
          accomplished these past six
          years was the "LORD OF THE
          RINGS" trilogy...

     She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her
     glassware ... Beat ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          You look great --

                    SWAY
          Yeah, well, you always were a sucker
          for flawed existences ...

     ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          You should leave --

                    MEMPHIS
          On account of Mitch?

                    SWAY
          On account of me.

     He studies her... Then:

                    MEMPHIS
          I've taken the spear for a lot of
          people, Sway. Including you. Can't
          we improvise a little here ... ?

                    SWAY
          No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ...
          You left me, remember?

                    MEMPHIS
          I left town. I didn't leave you.

                    SWAY
          A distinction worth noting ...

                    MEMPHIS
          And here I am...

                    SWAY
          Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on
          account of any longing-for-my-touch
          on your part -

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip's in trouble

     And now she looks concerned

                    SWAY
          What kind of trouble -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks.
          Only the two weeks have turned into four
          days. And not a single lady has been
          snared.

                    SWAY
          And you got some Italians -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Six or seven...

                    SWAY
          I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't
          for a while. I've carved out something
          for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I understand -

     And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

                    MITCH
          Another round, Sara -

                    SWAY
          Sure, Mitch -

     And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

                    MITCH
          How you doing, pal?

     Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

                    MITCH (cont'd)
          She's hot, right?

                    MEMPHIS
          I'd go so far as to say "lovely."

     And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

                    MITCH
          You should her face when she's having
          sex --

     And Memphis turns to him...

                    MEMPHIS
          Really?

                    MITCH
          Really...

                    MEMPHIS
          What's it look like?

     And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.
     Mitch's face curls ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
          face? Agonized and writhing and ugly?
          Oh, now I see it, yes, yes!

     And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway
     comes over ...

                    SWAY
          What the hell are you doing -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          If you change your mind. We're at
          Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
          For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's
          life on the felt. So long now ...

     And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

                    MITCH
          Who was that guy, Sara?

     She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

                    SWAY
          Good question ...

     INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

     Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...
     Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

                    TUMBLER
          Freb's here. Open the gate.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
               (to Otto)
          We sent him out on a solo boost. See
          what he could do ...

     Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

                    FREB
          How do I look in this one?

                    MIRROR MAN
          Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          How'd it go?

                    FREB
          Keys were in it ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Well, that defies the point, don't it?

                    MIRROR MAN
          You should ask him how he got the name
          "Freb."

                    FREB
          Shaddup, man ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Get the damn thing in there and get it
          cleaned up -

     Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

                    KIP
          This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.

     He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
     Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          Holy shit ...

     It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Lemme see that -

     He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Heroin.

                    KIP
          No shit?

     And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO
     DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          There's gotta be a million bucks worth
          here -

                    TUMBLER
          We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!

                    MEMPHIS
          Where'd you pick her up?

                    FREB
          In front of one of them poker parlors in
          Chinatown ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Well, take it back --

                    KIP
          Take it back? What do you mean take
          it back? Are you crazy, man?


                    MEMPHIS
          Take it back, Freb --

                    MIRROR MAN
          Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

     Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
     holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
     Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          Now, see what you--

     But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

                    OTTO
          Who is it -- ?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.)
          Castlebeck.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

                    OTTO
          one minute -- !

     And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
     devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

     Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
     Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
     there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
     the Caddy ... But there's no time...

     For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I know you.

                    MEMPHIS
          You know my back.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          What are you still doing here,
          Randall?

                    MEMPHIS
          Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

     Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around
     the garage... Taking it all in...

     Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          What's this -- ?

                    OTTO
          Cadillac.

     ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          What's wrong with it -- ?

                    OTTO
          Needs brightening ...

     Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

     He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
     smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

                    OTTO
          No faith in our new-found goodness,
          Detective ...?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Sure. But sometimes we got to
          create some numbers. The task force
          is run by statistics, you know ...

     Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

                    RADIO (O.S.)
          329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
          this time...

     Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
     at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

                    MEMPHIS
          You're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
          But they probably stripped its guts and
          crated 'em up, right ... ?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Something like that -

     Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
     ... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Let her rip ...

     And Castlebeck starts the car...

     ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
     away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
     satisfied ... Gets out.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Okay, then. I'll catch you later,
          Randall ...

                    OTTO
          Double-meaning intended, right?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Right ...

     Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          It's funny. There's probably been
          five more cars stolen in the time
          I've been here ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I don't think so, Detective ...

     And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The
     others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping
     the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Take her back to where you found her,
          Freb --

     INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is
     at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes
     home ... Hangs up his coat ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Hey -

     He kisses her head ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Kip -

     Kip nods ... Plays on ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          What do you got there?

                    HELEN RAINES
          The photo album. I get nostalgic around
          this time of year ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What time of year?

                    HELEN RAINES
          Tuesdays ...

     He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

     PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;
     Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old
     Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN
     with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass
     442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost
     feel his strong, sure presence ...

     Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

                    MEMPHIS
          You ever wonder what things'd be like
          if he hadn't died?

                    HELEN RAINES
          Every day. I wonder about that every day...

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip and I'd probably be working at the
          dealership...
               (to Kip)
          Imagine us selling cars?

     Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to
     his Mother ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Imagine that -- ?

                    HELEN RAINES
               (salesman voice)
          And just in case you lose your keys, good
          sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim,
          free of charge ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Mother -- !

     They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          I remember, every day, he'd come home
          in a different car.
          That was the greatest thing ... And
          we'd climb all over it ... Examine
          every inch of every different
          car ...

                    HELEN RAINES
          I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you
          two are out there heads under hoods ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You remember that, Kip?

                    KIP
          I was six ...

     Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

                    MEMPHIS
          After he died ... I think that's
          what I missed most of all ... That
          there was no different cars every night ...
          When I started hanging around Otto's ...
          And he started showing me the things ...
          It was a way to kill two birds ...
          Put food on the table for you and Kip ...
          And ... Ride in different cars every
          night ... Just like when Dad was here.

     Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

                    KIP
          Ancient history's two things.
          "Ancient." And "history!"

     And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis
     turns to his mother ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.

                    HELEN RAINES 
          I know...

                    MEMPHIS
          We do it. He'll get clear Once and
          for all 

     And she nods ...

     ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

     EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

     The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and
     Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the 
     rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost.
          No skill. No finesse. Can only take
          the car if the key is in it. That's
          not thieving. That's parking ...
          Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...

                    TOBY
          They're just cars, man ...

     To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in
     with:

                    MEMPHIS
          This Eleanor's been living at the
          International Towers for 3 years now.

                    TOBY
          Who's "Eleanor?"

                    MEMPHIS
          The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.

                    TOBY
          Why do you call it "Eleanor?"

                    MEMPHIS
          All the vehicles get code names.
          Female names. You say "Eleanor lives
          at such and such... " and no one
          listening on the waves is the wiser ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."

                    MEMPHIS
          And there she is --

     Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with
     black top ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Hello, Eleanor --

     And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

                    TOBY
          It looks just like a regular Mustang --

                    KIP
          Don't go there, Toby --

                    MEMPHIS
          She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the
          Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine
          and got it legally rated for the street
          at 450 horsepower ... But its actual
          output is closer to 600 ...

                    TOBY
          So she flies -

                    MEMPHIS
          She soars -

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Grade-A unicorn ...

                    TOBY
          What's a "unicorn?"

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Fabled creature. You know - the horse
          with the horn? Impossible to capture?

     Toby looks blank ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          We all got one. The single car
          that, no matter how many times
          you try to boost, something happens...
          Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner
          comes back. It's voodoo...

                    TOBY
          You guys and the car thing, man --

     They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

                    MEMPHIS
          See you in a few days, Eleanor --

     INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

     To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA
     and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a
     series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

     Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler
     puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-
     jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
     pointy leads ...

     - Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized
     DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

                    MIRROR MAN
          And you just stick it in the lock.
          Hit this little button ... And ...

     He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak
     chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

                    OTTO
          We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ...
               (to Mirror Man)
          Can I try -- ?

                    MIRROR MAN
          Knock yourself out --

     Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

                    TOBY
          I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site,
          right? Then I monitored their
          incoming outside data requests,
          right? Then I got these ISDN numbers,
          right? Then I tracked them back,
          right? Then I took the one I could
          jack-up the easiest, right? Then I
          called back see, they think I'm an
          insurance company - that's where it
          looks like I'm coming from -- and
          they're sharing stats with this
          insurance company, right? So now
          they're sharing it with me, right?
          They think I'm looking for stats for
          an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
          So they let me in, right? Give me all
          these numbers. But then I don't leave,
          right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I
          just go anywhere I want.

                    MEMPHIS
          So what's in there -- ?

                    TOBY
          I can tell you who's gonna be on duty
          tonight. I can tell you how much gas
          they're using monthly. I can tell you
          how they used to spend that annoying
          half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...

     Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

                    KIP
          Good work, Toby --

     Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start
     it fail...

                    FREB
          It just ain't happening --

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          You'll get the hang of it, kid. You
          just need to remember one thing -

                    FREB
          What's that?

     Donny smiles ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          On boost night? Always take along a
          good mix tape ...

     Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          You bring a woman back to your
          crib for some lovemaking, the
          song you put on, depends on the
          woman, the type of lovemaking you
          intend to do, right?

                    FREB
          I guess ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          You got a school teacher or Nancy from
          accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone
          or James Brown. You put on
          Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got
          some wild one you just picked
          up at the track, you wouldn't put on
          Cat Stevens or James Taylor.
          You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.
          Or, if you really wanted to
          get after it: Miles.

                    FREB
          okay ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          It's the same way with cars. Different
          cars. Different tunes. You can't steal
          a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You
          gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny
          Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that
          shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman
          Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could
          lead to disaster. Got it... ?

                    FREB
               (absolutely hasn't got it)
          Got it ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Good.

     And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out
          and got some big game ... Hello, Sway.
          I was just telling the lads about mix
          tapes --

                    SWAY
               (to Freb)

     Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

          I've missed you, Sara Wayland --

                    SWAY
          Good to see ya, Otto --

     They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

                    KIP
          How ya doing, Sway -- ?

                    SWAY
          Kip...

     She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          What do you think about all this?

                    SWAY
          Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's
          Errand", right -- ?

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          That's my girl --

                    MEMPHIS
          That's Mirror Man ... And that's
          Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ...
          Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They
          call her "Sway."

                    SWAY
          Hey -

     But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...
     Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          No questions. I'm here. I need the
          dough.

                    MEMPHIS
          Of course ...

     She studies him... Nods ...

                    SWAY
          Good. Just so we understand...

     And then she sees something at the entrance ...

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          Oh, shit. You didn't --

     He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked
     in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is
     a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

     THE SPHINX

     And the others really don't dig his scene ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Well, well, well. The original crash
          test dummy...

     The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
     Freb whispers to Otto ...

                    FREB
          Who's that -- ?

                    OTTO
          That's The Sphinx.

                    FREB 
          The Sphinx?

                    OTTO
          He never says a word. And he's got
          a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx.
          He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like
          time ...
               (to The Sphinx)
          Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !

     And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand
     around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday.

          myself 

                    SWAY
          She was the only "Annie" you could find?

                    MEMPHIS
          They only made a handful. We're lucky
          there's even one living in the area...

                    SWAY
          Yeah, well ... She lives with District
          Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

     As she speaks we CUT TO:

     EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

     A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy
     neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed
     lawn.

                    SWAY (O.S.)
          ... and he keeps "Annie' in his
          living room... Like a work of art ...

     INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

     Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall
     ... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a
     platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his
     late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex
     system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
     ...

                    SWAY (O.S.)
          She's got 27 miles on her o-dom.
          Which is exactly how far away the
          custom shop was in 1979 when he
          bought her... He drove her home,
          never drove her again ...

     The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod
     taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service
     ... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch
     as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

                    SWAY (O.S.)
          The man's a freak...

     INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

     Sway looks at Memphis ...

                    SWAY
          She's trouble --

                    MEMPHIS
          I put the boys on it. They're clever
          that way...

     She nods ... Long look ...

                    SWAY
          I go with you --

                    MEMPHIS
          That what you want?

                    SWAY
          That's what I want ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Okay.

     She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her
     hands ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          I missed you, you know -

                    SWAY
          You mentioned that in your letters 

                    MEMPHIS
          I always thought you'd follow me up.

     She shuts off the taps ... Towels her hands...

                    SWAY
          We were good when you bailed, weren't we?

                    MEMPHIS
          Very good...

                    SWAY
          Cos there were those dark days, when
          I figured - my God, how easy it was
          for him to just give it up; to make the
          deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
          And give me up in the process.

                    MEMPHIS
          No way ...

                    SWAY
          No ... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          No ...

     And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared
     towel into it ...

                    SWAY
          Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me,
          Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and
          you're the jim that did the leaving. So
          save the sanctimonious shit for someone
          who believes. The only reason I ride with
          you, is cause I don't want to spend the
          whole night with any of them other creeps!

                    MEMPHIS
          Oh. Okay. Right.

     EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

     Memphis walks out... Going over to the PARKED CAR across the
     street ... Castlebeck...

                    MEMPHIS
          I'm on the move -

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Your girl works in there ...

                    MEMPHIS 
          Not my girl anymore

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Yet your still here ... I gave
          you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What do you want from me?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Honestly? I want to - once every
          few months - get into my car. Pack
          a lunch. And drive on up to Chino.
          On visiting day. Bring you some
          magazines. Maybe some almond clusters.
          And see you all bright and shiny in
          your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...

     And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing
     after him...

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last
     coming to:

     EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

     A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the
     chain-fence out front.

     And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan
     CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

                    MEMPHIS
          This one ...

     He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild
     whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it
     off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

     Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds
     a little DEVICE.

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          What's that thing -- ?

                    KIP
          Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little
          something the R & D department came up with ...

                    MEMPHIS
          How long were you gonna let me try and
          stop it...?

                    KIP
          After a while, it became a little pathetic ...
          Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Thank-you ...

                    KIP
          De nada ...

     He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping
     stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

                    MEMPHIS
          Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

                    KIP
          The family that steals together, deals
          together...

                    MEMPHIS
          Dad'd be proud --

                    KIP
          Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

                    MEMPHIS
          What era was that -- ?

                    KIP
          The era when crime didn't pay --

                    MEMPHIS
          As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?

                    KIP
          Price of doing business...

                    MEMPHIS
          What about just getting a job, 9 to 5,
          five days a week, that whole mystery
          achievement -- ?

                    KIP
          It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows,
          Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we
          make mad bank, my boys are down, the
          girlies come around and the boosts are
          a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get
          jacked-up every now and then - but ain't
          that a small price to pay for never,
          never-ever, having to say "paper or
          plastic?"

     And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

     INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

     The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis
     and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

     Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...
     To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED
     CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

                    MEMPHIS
          We've got to shake them tomorrow
          night. I'm making that your problem.
          That's called delegation of duties.
          You like it -- ?

     Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Sure, man --

     And they follow him back into the garage ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each
          team has been assigned their ladies.
          The teams are: me and Sway. Donny
          and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror
          Man, you and The Sphinx ... 

     Mirror Man looks horrified ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Aw, c'mon, man ...

     The Sphinx grins at him...

                    TOBY
          What about me?

                    MEMPHIS
          You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto
          abreast of our progress ...

                    TOBY 
          How come ... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Because you should be home with
          Nintendo, listening to The Spice
          Girls, little man ...

                    TOBY
          Come on. Kip, talk to the guy

                    KIP
          There's no talkin' to him --

     And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some
     paper cups ...

                    OTTO
               (cup raised)
          To a safe and successful session of bumping
          fenders and trading paint.

     Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits
     PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.
     ("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

     And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances 
     with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto
     parts ...

                    BEACH BOYS 
          "Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put
          me down But I got the fastest set of wheels
          in town, etc."

     Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's
     fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands
     aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing
     for a bit ...

     And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri
     GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.
     Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The
     Sphinx nod to Atley ...

                    CALITRI
          This is how you're spending my time?
          Having a sock hop?

                    MEMPHIS
          Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the
          community ...

                    CALITRI
          Look at this. A multi-generational gathering
          of scumbags ...

                    OTTO
          So saith the God of Scumbags --

                    CALITRI
          Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no
          cars have yet to be delivered. And there's
          only one more night ...

                    OTTO
          Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I
          wonder, if delivery isn't made?

     Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

                    CALITRI
          With all the free time I've had not
          counting cars as they're loaded onto
          my ship, I've managed to sand the
          cedar inside your box, Kip. This 
          will protect you from the anaerobic
          bacteria, that normally thrives in
          an airless; environment. Thus
          prolonging decay ...

     He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be
     held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Get out of here, Ray --

                    CALITRI
          One more night --

                    MEMPHIS
          Get out --

                    CALITRI
          I hope you know what you're doing. God help
          you if you don't ...

     And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

     crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

     As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE

     INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

     As Memphis goes through some old boxes. At last, he finds what
     he's looking for ... Opens it ... He takes out its contents ...
     His tools, which we remember from the opening ... And then...
     CLOTHING ...

     Drycoff and Hawkings wait in their unmarked ...

                    DRYCOFF

     He lights another cigarette ... The ashtray is overflowing.

                    HAWKINGS
          How much can one man smoke?

                    DRYCOFF
          It's a crime, ain't it? Cos
          Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over
          this guy, I gotta get lung cancer ...

     INT. OTTO'S

     Mirror Man and Tumbler are at the window Memphis brought them to
     last night ... Mirror Man has a RADIO TRANSMITTER in his hand...
     Donny comes by ...

                    DONNY
          What are you doing?

                    TUMBLER
          Watch and learn, old-timer --

     As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a
     1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along
     the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

                    DONNY
          The hell are you doing?

                    MIRROR MAN
          Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.

     ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded
     40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...
     At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND
     HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

                    TUMBLER
          The Hemi Has Landed --

                    DONNY
          Big deal. Now what?

                    MIRROR MAN
          What we call: fun and shit.

     And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model
     'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,
     razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction
     away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear
     satisfied ...

                    TUMBLER
          We can go now --

          Department of Water and Power. Could you hold
          please ...

     And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold...
     And they make him wait ... And wait ... Just like the real D.W.P.
     does ... They high-five...

                    TOBY (cont'd)
          Where should we put him?

                    KIP
          He's a Judge. He'll only bite for

     At last, Toby answers ...

                    TOBY
          D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I
          help you?

                    JUDGE CROFT
          I got a message. I live at 1443
          Locklin.

          Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?

                    JUDGE CROFT
          NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.

     Kip can hear his anger ... Whispers:

                    KIP
          Oooh, she's chafed --


                    TOBY
          okay, sir. Let me just get the-order.
          Yes. We'll be doing some work out your
          way. We've got a power leak. And it's
          unsafe. We're moving residences to

          Oh, for God's sake

                    TOBY 
          I know, sir ...

     And Kip pantomimes eating. Toby, at first puzzled, gets it.

                    TOBY (cont'd)
          For the inconvenience we're also
          offering a free breakfast brunch --

          Breakfast brunch -- ?

                    TOBY
          Yes, sir -

     Pause ... They've got him... Thumbs-up ...

                    JUDGE CROFT
          Okay, then ... I just go to the
          Marriott and I'm set ...

                    TOBY
          You've been pre-booked...

          your time. It may not seem like it,
          but the night is long. Long enough.
          Just think slow and think smart...

     EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     The massive seaport, a series of wharves. Commercial SCOWS and
     TUGS beast the black water. We should note the enormous 23,000-
     ton, 627-foot CONTAINER SHIP, swaying in the harbor. And the giant
     shoreside GANTRY CRANE alongside it ...

     INT. WAREHOUSE

     An expansive warehouse surrounded by chain-link fence ... Enormous
     SHIPPING CONTAINERS are here, in which the stolen cars will be
     stored. And cartons and cartons of motor oil.

     A massive FRONT-END-LOADER will transport each container to the
     gantry crane, which will lower it onto the cells in the container
     ships' hold...

     Each team is ready ... Each has a briefcase containing the tools 
     of the trade ... Memphis talks into a two-way RADIO ...

          now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly.
          Think Slow. Any questions?

                    TOBY

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Of the four cars, as each team slaps a tape in their deck:
     1) Kip and Tumbler. The tape is Tupac. They bang fists.
     2) Donny Astricky and Freb ... Donny's playing Miles Davis.
     3) Memphis and Sway ... And Bruce ...

                    SWAY
          Oh, yeah.

     4) Mirror Man and The Sphinx... The Sphinx puts on GLASSES with
     attached FAKE NOSE, to cover his gnarled one ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          You should consider always wearing that,
          boy...

     And he slides his tape into the deck... And, as The Gap Band's
     "Burn Rubber On Me" cranks on the track -

     Our team goes out... Into the night ... Toby watching after
     them... Because they're off ...

     EXT. DESERTED PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Tumbler and Kip park the massive CAR CARRIER here ... Kip is

                    MEMPHIS
          No. Open her ...

     He parks ... Opens the back of the van ... Sway pulls the Mazda
     window ... Gets in ... Ignition-Gizmos her ... The motor now
     running ... Waits ... Memphis gets in next to her... He has a
     STEERING WHEEL with him.

                    SWAY
          What the hell's that -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          A little trick I picked up at the Car
          Thief Retirement Home ...

     He uses his screwdriver to REMOVE four rivets on the Mazda's
     Clubbed steering column ... In seconds, the CLUBBED STEERING WHEEL
     IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel
     he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Let's cruise --

     And they do ... Sway rolls down her window ... Tosses something as
     they drive off -

     ANGLE - THE OLD STEERING WHEEL. "Club" firmly affixed to it. On
     the ground, in the Mazda's old parking place...

     EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - TUMBLER AND KIP

     as they systematize the cars they're responsible for... Tumbler
     drops Kip off by a Porsche ... We recognize it as one of the cars
     Mirror Man cut a key for in the valet scam. Kip selects the key
     from a series of them hooked into his briefcase. He gets out. Keys
     the car. He's in. He's off ...

     TUMBLER - meanwhile, has driven to a Volvo C70... He, too, has the

     All is silent. Chainlink fence topped with swirls of lethal-looking

     Mirror Man goes to the main entry fence doors ... He boltcuts the

     EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

     A Porsche 911 Cabriolet is parked...

     Donny and Freb look at it ...

                    FREB
          Diane 1.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Very good. Think you can get in without
          waking her up -- ?

                    FREB
          Yeah.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          That's an after-market alarm. Can't
          just cut her wires ...

     He pops his briefcase ... Takes out some gear ... Gets out ...
     Moves for Diane 1 ...

     INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Helen Raines is rooting through a crowded closet. At last she
     finds what she's looking for ... A small black boxy DEVICE. She
     goes to the living room. Plugs in the box ...

     It is a POLICE SCANNER... And it immediately starts to pop and caw
     ... Helen sits down ... And listens... Her face clenched with
     worry ...

     EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Mirror Man works the thick steel door ... He's got a sledge and
     center punch... He knocks the knob off with the sledge and then
     goes to work with an ELECTRIC DRILL ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          This is some state-of-the-art shit,
          kid. The drill breaks the sockets,
          which force back the spindle and release
          the lock ...only it doesn't seem to be
          working... And The Sphinx is getting
          impatient ...

     INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING

     Memphis and Sway... They ride in silence ... She busies herself by
     looking through the consul. Comes up with a tube of LIPSTICK. Uses
     the visor mirror to apply it.

                    MEMPHIS
          Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush,
          floral-print dresses?

                    SWAY
          Deodorant.

     And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on
     thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown --

     Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

                    SWAY
          So, you seeing anybody?

                    MEMPHIS
          No. I had a girl. She was great. The
          problem is: great girls come along once
          every ten years. So I gotta wait
          another three years before I can even
          bother to look...

                    SWAY
          She was so great, why'd you leave her?

                    MEMPHIS
          Her parole officer strongly recommended 
          it ...

     She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and
     Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

     EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

     Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's
     own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the
     Porsche ... It's just that he can't figure out how to get her
     started ... The passenger door opens ... Donny...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          What's the matter?

                    FREB
          It's all microchips and shit ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Yeah?

     He holds up a screwdriver. Jams it in the steering column.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          I don't care what kind of car
          it is. How fancy; how expensive;
          how new. You pop the collar -
          it's 1966 all over again ... !

     He pops the collar - exposing an ordinary ignition system.

                    FREB
          Cool ...

     INT. MEMPHIS' VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     Memphis drives ... Sway, Kip, Tumbler with him...

                    KIP
          So we loaded all of the keyed cars up and
          dropped 'em ... It was cake ... 8 cars,
          ba-da-bing ...

     Memphis looks at him in the rear-view ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Having fun, Kip?

                    KIP
          Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...
               (realizes his gaffe)
          I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary,
          it sucks ...

     Memphis looks at Sway, shakes his head... Kills the lights ... And
     they pull in to

     EXT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Where Mirror Man is still struggling with the lock, his drills
     and punches, scattered about ...

                    MIRROR MAN

     only The Sphinx shoves him aside ... Pulls the GUN from his 
     holster and BLANG! blasts open the lock...

     Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Oh, I get it: old school.

     And Memphis and the others drive up ...

                    MEMPHIS
          How's it going?

                    MIRROR MAN
          It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are
          swapping trade secrets ...

     And in they go --

     INT. WAREHOUSE

     Dark as pitch. Flashlights come on. To reveal

     ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

     Old and new models. Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and
     Testarossas. There must be at least fifty of them here.

     Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest
     of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a
     soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

                    SWAY
          It's just... so... beautiful ...

     And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his
     chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace
     ... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the
     first one out --

                    MEMPHIS
          C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can
          you prep 'em -- ?

                    SWAY
          I think so... They're just... So ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I know. But let's prep 'em. We could
          stay here all night... That wouldn't
          be good --

     The others are still gazing ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Let's go, people --

     And they set to work...

     EXT. NIGHT CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Donny Astricky and Freb have accessed a '61 Jag... Watch as Donny
     takes out 3 screws in the Jag's ignition and removes the whole
     thing ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          So? Tell me: how come they call you
          "Freb" anyways -- ?

                    FREB
          C'mon, man ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          We're partners here --

     Freb considers ... Then, reluctantly --

                    FREB
          My names "Fred." You know: Frederick?
          One drunk night, I decided to give
          myself a tattoo. Hot needle it. I
          used a mirror to guide me ...

     And he pulls up his sleeve - to show the blue "FREB" tattooed
     there ...

                    FREB (cont'd)
          The mirror messed me up with the "b" and
          the "d"... Everything's reversed, you
          know? Now, I'm "Freb."

     Donny chooses from a selection of IGNITIONS he's brought along.
     Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...
     Starts the car with his own key ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Glad to know you, "Freberick." Let's
          roll -

     And off they go ...

     INT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE

     Sway sets to prepping the cars ... The others wait nearby. Memphis

          You okay -- ?

                    KIP
          I'm cool.

     Memphis looks at his watch...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          We gonna make it?

                    MEMPHIS
          Too early to tell. Nervous?

                    KIP
          Nah.

                    MEMPHIS
          That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous.
          Everyone's nervous. But not you...

                    KIP
          I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

                    MEMPHIS
          That's a good attitude, Kip. For
          everything but stealing cars ...

     Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty ROAR of Ferrari
     fills the room, as Sway's got one started --

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          This shit's on point. Check it: 200.

     He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH..

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          Halfway there, we switch. I drive.

     He boogies down. The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's
     magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure
     terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

     A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled
     scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and 
     on...

     The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely
     missing an on-coming BUS ... Passing a pair of COPS coming out of
     a 7-11. They hop into their unit. Give chase.

                    SWAY
          They're in love ...

     Long beat ... He looks at her ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What about you?

     She looks at him... Shrugs...

                    SWAY
          You remember my Gramma? Yeah. I was
          thinking. If she were alive. And she
          asked me. If she came down, right now.
          Asked me. "What do you do, Sara?
          What's your life?" Innocently.
          Nonjudgemental. I think it would break
          her heart if I said I was a thief. I
          steal cars, Gramma. And even though,
          hey, I learned it all from her son.
          My Uncle Eddie. Who taught me the basics. 
          Which you refined. (You remember Randall,
          Gramma? You thought he was neat. Well,
          he refined the basics ... ). I don't
          think that's what she hoped for me...

     She looks at him ...

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          But ... That said... Car thieves are my
          weakness ... It's all so terribly Loretta
          Lynn or something, I know... But ... I
          don't wanna be a thief anymore ... I don't
          wanna love a thief anymore ... I want to
          wear a dress maybe once in a while... Maybe
          have a kid... Watch a lot of Audrey Hepburn
          movies.. And think about my Gramma without
          also thinking "shame on me. Shame on
          me. Shame on me... "

     She looks at him... He leans into her ... Kisses her... Tentative
     at first ... Then... With urgency...

          It's an epidemic, Rollie ... I'm
          getting reports every five minutes ...

     INT. THE MAZDA - BACK BAY - NIGHT

     As "Little Red Corvette" by Prince warbles on the track... Memphis
     and Sway still kissing... She breaks it for:

                    SWAY
          Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you
          bellying up to my heart again, man, f
          you can't help falling off the stool.
          But he puts his mouth to her ears ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.

     Whispers ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          I approach you. It's quiet. I look
          this way. That. No one around ...

                    SWAY
          Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

                    MEMPHIS
          I take out my slim-jim...

                    SWAY
          Oh, God...

     And yes, this is patently absurd. But it's also oddly sexy.

                    MEMPHIS
          Slip it in ...

                    SWAY
          You're going high-cheese, dude --

                    MEMPHIS
          Unlock your button ...

                    SWAY
          "Unlock my button" ... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          The alarms go off ...

                    SWAY
          Woo-woo-wooooo!

                    MEMPHIS
          I pop your hood; find your siren wires

                    SWAY
          They're factory alarms ... Easy to get
          around... For a man with... Skills...

                    MEMPHIS
          I do ... I cut "em...

                    SWAY
          Cut 'em...

                    MEMPHIS
          Now... I'm in ...

                    SWAY
          Of course you are. You're a
          professional...

                    MEMPHIS
          I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...

                    SWAY
          I bet you say that to all the girls...

                    MEMPHIS
          With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned
          over ...

                    SWAY
          Wrong preposition...

                    MEMPHIS
          Hear you roar ...

                    SWAY
          What about The Club ... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Let me worry about The Club ...

                    SWAY
          No worries ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I've got you floored... We're off ...
          Take the curb... Man, can you corner...
          Know not to get on it ... Momentum
          shift ... Don't get on those brakes
          too hard ... Get her up on her
          tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up...
          Up.

     Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And
     Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to
     here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

                    SWAY
          You're still quite the boost, Randall
          Raines ...
               (he shrugs)
          Except now I've been chopped, and my
          parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven
          to church in South America by some
          Bolivian consulate's wife ...

                    MEMPHIS
          And Tracy's on the move ...

     Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati... And the car has
     rocketed off... Memphis punches the gas,'sending Sway to the floor...

                    SWAY
          Wham, bam, thank-you, Ma'am, point-
          five ...

     CLOSE UP OF THE "SNAKE" LICENSE PLATE as its ass-end fishtails
     like a bastard... The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a 
     half-dozen CRUISERS ...

     INT. COUNTACH - MIRROR MAN

     is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...

                    MIRROR MAN
          What do I do? What do I do? Aw, man.
          He's gonna swallow my shit whole 
          Let's go to a hospital or something!

     But The Sphinx shakes his head. No.

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          C'mon, you creepy no-nosed motherfucker.
          Take me to a hospital!

     Nope. The Sphinx drives on... Into yet another

     DIRECTOR'S CHASE SCENE

     This one even cooler than the last ... And once they've eluded all
     of the police, The Sphinx pulls over to the side of a DARKENED
     STREET...

                    MIRROR MAN
          What are you doing? I'm gonna die!

     The Sphinx leans over... And PINCHES THE SNAKE BEHIND THE BACK OF
     THE HEAD...

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          You tryin' to make him more mad?

     But, miraculously, the snake RELAXES ITS GRIP on Mirror Man... And
     slithers off... To the back of the car ... Where it immediately
     goes back to sleep ... Mirror Man stares at Sphinx, who smiles
     genially. Then:

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
          I never thought it'd be possible:

     Freb and Donny Astricky have gotten "Laura", a '99 Bentley
     started...

                    FREB
          You ever feel bad about any of this?

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take
          from the rich, and give to the needy...

                    FREB
          You mean the poor --

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this
          car!

     And Donny puts her in gear, When a GUN is jammed agains't Donny's
     temple ...

                    JACKER
          Out of the car, bitch, or I blow your

     Donny looks at the jacker... Surprised... It is a KID ... No more
     than 16 ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Are you kidding me -- ?

                    JACKER

                    DONNY ASTRICKY

          Donny-nothin'!

     And he SLAMS OPEN THE DOOR... catching the kid in the balls ...
     And the kid doubles over... Dropping the gun ... Donny gets out of
     the car...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Lazy, disrespectinIf half-assed
          bully. Any asshole can pull a gun ...

     And he starts to kick at the kid ... Beat at him...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          You don't know how to steal a
          car, do ya? So you gotta take
          them when there's already a key
          in them ... And a person in them...
          Scare people ... Intimidate ...
          Little freakin' bully ...

                    FREB
          C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb:
          what's the matter with kids today?

     But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in
     terrifying SLOW-MOTION. He turns ... To see another KID ...
     Scared... At the edge of the road... Gat held high ... And Donny
     drops to the pavement ... And the first Jacker gets to his feet...

     Freb goes to Donny... To his splayed-out body ... SIRENS split the
     night. The jackers run off down the street.

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Get outta here. Get out. Now!

                    FREB
          I can't leave you here, man --

     Freb doesn't know what to do... Donny croaks ...

                    DONNY ASTRICKY
          I'm all right. Been shot before. You
          take me to the hospital, they bust the
          both of us. The cops'll take me. Go!

     And Freb-makes to run off down the street... But --

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Freb -- !

     Freb turns back

                    DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd)
          Take Laura with you, you stupid shit!

     Freb blinks. Nods. Oh, yeah. He climbs into the Bentley Drives off...
     As the CRUISERS pull up around him... And the UNIFORMS getout, guns
     drawn, approaching warily -

     To find Donny Astricky ... Splayed-out on the pavement ...
     Laughing at the moon ... And, as Jimi Hendrix' "Crosstown Traffic"
     BLASTS ON TRACK, we CUT TO:

     of the final series of boosts ...

     1) The Maserati parked and empty. Sway breaches it.
     Expert. They drive off ...

     2) Kip and Tumbler. Clocking a VIPER. They circle it..
     It's loaded with bells and whistles and Clubs and a
     metallic voice that warns: "WARNING: YOU ARE TOO CLOSE THE 
     VEHICLE!" over and over ... Kip shakes his head ...
     Ushers Tumbler back ...

     3) Mirror Man and The Sphinx deliver an Aston Martin to the docks
     ... Watch as it is driven into a container. The container loaded
     by gantry crane, onto the ship, lashed to the deck by overworked
     LONGSHOREMEN...

     4) Helen Raines. Looking out the window. Listening to
     the scanner for word of her boys...

     5) The Big Board. Female names disappearing like dust..

     6) Castlebeck and Drycoff. Cruising the streets.
     Searching ...

     7) Kip and Tumbler return to The Viper. This time, in a RAMP
     TRUCK. They raise the ramp. Tie down the Viper. A drive off with
     it, to be disarmed at a later, safer venue as it continues its
     robotic exhortation of "WARNING. YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE
     VEHICLE."  Over and over again ...

     8) All our teams... Speeding toward us ... In different
     cars ... As the MUSIC FADES and we END MONTAGE

     EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - JUDGE CROFT'S GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT

     Where "Annie" the 137 Roadster lives as an objet d'art.
     FIGURES in the thicket surrounding the property. Memphis,
     Sway, Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx...

     Mirror Man has the mansion's ELECTRICAL BOX opened... He' going
     through the wires ... Cutting alarm, phone, etc.

     Memphis is on the cell phone... Face grim... He hangs up.

                    MEMPHIS
          Donny got shot ... A jacker ...

                    SWAY
          How is he -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...

     Beat ... As they all reflect on this...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          On a brighter note: 47 ladies have
          checked in for their South American
          sea cruise -

     This cheers them slightly. Until, from the electrical box:

                    MIRROR MAN
          Got it -- !

     And the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade ... They
     regard the house for a beat ...

                    SWAY
          Now what -- ?

     No one's quite sure ... They look at the house ... At all that
     glass ... Then Kip walks to their car ...

                    KIP
          Pop the trunk, Tumbler.

                    TUMBLER
          What for -- ?

                    KIP
          I gotta get my tool --

     And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other ...

                    MIRROR MAN
          No way, homes ...

     Too late. The trunk is popped. Kip reaches in. Comes up with, yes,
     another BRICK ... And Kip walks toward the house. Toward the vast
     windows ...

                    MIRROR MAN (cont'd)
               (to Memphis)
          Ya' gotta stop him, man --

     But Kip forges on, indomitable ... Only he passes the huge glass
     windows ... Walking, instead, up to the front door ... And he
     SMASHES the brick down onto the DOORKNOB. Knocking it clean off...
     Looks back at the others with a wink. And enters the house...
     Tumbler runs after him...

     INT. 1443 LOCKLIN

     Kip walks through the dark house ... At last, coming to the living
     room... To "Annie'. He gets behind the wheel ... Her ignition is
     quick work. He's got her started, loud, in the quiet house. She
     coughs a bit; it's been a long time. Tumbler is there...

                    TUMBLER
          Now what -- ?

                    KIP
          Now, we go -

     And he drives her off the platform. Tumbler directs him...

                    TUMBLER
          This way... This way... This...

     Her nose bumps a zillion-dollar VASE, which topples and shatters...

                    TUMBLER (cont'd)
          That way...

     And Tumbler climbs in beside him... Kip drives her around the huge
     living room... And Kip punches the gas ...

     And they drive the Roadster down the hall ... And right through
     the OPEN DOOR... Driving down onto the lawn ... Up to their
     cohorts ...

                    KIP
          See ya back at the ranch, kids -- !

     And off they go ... Vanishing down the street ... The others watch
     after him ... Mirror Man to Memphis:

                    MIRROR MAN
          Gotta tell ya, man: since you been back?
          You've had a real calming influence on
          ol' Kip...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          He'll live. But it means your boy's
          behind it. Astricky was holding a list.
          They just faxed it to us...

     He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the
     last entry...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Let's get out there. And have them
          run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in
          the area ... Find out where they're at.

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          What for?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          You spend enough time down a man's
          throat, you get to know his tonsils.
          Do it ...

     INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     Kip and Tumbler deliver the Roadster. Toby checks it in.

          Any more ...

                    TOBY
          I dunno ...

     And Kip gets on the two-way...

          "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives
          in the suburbs ...

                    KIP
          We'll take it...

                    OTTO (O.S.)
          It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The
          Sphinx...

                    KIP
          We'll take it.

     And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          Later, Toby --

     But Toby's not around...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          Toby?

     No answer... Kip shrugs... And off they go ...

          Checkin' it out

     He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,
     pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip
     parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the
     house...

     And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the
     garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a
     girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...
     Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the
     car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

     Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew
     they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and
     Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,
     envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

                    TOBY
          I got this one...

     And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's
     open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start
     to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares
     at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
               (whispered hiss)
          Get her started, man -- !

     And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

     INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx
     - has returned... The final cars loaded onto the ship ...
     Memphis looks out into the night --

                    MEMPHIS
          C'mon, Kip -

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

     Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the
     suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out.

                    TOBY
          Which way's out, man -- ?

                    TUMBLER
          Shit all looks the same here --

     They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...
     Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...
     Guns drawn...

                    KIP
          Shit ...

                    TUMBLER
          Run it...

     Toby looks to Kip...

                    KIP
          No...

                    TOBY
          What am I supposed to do?

     Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive
     out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the
     windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.
     Into a bank of mailboxes.

     The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,
     switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches
     the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

     INT. "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

     Kip drives like a wild man ... Toby is bleeding something fierce...
     Shot in the chest...

                    TOBY
          Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...

                    KIP
          Just hold on... Hold on ...

                    TUMBLER
          What are we gonna do -- ?

                    KIP
          Hospital.

                    TUMBLER
          We can't do that, dude --

     Kip looks at Tumbler ... They both look at Toby...

     EXT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

     As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... Kip exploding
     out of it ... Getting into the back. Memphis goes to the car, sees
     Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather
     around...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Jesus ...

     Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

                    KIP
          I didn't know... Should we take him to
          a hospital? I didn't know. I didn't.

     Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

                    TOBY
          Kip. Kip. Kip. Tell me: what's
          gonna happen? What's gonna happen?

     But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

                    MEMPHIS
          You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ...
          We'll getcha fixed up...

                    TOBY
          No ... No... No ... Tell me what's
          gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's
          gonna happen?

     The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

                    TOBY (cont'd)
          What's gonna happen? I don't feel ...
          like ... this ... should.... happen ...
          right ... now. I...haven't... done ...
          shit... Tears running down his eyes...

                    KIP
          Shhhhhh, shhhhh ...

     Kip looks to his brother for help ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Call 911 -

                    MIRROR MAN
          Call 'em here -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          DO IT! NOW -- !

     And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes
     out in short staccato bursts ...

                    TOBY
          Kip... Kip... Kip... It doesn't
          feel... It doesn't feel... It doesn't
          feel... good

     He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And
     Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a
     surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs
     for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

     The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...
     Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in
     one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

                    MEMPHIS
          What did I tell you? What? What did
          I tell you?

                    KIP
          I don't know. What -- ?

     And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
     And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

                    MEMPHIS
          Come here --

                    KIP
          What?

                    MEMPHIS
          Come here -

                    KIP
          What?

                    MEMPHIS
          Come here -

     And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms
     around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to
     sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

                    KIP
          I've missed you, man ...

                    MEMPHIS
          I know. I've missed you, too 

     And they hold each other ...

                    KIP
          Toby...

                    MEMPHIS
          I know ...

                    KIP
          Toby...

     And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's
     arms from around him...

                    MEMPHIS
          Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll
          be back ...

     Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He
     strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all
     the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          Give me a ride -- ?

                    SWAY
          Where to -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Kip's not clear yet. We got one more
          to go --

     And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off
     they go ... The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's
     body...

     ANGLE - THE CLIPBOARD. One car left. Eleanor.

     As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU

     EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN

     The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ...

     Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the
     towers in their unmarked...

     Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake
     moustache, wig, necktie ...

                    SWAY
          You okay -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Yeah ... You -- ?

     She nods ... He looks at her ...

                    MEMPHIS (cont'd)
          You should know: walking away from my
          mother, my brother, this town. Was
          hard. Walking away from you. Nearly 
          killed me...

     And she smiles sadly ...

                    SWAY
          I know ...

     She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ...

                    SWAY (cont'd)
          Good luck...

     Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out. 
     As he heads for the Tower garage...

     IN THE UNMARKED

     Drycoff is on the radio ... Binoculars up, on the Escort's license

     He points ... The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage
     ramp ... Brakes ... Waiting for the light ... Castlebeck squints...
     Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream
     of traffic ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (cont'd)
          What do you think -- ?

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Let's see what he's about --

     Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind
     him...

                    MEMPHIS
          Shit ...

     And kicks it into gear...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          Hey, now -- !

     He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible.
     This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the
     easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto
     the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

     Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig
     and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars
     suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,
     storefronts, Harvard Square ...

     Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the
     Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic

     like a demolition derby... As Drycoff/Castlebeck and some 4 SQUAD CARS
     are chasing Memphis around the Plaza ...

     A POLICE CHOPPER has arrived on the scene... Camera out. Memphis
     takes one more spin around the plaza, then sees a

     SHALLOW FLIGHT OF STAIRS by the back entrance to City.Hall. And he
     takes them... CLUMP-KUMP-KA-DUMP-DUMP-DUMP

     And now he's on some of the narrowest streets in Long Beach. He

     block ... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock
     ... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way --

     Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking
     brake -- And the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is
     exactly like our opening) Screeching spin ... It stops inches from
     the road block ...

     Beat ... Thirty squad cars stop behind him ...

                    POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.)
          All units. Pursuit has been
          terminated. Repeat: pursuit has
          been terminated at Harbor Tunnel
          Eastern Terminus --

     Sure it has. Memphis' foot SLAMS ON Eleanor's pedal ... SMASHING
     THROUGH THE ROADBLOCK... Cars and cops flying ... And the Dispatch
     guy is getting pissed.

                    POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.)
          Check that, all units. You guessed it.
          Pursuit has not been terminated. Jesus
          Christ, will you catch this guy?

     EXT. LONG BEACH BRIDGE

     A huge suspension bridge spanning the harbor ... Except that on
     the Long Beach side, therehas been a terrible ACCIDENT ... An
     eleven-car PILE UP ...

                    PARAMEDIC
          This is Rescue 2... We're at a scene of an
          11-car collision with multiple injuries,
          responded to Ladder truck Code 3 ...
          We'll need back-up and The Jaws of Life...

     Paramedics ... RAMP TRUCKS hauling away wrecked cars ... Fire
     engines ... Bloodied VICTIMS ...

     EXT. CITY STREETS - ELEANOR

     takes it on through the vast construction underway here ... And
     here's our money shot: Eleanor. On Route 33. COMING AT US ...
     Followed by, literally, 20 POLICE-CARS ... Could be just about the
     coolest fucking thing we've ever seen... But before we have time
     to gloat:

                    POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.)
          All units. Suspect vehicle has
          left The Harbor Tunnel roadblock...
          State Police advises they have
          a multiple T.A. on the Long Beach
          Bridge... Accident is unrelated
          to Long Beach P.D. pursuit... Repeat
          unrelated to Long Beach P.D. pursuit.
          The area is closed except to
          emergency vehicles. Suspect is headed
          in that direction. Use caution in that
          area. Repeat: use caution in that
          area ...

     THE LONG BEACH BRIDGE

     Southbound traffic on the bridge (into Long Beach) is at a 
     stand-still because of the accident... The Northbound side of the bridge
     is EMPTY... Northbound traffic stopped at the accident ...

     Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident ... There is
     no way past it, onto the bridge ... All the cops behind him come
     to a screeching halt. He is truly trapped.

     DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

     is thrilled ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          Gotcha now, dickhead --

     But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So
     does

     MEMPHIS

     Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange
     SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ...

     QUICK CUTS TO --

     -- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in
     his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper
     cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men --
     Castlebeck and Drycoff... BACK TO

     MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR...

     Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches
     the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight
     for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further
     injure the accident victims -

     Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for

     THE RAMP TRUCK

     parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets
     Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp
     LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER
     THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ...

                    DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
          You gotta be fucking kidding me --

     Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the
     Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang
     at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the
     scene ...

     Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis
     switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson
     Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge,
     the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ...

     INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY

     A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing
     cards.

     INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP

     The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ...
     Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a
     plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to

     THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS

     has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up,
     entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55
     AM...

                    CALITRI
          Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

                    MEMPHIS
          This is number 50. We did it. It's
          over Where's the money ?

                    CALITRI
          Right there -

     He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's
     a lot of cash inside...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          200 K. Just like we said ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You should never have gotten my brother and
          his friends involved ...

                    CALITRI
          But I had to. It was the only way to
          get to you --

     Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

                    MEMPHIS 
          Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away
          from him...

                    CALITRI
          I don't know about that, Randall.
          He did such a good job on this paper.
          And another one just came in ...

     Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two
          weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to
          Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?

                    MEMPHIS
          You don't want to even sniff at that --

     Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the
     first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she
     is smashed-to-shit.

                    CALITRI
          Well, that certainly won't do.

                    MEMPHIS
          What do you mean -- ?

                    CALITRI
          Look at it. I can't very well make
          delivery of that thing ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You got no choice. It's over.

                    CALITRI
          Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM
          Friday. Or Kip goes in that box.
          That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...
          That was the deal ...

     Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR
     rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

                    CALITRI (cont'd)
          What are you doing -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not
          gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...

     And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and
     groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw
     drowning out the sounds of combat ...

     Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the
     lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's
     wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

     ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last
     gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a
     small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl
     akimbo ...

     Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself
     out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

     He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on
     the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair
     and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into
     the floor ...

     Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his
     feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...
     And Atley is there ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

                    MEMPHIS
          My version of "take this job and shove
          it..."

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Are you crazy? You throw down with The
          Carpenter? You got a grudge against
          your life?

     But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE
     SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and
     Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious
     Calitri ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
          Now you done it. And with you
          gone - who'll save Kip the next
          time ... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          This is all about there not being
          a next time, Atley --

     And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger
     and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the
     unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the
     dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

     THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops
     Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the
     coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and
     Butz are there -

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Hello, boys -- !

                    DIGGER
          Hey! What happened? Did they make it

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          They did not. A tragedy.

                    DIGGER
          Mr. C. around?

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          He's napping. He said to take it away...

     Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the
     van...

                    DIGGER
          That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.

                    MEMPHIS
          Absolutely.

     And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

                    MEMPHIS
          Point-five ...

     And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Get outta here, Memphis --

     And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

                    MEMPHIS
          Thank you...

     Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley
     watches him go ...

                    ATLEY JACKSON
          Hoo-boy.

     EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

     Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's
     "Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's
     ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on
     the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

                    MEMPHIS
          What are you doing here?

                    KIP
          I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
          Knew there was no way he was gonna
          accept her ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Where'd you find this one?

                    KIP
          Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors",
          Memphis. Cos you never know when
          you're gonna need one --

                    MEMPHIS
          You boost her -- ?

                    KIP
          Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

                    MEMPHIS
          Move over ...

     Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

     EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

     Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

                    MEMPHIS
          You okay -- ?

                    KIP
          I dunno ... I keep thinking about
          him.

     Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED
     with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers
     ... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough
     is enough ... He pulls over ...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          What are you doing? You can outrun
          him...

                    MEMPHIS
          It's over. The dumb shit is over ...

     The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,
     of course, Detective Castlebeck.

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I know you.

                    MEMPHIS
          You know my back.

     Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          It's finished, Randall. Get out of
          the car... You, too, kid...

     Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

                    RADIO (O.S.)
          We have suspect vehicle matching description
          at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:
          the suspect vehicle has just been
          apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,
          190 Street and Campanza ...

     Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

                    KIP
          I reported it ...

     Memphis is impressed...

                    MEMPHIS
          Not bad

     ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          Dispatch, what's the license on
          the suspect vehicle... ?

                    RADIO (O.S.)
          License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat:
          California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.

     And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity
     plate that says - MY 67 ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          10-4.

     And he goes back over to Memphis ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
          Looks like we live to fight another
          round. You're free to go ...

     Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)
          Your brother's a clever man and a
          talented thief, Kipling. But as role
          models go, you should observe the man,
          not the thief ...

                    KIP
          Yes, sir ...

     Castlebeck sighs...

                    MEMPHIS
          Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a
          beautiful day, the birds are singing,
          and there's a container ship on
          Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...

     Castlebeck nods ...

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I want you gone, Randall. Settle your
          affairs. Make it right with those you
          love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I
          want you out of here. Out of here for
          good this time ...

                    MEMPHIS
          Consider me gone, Detective --

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          I'll catch you later, Randall --

                    MEMPHIS
          Double-meaning intended --

                    DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
          You betcha --

     And Memphis races off ...

     EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

     Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
     and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
     up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
     that cash...

                    MEMPHIS
          Split it up. Any word on Donny?

                    OTTO
          He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

                    MEMPHIS
          What happened to Sway?

                    OTTO
          She left...

     He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

                    MIRROR MAN
          Poor Toby, man...

     A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

                    THE SPHINX 
          If his premature demise has, in some way,
          enlightened the rest of you as to the
          grim finish below the glossy veneer of
          criminal life, and inspired you to change
          your ways, then his death carries with it
          an inherent nobility. And a supreme
          glory. We should all be so fortunate.
          You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

     They all stare at him, stunned...

                    FREB
          You spoke

     The Sphinx shrugs...

                    TUMBLER
          Say something else, man

     But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
     ... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
     from the briefcase... To Kip:

                    MEMPHIS
          You remember where you got this
          Eleanor -- ?

                    KIP
          Sure, man --

                    MEMPHIS
          She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
          Give 'em sixty ...

     And he hands Kip the cash ...

                    KIP
          You want me to buy her?

                    MEMPHIS
          Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
          I've never actually paid for a car. I want
          to see what it feels like

     Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

                    OTTO
          Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
          now...

                    MEMPHIS
          I'll see you soon --

                    KIP
          Where you off to -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Thought I'd go for a ride -

     He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

                    KIP
          Hey, Memphis -- ?

     Memphis turns back...

                    KIP (cont'd)
          I'll see you, right?

     Memphis nods ...

                    MEMPHIS
          You'll see me ...

     And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

     INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

     Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
     ... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
     brings her to her feet ...

                    SWAY
          What are you doing... ?

                    MEMPHIS
          Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

     And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
     her cheek...

                    SWAY
          I can't. I got a back load of repairs
          and one of the mechanics called in
          sick and I haven't slept and--
               (stops short; sees the new Eleanor
               outside)
          Where to -- ?

                    MEMPHIS
          I dunno. I know a place.

     She looks at him... Long and hard...

                    SWAY
          This time it's for real?

                    MEMPHIS
          Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

     EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

     And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
     in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
     neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

     EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

     As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
     those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
     GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

     Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
     one cold...

     EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

     A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
     except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
     the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

     As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
     muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
     stare at the casket, spooked.

                    BUTZ
          Do you believe this?

                    DIGGER
          What should we do?

                    BUTZ
          We gotta do what we gotta do --

                    DIGGER
          Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
          can't he finish the freakin' job?

                    BUTZ
          Forget about it. Occupational hazard,
          Digger. C'mon...

     And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
     CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

     And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
     thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
     covered in dirt. Gone.

     And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
     about you/I just can't live without you/I really want
     you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

     EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

     Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
     ... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
     driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

                    MEMPHIS
          What -- ?

                    SWAY
          Nothing. Just that if I was less
          secure, I might think you were more
          into Eleanor than you are me...

                    MEMPHIS
          She does have one thing you don't.

                    SWAY
          What's that?

                    MEMPHIS
          Bench seats.

     And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
     close... He throws his arm around her ...

     And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
     swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
     SING ON... And we hear:

                    MEMPHIS (O.S.)
          You like bingo -- ?

     And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
     ... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
     pattern that is the American road.

     THE END
