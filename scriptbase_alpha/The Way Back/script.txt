          1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1

          A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly
          floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath.
          Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern
          India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and
          beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall
          clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing
          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives
          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we
          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and
          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of
          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny
          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald
          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing
          lights. The camera slows, and hovers.

          2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2

          Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed
          wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight.
          Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber
          buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and
          all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided
           barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. 

           SUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'.

          3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3

           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 
          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
          territories, still ear something of their national 
          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
          has put them here.
          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
          by their tattoos.

          These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular
          criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters
          of the block.
          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
          BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
          criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
          cards.
          [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED,

          EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH].

                         BOHDAN

                         (IN RUSSIAN)
          What've you got?
          VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines
          it briefly.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          Think I want your stinking lice
          farm?

                         VALKA
          Polish tailor.
          He shows the label.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          See? From Krakov. Good as new.
          BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
          suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
          his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
          sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
          coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And the sausage.
          BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I
          swear. I hope you die with an axe
          in your skull, and your balls
          ripped out.
          The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no
          reaction.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          OK. For the bread.

                         (CNNTTNTTFD )

                         3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3
          BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid 
          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. 
          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.

                         BOHDAN
          For the bread.

                         VALKA 
          For the bread, and the sausage, 
          bastard! 
          BOHDAN enjoying himself. 

                         BOHDAN 
          Throw in that crappy shirt you're 
          wearing and I might be tempted. 
          Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
          he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
          Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
          across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
          VALKA loses.
           VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his 
           bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then 
          offers to BOHDAN. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D)
           I don't play for regulation issue
           crap.
          VALKA lights a cigarette. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D) 
           All done, Valka? 
           VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil 
          of cool. 

                          VALKA 
           I go on credit. 

                          BOHDAN 
           'Credit'? 

                         (CONTINUED)

          VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by
          a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          You're already in debt.
          VALKA's anxious eyes. They settle on SMITH by the stove.
          He speaks in carefully articulated English.

                         VALKA
          Come here.
          SMITH returns the stare, then slowly approaches.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Take off your coat.
          A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's
          something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable.
          The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding
          VALKA's stare.

          [THE DIALOGUE RETURNS TO RUSSIAN.]

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Worth shit!
          He looks at SMITH's companion.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You.
          ANDREI goes pale, removes his coat to reveal a decent-
          looking patterned wool sweater. He offers the coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Let's have the sweater.

                         ANDREI
          Take the coat.

                         VALKA
          I want the sweater.
          ANDREI doesn't move.

           VALKA (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          Your babushka make it for you?
          Come on, hand it over.

                          
          ANDREI is visibly shaking.

                         (CONTTNTTFD )

                         ANDREI
          You have no authority, here.
          VALKA gets up, moves slowly to ANDREI, a smile on his
          lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his
          trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something,
          and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and
          stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and
          leans to one side.

                         BOHDAN
          Was that really necessary?
          In the dim light ANDREI's face is grey as he sags to the
          floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor
          do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the
          knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI
          steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man,
          handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN
          examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his
          hands.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          OK. For the sausage.
          The game resumes.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          4 EXT. GRAVEYARD, FOREST NEAR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 4

          Freshly dug graves. Close on one of these, stones piled
          in a mound over the grave. Hands into frame moving aside
          the stones. Wider to see two PRISONERS, breath steaming
          from their mouths, as they work quickly and quietly to
          uncover the grave. The older of the two is KHABAROV,
          late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive
          looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of
          light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette.

                         KHABAROV
          Here he is.
          He reaches out to touch a human toe poking out of the
          rocks.
          As they work -
          Close on the face of ANDREI, as they continue to uncover
          his body.

          He's not frozen yet, that's lucky.
          The remaining stones are removed to find the corpse
          dressed in nothing but underwear.

                         LAZAR
          Damn! Picked clean! Bloody
          thieves.

                         KHABAROV
          Keep your voice down, be grateful
          there's anything left.
          They reach into the grave to retrieve the underwear.

           LAZAR's hands in water, some kind of tin sink, water
           running red as the underwear is rinsed clean of blood.

          5 EXT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105 - DAWN 5

           A Soviet guard beats a hammer against a hanging length of
          iron.

          6 INT. BARRACK BUILDING - SAME TIME - DAWN 6

          Close on the barrack stove, the underwear drying,
          KHABAROV's hands into the frame.
          As the prisoners rise, follow a hand to hand exchange of
          the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
          having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
          Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
          half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
          two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the
          men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one
          piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in
          the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache
          of hoarded food and other items.

          The saved morsel he places on his tongue, and closes his
          eyes. He doesn't chew, just lets it dissolve like the
          Eucharist. Then it's gone in a slow swallow and he opens
          his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
          hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at
          his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's
          a crumb there. Into frame, the tip of his tongue as it
          slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread.

          7 EXT. LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - DAWN 7

          The camp seen in a distant view - surrounded by double
          wire, a collection of weathered timber buildings with
          watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the
          perimeter. In the distance, dense forest.
          Entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march
          toward the camp. Following behind is a lorry, carrying
          six guards, supplies for their recent journey, and a camp
          stove.

          8 EXT. CAMP GATES - DAWN 8

          As they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch
          stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in
          Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND

          HEROISM'.
          The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a
          look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. 
          ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast,
          marching toward them on their way to work. They have
          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns
          pass each other the contrast between the half-starved,
          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of
          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we
          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse
          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,
          and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As
          they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both
          Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian
          with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a
          blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another
          Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group.

          9 EXT. 'THE ZONE', CAMP 105 - DAY 9

          The newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various
          buildings - an area known as the 'ZONE'.

                         9 CONTINUED: 9
          The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of
          cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing
          old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones.
          The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into
          slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the
          Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks
          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new
          camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and
          the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently
          issues an order dismissing him.
          The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of
          documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received
          them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys
          the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with
          a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features.
          He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand.

                         COMMANDANT
          Enemies of the People! Look about
          you...and understand... it is not
          our guns, or our dogs, or our
          wire, that forms your prison.
          Siberia is your prison. All four

          Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house,
          heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of
          others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash-
          house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort
          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.
          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on
          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-
          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a
          section of the old wall falls to the ground.

          14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14

          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the
          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful
          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of
          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no
          bowl, so he uses his hat.
          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.
          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners
          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a
          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.

          SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on
          hearing English spoken.
          As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men
          scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into
          the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd
          scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime,
          then lick them clean.

          SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a
          hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips
          it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of
          the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage-
          eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him,
          placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches
          as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats
          it, his every move watched by the starving man at his
          feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man
          who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each
          other.

          JANUSZ surprised by the American accented English.

                         (IN ENGLISH)
          He's an old man.

                         SMITH
          I'm an old man. But I'll be alive
          in the morning. He won't.
          He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          'Kindness'. That can kill you
          here. You'll learn that.
          He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and
          chewing slowly, turns and walks away.

          The men sitting or lying on their bunks, a little
          conversation here and there but most have withdrawn into
          themselves, just glad to have survived another day.

          In bone-chilling cold the prisoners form up in their
          brigades as a guard begins counting them. JANUSZ looks
          toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men
          who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the
          ground - among them the 'garbage-eater' from the night
           before. JANUSZ glances over toward SMITH who stares

          saws drifting from the forest floor.
          JANUSZ and his friends - VOSS, TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN -
          work at trimming felled trees of branches, and then
          sawing them into lengths.
          SMITH and his gang work nearby. He watches JANUSZ
          peeling strips of bark from a pine-tree and stuffing them
          in his pocket.
          KHABAROV, too, works here with a third gang, cutting and

           On the valley floor, below towering cliffs, some 150 men
          haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance
          across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks.
          A fire blazes in a 44 gallon drum set up in an open-sided
          wooden shelter. Here BOHDAN and his criminal associates
          supervise the work. VALKA has fallen on a slippery slope
          within the Urka hierarchy following his losses and
          growing debt.

          JANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay
          by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move
          away, staring into the black hole leading into the
          mountain. Eerie sounds drift up from deep below. A look
          of utter dread on his face.

          The prisoners work hard to fill their quotas - VOSS
          swings his axe like a demon, but even with his
          contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the
          mark showing at the top of the storage bay.
          BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working
          gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's
          group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV
          leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ.

          No-one could meet that quota even 
          if they were fed and rested. 
          KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at 
          a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes
          buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears
          away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut
          timber.

          the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the
          fresh cut logs.

          They just make it, but BOHDAN notices the end of an old
          grey log poking out from the center of the stack. He
          stops his measuring of their quota. A tense moment, then
          he nods and leaves. KHABAROV crosses from his gang to
          join them.

                         JANUSZ
          He knows.
          KHABAROV shrugs.

                         KHABAROV
          He knows, but he doesn't care, as
          long as his arse is protected.
          This is 'Tufta'. Bull-shit.
          JANUSZ nods his thanks.

          The long march back to camp. JANUSZ peers left and right
          toward the beckoning forest. Beside him ZORAN senses his
          friend might just take off then and there. He places a
          restraining hand on his arm, as a guard's voice drifts
          through the still air:

                         23
          VOSS and KAZIK are by the stove unwinding their long foot-
          cloths that most wear in place of socks. KAZIK hangs the
          damp cloths on the stove to dry and sets out to examine
          his toes, which are in poor shape, suffering the early
          stages of frostbite. TOMASZ sits nearby sketching the
          scene on a sheet of birch-bark, using a piece of 
          charcoal. 
          WIDER to see VALKA, looking on in admiration. TOMASZ is
          uneasy despite the implied compliment. VALKA hands him a
          sheet of paper, and the stub of a pencil.

          24 A BUNK NEAR THE STOVE - SAME TIME 24
          BOHDAN lies on his bunk, surrounded by several of his
          tattooed henchmen listening to a story. The storyteller,
          looking rather uncomfortable, is ZORAN. His Russian is
          good but for a moment his memory fails him as he
          desperately tries to recall the next beat in the story.

                         BOHDAN
          Keep going and you'll get some
          bread - so how does this 'Long
          John Silver' find the treasure?

                         YURI
          I knew a type like that. Remember
          Igor? He had one leg.

          Shut up.
          (Then to ZORAN)
          Go on.
          The story resumes, ZORAN giving it all he's got, when
          VALKA appears a sketch in his hand. He passes it to
          BOHDAN. CLOSE on the sketch - a lusty naked woman.
          VALKA makes a gesture implying masturbation. BOHDAN
          examines the drawing before licking the back of it,
          lifting his shirt, sticking it to his chest, then
          lowering his shirt again. He waves VALKA away.

          25 JANUSZ'S BUNK - SAME TIME 25
          CLOSE on a shirt.
          The shirt lies on JANUSZ's bunk and it's moving. A tiny
          subtle movement, but just perceptible, the movement
          caused by hundreds of lice.

          WIDER,
          to see this is JANUSZ's view, KHABAROV there too,
          watching over his shoulder.

          For the lice I have an old folk
          remedy.

          He picks up the shirt and walks toward the door of the
          barrack, indicating JANUSZ should follow. As he passes
          his bunk he scoops up his own shirt.

          26 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - NIGHT 26

          KHABAROV leads him toward the wire. From somewhere deep
          in the bowels of the earth, a low sinister rumbling, the
          very ground itself shaking momentarily. JANUSZ stops,
          while KHABAROV keeps walking.

                         KHABAROV
          The mines. They blast at night.
          He pauses to let JANUSZ catch up, then looking furtively
          about him, he crouches by a drift of snow.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          Shirt.
          JANUSZ hands him his shirt. He scrapes a hole in the
          snow, buries the shirt, leaving only the tip showing. He
          does the same with his own shirt.

                         JANUSZ
          We're going to leave them here
          overnight? Why?

                         KHABAROV
          You'll see.
          JANUSZ stares up at the wire, then to a distant
          watchtower, its searchlight briefly illuminating him.
          KHABAROV follows his eye-line.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)

          associate, overseer of
          construction.
          He nods toward an area where stockade wall is being
          replaced with double wire.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          Few ever escape the camps. I've
          waited for someone like you,
          someone with the strength and will
          to see it through.

          They marched as due North from the

          have no idea where we are.
          KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out
          a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and
          indicates the location of the camp.

                         KHABAROV
          We believe about 500 kilometers
          north of Lake Baikal.

                         JANUSZ
          We could follow the edge of the
          Lake, it runs due South.

          Why wait?

                         KHABAROV
          It's 1000 kilometers to the
          border, maybe more. We need
          careful planning, stock-pile food.
          I've already begun - trading,
          dealing. You could do the same.
          In the Autumn the weather is

          snows to cover our tracks.

          At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the
          bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The
          corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial.
          JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's
          passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of
          desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be
          excused another day of the killing work, the majority
          turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The
          days' bread ration is being weighed and issued. If not
          exactly 500 grams a little is added or subtracted, the
          cook keeping trimmed slices, placing them in a tin.

          Having been counted once, inside the camp, the brigade of
          prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed
          guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD
          NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than
          usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high
          wind blowing. Khabarov stands with JANUSZ.

          The freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving
          sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a
          halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the
          guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'?
          The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse,
          their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them.

           Could go badly for you.
          The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to
          stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The
          GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other
          guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on
          the freezing ground. All but SMITH.

          The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and
          that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward
          the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol.
          On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the
          unfolding drama.
          GUARD NO. 1 shouts for SMITH to return, others raise
          their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is
          conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to
          lower their weapons.

          Let the prisoners take shelter in
          the trees! Shoot anyone who makes

          courage.

          The men work frantically collecting fallen timber. SMITH
          watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his
          shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising
          the building of their shelter. Most of the other
          prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of
          sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building
          something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as
          he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a
          team under his direction.

           to their improvised shelter. As SMITH sits, ZORAN offers
           his hand.

                          ZORAN
          You are brave man - Dragan Zoran,
          Yugoslav this is Janusz
          Wieszczek the youngster is
          Kazik, both Polish.
          (They nod to SMITH)

                         VOSS
          Andrejs Voss, Latvian.

                         ZORAN
          (It's a League of Nations.)
          English our common language!
          SMITH nods.

                         JANUSZ
          And you're ?

                          SMITH
          Smith.

                         JANUSZ
          Your first name?

                         SMITH
          Mister.

                         JANUSZ
          Mister Smith?

                         SMITH
          That's right.
          As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into
          his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He
          hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews
          on the bark. The others follow his example.
          Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He
          takes note of the group as future troublemakers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            25.

          AD30 INT. BARRACKS - DAWN AD30 

           The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day, 
           when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1 
           enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and 
           his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH - 

           GUARD NO. 1 

                          (IN RUSSIAN) 
           You don't like being out in the 
           cold, do you Cowboy? 
           And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ. 

                          SMITH 
           Might as well have shot us 
           yesterday. 
           JANUSZ and the others look at him. 

                          SMITH (CONT'D) 
           We're for the mine. 

          30 INT. MINE - DAY 30

          A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
          frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
          working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
          sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
          deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
          sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
          most time in this frozen hell.
          The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
          shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
          to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
          into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
          the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
          cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
          was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
          fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
          Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.

          31 INT. DEEPER IN THE MINE - DAY 31

          KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden
          with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars
          attached to the cart by leather harnesses.

                         31 CONTINUED: 31
          THE PROF's wasted frame and sallow complexion are in
          contrast to his lively intelligent eyes. He says
          something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He
          doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then
          English.

                         KAZIK
          English, yes.
          They share a smile.

                         PROF
          I was only saying, these collars -
          the same used by ancient Egyptian
          people.

                         KAZIK
          Yes, but on their horses probably.

                         PROF
          No. Same. On people.

                         KAZIK
          How do you know that?

                         PROF
          I was professor of Egyptology.
          Leningrad University.
          KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting
          even more effort into dragging the load.

          32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32

          A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
          pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
          easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
          'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
          stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
          pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
          warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
          the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
          hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
          SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
          here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
          see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
          mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
          against the light. He watches a moment, something not
          right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
          after him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          33 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 33

          JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls
          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
          ground.

          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY 
           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
          wall.

          34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34

          CLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him,
          grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an
          adjoining tunnel.

                         SMITH
          Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

                         JANUSZ
          Got to get out!
          SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
          with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
          effect.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          It can be done.

                         SMITH
          What can be done? 

                         JANUSZ
          He knows a way through the wire.
          SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-
          Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.

                         (A WHISPER)
          He has a plan.

                         SMITH
          Who?

                         JANUSZ
          His name is Khabarov.
          Now SMITH understands.

                         SMITH
          The actor.

                         JANUSZ
          You know him?

                         SMITH
          He has no intention of escaping.

                         JANUSZ
          What?

                         SMITH
          He's aliar. Been here foryears
          -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen
          Ifirstcame here. He justlikes
          totalkabout escape. I'veknown
          others like him.

                         JANUSZ
          Why should I believe you?

                         SMITH
          (shakes his head)
          Nothing is for nothing in the
          camps. From you he gets your
          energy, your spirit. You feed his
          'dream' of escape. You help keep
          him alive. He's no more than a
          leech.

                         JANUSZ
          You're a cold bastard, Mister.

                         SMITH

                         (SHRUGS)
          I'm still alive, that's all I
          know. But I won't be in six
          months. And neither will you.
          Not in the mines. So, if you're
          serious about making a run for it -
          I'm in.

          I thought you were a loner?

                         SMITH
          Can't be done alone. Besides you
          have a weakness that could be
          useful to me.

                         JANUSZ
          And what's that?

                         SMITH
          Compassion. If anything happens
          to me, I'm counting on you
          carrying me.
          JANUSZ knows he's not joking.

          35 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, SAME TIME - NIGHT 35

           It is snowing heavily, and after swallowing their soup, 
           JANUSZ and his friends walk back to the barracks. KAZIK 
           stumbles, and is helped to his feet by VOSS. He limps on 
           to the barrack a hand resting for support on VOSS' 
           shoulder. JANUSZ is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he 
           door, turns, and looks back. After a moment staring at 
           the ground he hurries inside. 

          36 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 36

          JANUSZ has a puzzled KHABAROV by the arm, guiding him
          back to the door.

          37 EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 37

          He points to the ground - CLOSE on footprints as they
          rapidly disappear under the heavy snowfall.

                         JANUSZ
          Tonight.
          KHABAROV looks from the footprints to JANUSZ, a horrified
          look on his face.

                         KHABAROV
          It's a passing storm!

                         JANUSZ
          It'll do, it'll cover our tracks.

          detailed plans, maps

                         JANUSZ

                         (OVERLAP)
          The timing will never be perfect, 
          they won't expect it now!

                         KHABAROV
          But the distances! And food!
          What about food?

                         JANUSZ
          We've been trading, the American
          is with us. He has food, you have
          food.

                         KHABAROV
          How long will that last?

                         JANUSZ
          I've spent half my life in the
          woods and mountains. We'll live
          off the land.

                         KHABAROV
          It can't be done!
          JANUSZ shocked at the change in his friends' demeanor,
          the appalling realization that SMITH was right about him.
          He seizes his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          How do we get through the wire?

                         KHABAROV
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                         JANUSZ
          Your friend, Lazar, he knows
          doesn't he?
          A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind
          JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching
          them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks.
          JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.

          A38 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A38

           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other 
           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and 
           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries 
           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in 
           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK 
           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is 
          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
          whispers to him.

                         VOSS
          You can't see, can you?
          A look of panic crosses the boy's face.

                         KAZIK

                         (WHISPERS)
          Don't leave me behind!
          VOSS conflicted.

                         KAZIK (CONT'D)
          Promise me, Andrejs! I could keep
          a hand on your shoulder by night,
          and in the day I can see just
          fine. I won't hold you up.
          Please don't tell them. I'll die
          here.
          JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on
          LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.
          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the
          deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging
          the barracks into darkness.

          AB38 EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT AB38

          Several shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the
          buildings.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            32.

          38 INT. BARRACKS - LATER THAT NIGHT 38

          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
          about near him, a look of terror on his face.

          LATER,
          JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A
          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.

                         VALKA
          There are no secrets here.

                         JANUSZ
          What do you want?

                         VALKA
          The game goes against me. Small
          debt - lose fingers. Big debt, 
          they take head. Me, big debt.
          But one thing I never gamble is my
          Wolf.
          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In forest you need knife to 
          survive. Without? A miracle.
          He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You need a knife, and I need
          miracle to get me out of here.
          With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers
          and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?

          39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39

          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward
          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight
          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.
          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and
          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs
          into the gap, then following them toward the distant
          forest.

          40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40

          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and
          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,
          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with
          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,
          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his
          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.
          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the 
          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before 
          plunging on Southward. 

                         41 FURTHER ALONG 41 
          They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their
          breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow 
          no rest and moves off without a backward glance. 

                         42 FURTHER STILL 42
           JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his 
           hands on his knees, gulping for air. The others stop
           too, VALKA dropping to his knees. JANUSZ runs back to 
           VALKA, drags him to his feet. 

                          JANUSZ
           Get up. Or we die right now. You
           know how fast dogs travel. 
           He turns to the others. 

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D) 
           Run, damn you! Run! 
           He moves to SMITH.

          SMITH waves him away, gets up and continues.

          43 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY 43

          A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The
          snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep
          depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no
          further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight
          is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS.
          In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They
          look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the
          sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen
          timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle
          in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to
          VALKA, whispers.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his
          short life.

                         VALKA
          What?

                         JANUSZ
          Your knife.
          With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his
          knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ.
          While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims
          fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to
          make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They
          go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their
          digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a
          meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to
          cover their hide.

          It's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit
          shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle, ears straining,
          sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still.
          A tense moment, and then they are passing, the voices
          fading into silence.

          47 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, SIBERIA - NIGHT 47

          The strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and
          as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the
          snow from throat and lungs. VALKA, his arm wrapped
          defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his
          knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK
          hangs onto the back of VOSS' coat, VOSS at times
          literally dragging him along.

          from the tree, cuts two triangular holes some centimeters
          apart, then rams the base of the bark piece into VALKA'S
          collar. It's a crude mask.

          49 EXT. THE PROCESSION, FOREST - NIGHT 49

          The group, all now wearing the improvised snow-masks,
          push forward against the wind, looking like a tribe from
          some distant age dressed in ceremonial masks.

          JANUSZ in the lead, some fifty paces ahead, but he's
          stopped, thigh-deep in the snow, as still as a statue.
          The others catch up, puzzled. SMITH calls to him, lifts
          his mask. He's asleep. SMITH shakes him back to
          consciousness, all the while the storm continues at full
          force.

                         SMITH
          We've got to make fire!

                         JANUSZ
          No! You saw how close they were!
          KAZIK sinks to the snow, then ZORAN.

                         SMITH
          We die either way, might as well
          die warm.

          A51 EXT. FOREST, LATER - NIGHT A51

          A hole scraped out of the snow and a wind-break of fallen
          timber, is all they can manage in their exhausted state.
          Down in the hole JANUSZ is striking a spark from a flint.
          Some are fading fast, KAZIK keeps falling asleep, to be
          shaken awake by TOMASZ. MR. SMITH is splitting wood into 
          ever finer shavings, ready to feed a nascent fire. Still
          the damp kindling will not catch.
          They draw closer together for warmth, draping their arms
          over each other's shoulders. ZORAN's head drops to his 
          chest. TOMASZ shakes him.

          The other look to ZORAN, and fighting the desire to
          sleep, he begins. VALKA loves a good story, and despite
          their desperate situation he listens with the attention
          and concentration of a small child.

                         ZORAN
          Once upon a time, in the days of
          wooden ships, there was a great
          storm in far away seas. A
          merchant ship hurried toward big
          rocks, lightening in the sky, the
          waves as high as house-tops.
          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship
          smashed onto the rocks, the
          sailors cried in fear, called out
          to God, but they all drowned. All
          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He
          woke to find himself all alone on
          a desert island. For many years
          he lived without any human
          companions, until one day he saw
          something shocking! What was it?
          A human footprint. He was no
          longer alone. But was the
          stranger friend or foe? Another
          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a
          cannibal?
          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the 
          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR. SMITH 
          feeds in small shavings. The group watch with the awe 
          and wonder usually reserved for child-birth. Then
          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,
          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and
          spreads.

          AB51 EXT. FOREST, CAMPFIRE - DAWN AB51

          A comfortable blaze, the group, minus JANUSZ, sleep or
          drowse in the life-giving warmth, when a pile of snow
          lands on the fire. The others react. It's JANUSZ. He
          heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out.
          By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost
          out of sight and they hurry to catch up, fearful of being
          left behind.

          limbs. VALKA looks up to find SMITH staring at him.

                         VALKA
          You stare at me like the snake at
          the rabbit or is it the other
          way 'round?
          VALKA turns to the others with a silver-toothed smile,

          a thumping sound outside. The group go very still. A
          second thump, overhead this time. VALKA draws his knife.
          A trickle of snow falls through the vent in the roof.

          Alright, let's see what you've
          got.
          No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
          emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
          bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
          swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
          of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
          small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
          KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
          grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
          are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of
          barbed-wire, etc. SMITH picks up the barbed wire,
          examines it.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)

          VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something
          familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar.

          Yes...and...
          From the sack he produces KHABAROV's hoarded supply of 
          food and other items. Off JANUSZ's reaction -

          worry. I talk to him. Everything

          We share.
          JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances
          at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
          begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
          VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
          eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
          fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
          thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
          daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a
          tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.

          is again studying moss on the side of a tree.

          The group in the shelter of the trees. The sky is
          overcast but at least it's not too cold. Everywhere
          about is deep snow from the recent storm. TOMASZ
          prepares a meal from their dry rations, small portions
          for men who have expended so much energy. KAZIK examines
          his swollen blistered feet. VALKA has his boots off,
          shaking them.

          VALKA (TO KAZIK)
          Clean inside boots, foot-cloths.
          KAZIK copies him.

          God.
          The others are listening, and some do likewise.

          52 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 52

          With lengths of wood as 'ski-poles', the group begin to
          make up lost time. VOSS has lashed his rope-belt to
          KAZIK who walks behind him. SMITH wonders about this,
          but says nothing. They pause at the top of a rise
          amongst the trees, on hearing the sound of dogs howling
          from behind.

           JANUSZ a short distance away. He plants his 'ski-pole' 
           in the snow, marking the tip of its shadow with a pine- 
           cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the 
          second marker - about a foot in length. Then he stands,
          and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine-cone
          and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in
          the snow, he points, calling to them.

                         JANUSZ

           Cheers from the watching group.

           They move off down toward a distant valley, ZORAN the 
           last to leave, doubt on his face as he studies the series 
           of seemingly endless forested hills stretching before 
           them.

          up with his 'Pakhan'.

          62 EXT. LATER, FIRESIDE - DUSK 62

          The fugitives settle for the coming night. As TOMASZ
          unpacks their meagre food supply JANUSZ sketches a map on
          a piece of birch-bark. The other sit exhausted, some
          close to sleep, except SMITH who is working the piece of
          barbed wire from KHABAROV's stash.

          surprised at his cold tone.
          The rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp.
          Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes
          their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on
          KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's
          still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a
          load of wood, turning back into the forest for more.
          Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take
          up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc.
          VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned.

          I make them laugh.

                         TOMASZ
          Not any more.
          ZORAN turns away from him, curling up into a foetal
          position.

           SMITH walking through the vast cave, his attention caught 
           by two massive holes in the roof. He walks on toward 
           their camp outside an opening at the far end. 

          73 EXT. CAVE - DUSK


                          73 
          TOMASZ has water boiling on the fire. He calls to the

                         OTHERS -

                         TOMASZ
          What do you have? Come on, no
          holding back.
          SMITH approaches from the cave, hands over two small
          fish, his day's catch. VOSS steps forward with a dead
          squirrel. VALKA has nothing. TOMASZ reaches for their
          cooking pot cooling by the fire. He passes a cup to

          JANUSZ.

                         TOMASZ (CONT'D)
          Pine-needle tea.

          JANUSZ sips, reacts to the bitterness of the brew,then
          passes it on. 

          74 EXT./INT. CAVE - NIGHT 74

          Sleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns,
          muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who
          sits close beside him. A whispered conversation -

                         VALKA
          Who will be first?
          JANUSZ looks at him.

                         JANUSZ
          You mean the first to die?
          VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ.

                         VALKA
          I think that sucker, the artist.
          But better if it was him.
          He nods toward ZORAN.

                         JANUSZ
          It might be you.
          VALKA shrugs.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Why 'better' if it's Zoran?
          VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms.

                         VALKA
          More soft. More tender.
          JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Mister only gets little fish now. 
          We must have meat, or we die. 
          You're the Pakhan, you've thought
          of it. We all have. That's why
          you brought extra people isn't it?
          For food? An old Urka escape
          trick. I swear to God you were an
          Urka in another life.

                         JANUSZ
          We'll get food when we get to Lake
          Baikal, plenty of fish there.

          You said we should have seen Lake
          a week ago. We're lost, Pakhan.
          JANUSZ stares into the fire as VALKA lays down to sleep.

          A75 LATER, NIGHT

                         A75
          It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the
          entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders,
          looking out into the still night. Behind him a low
          growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns,
          a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a
          dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates
          through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes
          JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes
          VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they
          walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the
          sound, VALKA drawing his knife.

          75 INT. CAVE - NIGHT


                          75 
          The dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at
          a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and
          face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling.
          On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run
          back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH,
          TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all
          the barking and shouting.
          VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of
          raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group,
          down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill,
          only JANUSZ stands back, watching them.

                         76

          EXT./INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING 76

          Some sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and
          listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's
          point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his
          pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          I'll be back in a week - if I find
          the lake. If not, you're on your
          own.

                         VALKA
          I come too.

                         JANUSZ
          (shakes his head)
          I'll travel faster alone. Mr.
          Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm
          gone.
          JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to
          SMITH, he moves off.

          77 EXT. SOME DISTANCE FROM CAMP - DAWN 77

          Now out of earshot, JANUSZ turns to SMITH. SMITH knows
          what it's about.

                         SMITH
          I know. Valka.

                         JANUSZ
          Don't let him out of your sight.

                         SMITH
          Good luck.
          As JANUSZ heads off into the forest.

          78 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY, SIBERIA - DAY 78

          A magnificent vista - a broad plain sweeping toward a
          distant line of hills. It's a beautiful clear day and
          the lone figure of JANUSZ, dwarfed by the landscape,
          walks steadily Southward.

          79 EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DUSK 79 

          Sheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill, he
          takes pine-cones from his pocket, breaks them open and
          eats the seeds. Then he's up and off again, leaning
          heavily on his staff.

          80 EXT. A BARREN PLAIN - DAY 80

          The weather changes from a clear Spring morning to cold
          and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant
          slopes. JANUSZ bends into the wind, his pace slowing.
          He stumbles, sinks to the ground, fighting the desire to
          let go, to give himself to sleep, and the swift death
          that will surely follow. His eyes begin to close. Then
          he sees it. Just ahead of him. The gate. The gate from
          his vision in the mine. He struggles to his feet,
          staggers on -

                         80 CONTINUED: 80
          JANUSZ'S VISION: A repeat of his earlier hallucination -
          the click of the gate latch, the flagstones at his feet
          as he moves down the path. (All the while the
          accompanying sound is of JANUSZ's laboured breathing in
          the present 'reality'). He's at the front door, camera
          pans to the loose brick in the wall beside the door.

          81 EXT. CAMPSITE, FOREST - DUSK 81

          JANUSZ staggers back into camp, half dead and shivering
          with cold. VALKA is quickly beside him with SMITH and

          VOSS.

                         JANUSZ
          Three days from here. South by
          West.
          He collapses. VOSS shouts for the fire to be built up,
          hot water to be boiled. He feels his pulse, checks his
          eyes.

                         VOSS
          Stones! Gather stones! Heat them
          in the fire!

          82 EXT. CAMPSITE, STILL LATER - NIGHT 82

          Throughout the night they take turns replacing the hot
          stones surrounding his body and massaging his feet and
          hands. On one such occasion SMITH finds himself at
          JANUSZ's side. JANUSZ opens his eyes.

                         SMITH
          What's the 'brick'?

                         JANUSZ
          What did I say?

                         SMITH
          Something about a loose brick.
          JANUSZ nods, offers no explanation.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You know if you don't pull through
          soon we'll have to leave you.

                         JANUSZ
          I expect nothing less.

          So you better get better quick if
          you want to see home again.

                         JANUSZ
          We could've used you in the Polish
          army. Fired you out of a cannon.
          He closes his eyes, lapses back into a deep sleep.

          It's a beautiful evening as the file of travellers climb
          toward the crest of the hill.

          85 EXT. MOUNTAIN, SIBERIA - DUSK 85 

           From the crest, a panorama of Lake Baikal - a massive 
           body of water stretching to the horizon. 
           The fugitives rest, and consider the next stage of their

          shoulder.

          SMITH signals JANUSZ to stop, while holding a finger to
          his lips for silence. JANUSZ joins him, followed by the
          others.

                         SMITH
          We're being followed.

                         JANUSZ
          Followed? Where?

                         SMITH
          Fifty yards back. A man on his
          own. May have seen us - crossed
          into the trees beside the track.
          A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws
          his knife.

                         VOSS
          No killing.

                         VALKA

                         (TO VOSS)
          No? I think you've killed before.
          You say too many prayers for an
          innocent man.
          VOSS looks uneasy.

                         SMITH
          He gives us away, the soldiers
          will be on us in no time.

                         JANUSZ
          Valka, go back on the other side
          of the track, then come up behind,
          in case he makes a run for it.
          VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of
          the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the
          trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen
          timber as weapons.
          JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces
          ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ
          stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where
          they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman.
          There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a
          scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut
          hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She
          looks frightened and desperate.

          From her waif like appearance, it's hard to tell her age
          - an old thirteen or a young sixteen?
          The men discreetly drop their irovised weapons. She
          looks ready to make a run for it on seeing VALKA with his
          drawn knife. JANUSZ gestures for the others to fall
          back, as he cautiously approaches, uttering reassuring
          words.

          The others sit smoking by the pathway, watching as JANUSZ
          crosses back from the GIRL to join them.
          He says something to TOMASZ in Polish. A rapid exchange
          between them.

                         SMITH
          What? What is it?

                         JANUSZ
          She's Polish. Been following us
          for several days.

                         VALKA
          What does she want?

                         JANUSZ
          Food? Protection? She's been too
          afraid to approach us until she
          was sure we weren't Russians.

          street gypsies, there are
          thousands like that, less use than
          a dog!
          JANUSZ looks back to the GIRL who watches them from the
          clearing.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Pakhan. Don't do this.

                         JANUSZ
          She's starving.

          Zoran?

                         ZORAN
          Maybe it's kinder to leave her.

                         VOSS
          She's been sent to us. We can't
          leave her.

                         SMITH
          We have no choice.
          JANUSZ knows this is true.

          90 EXT.THE CLEARING, WOODS - DAY 90

           The GIRL watches as JANUSZ approaches. From the way he
           doesn't look at her she knows their answer. JANUSZ
           stands before her a moment. They speak in Polish (sub-
          titled).

                         JANUSZ
          I'm sorry.
          He reaches into his bag, passes her a fish and some nuts
          and berries. It's all she can do to refrain from eating
          it right away.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D) 
          What will you do?

                          

                         THE GIRL
          Go back.
          He guesses at what this might mean.

                         JANUSZ
          If we had enough food
          She stares at him, nods, then walks back toward the path,
          returning in the direction from which she came.

          91 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - DAY 91

          The group walk in silence, the encounter with the girl
          and their subsequent decision weighing heavily on some.
          VOSS keeps looking back over his shoulder.

          92 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 92

          LATER, the group walking out in the open by the lake when
          their attention is caught by the sight of a flock of
          ravens circling and diving on something up ahead - just
          out of sight around a bend in the lake.

          93 EXT. LAKESIDE, MOMENTS LATER - DAY 93

          SMITH is the first to see it - a full grown reindeer
          bogged to the shoulders in the soft mud by the lake's
          edge. As they approach the ravens rise in a great
          flapping of wings. The group circle the wild-eyed beast,
          pathetic in it's attempts to pull itself out of the bog,
          faced now with this new and more deadly threat. VALKA
          draws his knife.

          94 EXT. A COVE, LAKESIDE - DAY 94

          TOMASZ already has a fire going when the rest of the
          party appear dragging the carcass of the reindeer on an
          improvised sled made of driftwood. VOSS watches a moment
          as preparations are made to butcher the animal, then he
          turns and hurries back in the direction from which they
          came. JANUSZ watches him. He knows where he's going.

          95 EXT. LAKESIDE/PATHWAY - DAY 95

          VOSS moving fast beside the lake, then onto the track,
          running now, retracing their steps.

          96 EXT. CAMPSITE, LAKE - DUSK 96

          TOMASZ butchers more meat from the reindeer using VALKA's
          knife, while SMITH sets up a wooden rotisserie on the
          fire assisted by ZORAN. JANUSZ and VALKA are part way
          through skinning the beast when they pause on hearing
          footsteps. Around the point comes VOSS, followed by the
          girl. As they approach, an expectant silence.

                         VOSS
          Her name is, Irena.

          97 EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER - NIGHT 97

          They eat in silence, savoring every mouthful. We hear
          the sounds of eating - bones sucked to the marrow;
          fingers licked; bones crunching.

           IRENA is like a half-starved animal, eating with absorbed
           concentration, the others sneaking looks in her direction
           as they savor the fresh killed meat.

          98 EXT. CAMPSITE, LAKESIDE

          JANUSZ has been on the last watch of the night, and as
          dawn breaks he approaches his sleeping companions. He
          stares down at IRENA, sleeping like a child by the fire.
          Slowly the others stir, all moving slowly and quietly,
          not wanting to disturb her sleep.

          99 EXT. LAKESIDE, CAMPSITE - DAY 99

          ZORAN has set himself up as camp barber - trimming hair
          and shaving heads using the razor-blade inserted in the
          end of a stick, and for shaving cream, a chunk of fat
          from the reindeer. JANUSZ has just been shaved and
          trimmed, the last but for VALKA. While the others wash
          themselves and their clothes, ZORAN calls for VALKA, who
          approaches reluctantly and sits on the rock before the
          barber.

                          

                         VALKA
          Why do we do this?

                         ZORAN
          So we don't look like thieves and
          robbers.
          ZORAN approaches him, blade in hand.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Very still, please.
          He tilts VALKA's neck, seemingly the better to shave him.
          In fact, he enjoys teasing VALKA and his movements are 
          slow and ominous, VALKA clearly nervous.

          one for the smoking of meat.

          construction of a bone frame for a backpack. He later

          frame. Still later he collects nearby vines, rolling

          TOMASZ; In between sketching scenes of his friends at
          work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones,
          and lays out strips of meat given to him by VALKA to dry
          in the sun, part of the jerked meat they will carry as a
          long term food supply.
          VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons
          from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their
          journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or
          to be smoked.

                          
          SMITH; Makes firstly a large bone needle, then later

                          
          makes repairs in his clothes.
          ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his
          suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a
          branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests
          he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting
          the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant
          of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for
          bones or teeth for various uses.
          JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he
          stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts
          a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He
          also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat
          and fat.
          IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she
          seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes
          her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and
          whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she
          reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all
          affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a
          young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the

          SMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite
          collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors
          Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks,
          harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA.
          Then he turns to SMITH.

                         JANUSZ
          She's educated. Speaks good
          English. And French.

          You don't like her, do you?

          others. They agree she comes with
          us.

                         SMITH
          It's decided then?

          You disagree.

                         SMITH
          Apart from food she'll slow us
          down. There's no room for

          Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from
          the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track
          by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to
          her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH
          she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up
          with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to
          charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years.

          103 EXT. RIVER/LAKE - DAY


                         103
          A river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They
          walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow,
          but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with
          JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their
          weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man,
          a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their
          side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim
          for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer
          clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots
          about their necks. IRENA watches.

                         SMITH
          Can you swim?

                         IRENA
          Yes, Mister.

                         SMITH
          You wouldn't lie to me?

                         IRENA
          I'm not lying, Comrade.
          That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy
          by it.

                         SMITH
          And don't call me, 'comrade'.
          With a shout the group plunge into the icy water,
          swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level
          in the other. It's only when they reach the other side
          they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The 
          others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment
          then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.

          They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and
          bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite
          bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times
          it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over
          a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other
          side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on
          her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is
          worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to 
          follow him into the tree-line.

           They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional 
           backward glances to see if the hunter is following. 
           There's no sign of him. 

          106 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 106

           Some time later the group, still a little damp, walk by 
          the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides
          force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at
          mosquitoes as they walk.

                         SMITH
          Janusz tells me your family were
          Kulaks?

                         IRENA
          Yes. Just a cow and some pigs.

                         SMITH
          Were your parents arrested with
          you?

          They're dead.
          She swats at a few mosquitos hovering around her face.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.
          When the Russians came they said
          we were 'kulaks', and exploiting
          the peasants. My parents were
          afraid and hid me in the barn.
          The mosquitos are getting worse and SMITH grabs swatches
          of leaves, passing one to IRENA as they walk on, swinging
          away at the annoying insects.

          sent me to a collective farm.
          They were cruel to me. I ran

                         IRENA
          What?

                         SMITH
          You've never been in the water in
          your life.
          She laughs coquettishly.

                         IRENA
          But I got across, didn't I?

                         SMITH
          And, you said you lived on a farm
          near Warsaw?
          IRENA puzzled.

                         IRENA
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          The Soviets didn't get that far.
          That was German territory.
          She nervously swats the mosquitos.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Your parents weren't murdered were
          they? You made it all up.
          pinched,
          She won't look at him, her face looks thin and
          she seems older.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We've all done terrible things to
          survive. But don't ever lie to me
          again. We've had enough of lies.

                         (CONTINUED)

           She sneaks a glance back over her shoulder at the others,
           then up at SMITH. She nods.

          108 EXT. ROAD, OUTSIDE A SMALL TOWN,LAKE BAIKAL - LATE 108 


                          AFTERNOON 
          A fishing village by the lake. Timber houses straggling
          back up into the surrounding hills. From cover, they
          consider the obstacle.

                         JANUSZ
          We'll have to go 'round it.

                         VALKA
          Quicker through it.

                         JANUSZ
          They'll have dogs. Raise the
          alarm. We wouldn't stand a chance

                         VALKA
          We need food again, Pakhan.

                         JANUSZ
          I know we need food, but we're not
          going into that town, risk
          everything.
          SMITH gets up.

                         SMITH
          We're wasting time.
          He strikes off up a slope toward the hills behind the
          town.

          109 EXT.HILLS BEHIND VILLAGE - DUSK 109 


                          
          The group make their way uphill and around the town.

          A110 EXT.TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT A110

          Their P.O.V. down to the few lights of the town and the
          lake glimmering in the moonlight. From the direction of
          the town - the sound of a dog barking in an agitated
          fashion.

          AB110 EXT. HILLS BEHIND VILLAGE, SAME TIME - NIGHT AB110

          SMITH joins JANUSZ. Off his expression:

                         SMITH

                         (TO JANUSZ)
          What is it? What's wrong?

                         JANUSZ
          Where's Valka?

                         SMITH
          He was behind Zoran.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO ZORAN)
          Didn't you watch Valka?

                         ZORAN
          I'm not his keeper.

                         JANUSZ
          Damn him!
          He looks back down to the town. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
            65.

          110 EXT. THE GROUNDS OF A HOUSE, VILLAGE - NIGHT 110

          A dim light through a side window - the glimpse of a
          woman crossing through frame, followed shortly after by
          the weathered face of a fisherman. He's heard something.
          He crosses to the window, peers out into the darkness.
          The moment he turns away the camera moves on around the
          side to the rear of the building, past a rabbit in a
          cage. VALKA's shoulder comes into frame as he edges his
          way toward the back door, passing the sightless skull of
          a dried fish swinging from a cord under the eaves. He
          reaches for the door-handle, opens it, and slips silently
          inside.
          A111 EXT. TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT Alll
           A view along a road to the town. (P.O.V. now on the 
          opposite side of town to that seen earlier.)

          111 EXT.TREES, ROADSIDE - NIGHT 111


                          
           Theabove P.O.V. is that of the group waiting for VALKA.

                          
          Theysit by the roadside looking toward the town. They

                          
          swatat a cloud of mosquitoes.

                         SMITH
          He could turn us in for the
          bounty.

                         JANUSZ
          And risk arrest?

                         SMITH
          He'd bribe his way out of it.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO IRENA)
          Would he do that?

                         IRENA
          He might.

                         ZORAN
          It's an opportunity. We're rid of
          him.

                         TOMASZ
          We don't need his knife. We can
          make one from deer bone.

                         ZORAN
          Come on! Let's go!

                         (CONTTNTTRD )

                         

                         

                         

                         
           66.

                         111

                         111 CONTINUED:
          A movement behind them, they turn as VALKA steps out from
          behind a tree. He stares back at them a crooked grin on
          his face.

                         VALKA
          So.
          SMITH moves swiftly, grabs him by his collar and spins
          him into the tree.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Hey, easy cowboy!

                         SMITH
          Could have got us all killed.

                         VALKA
          You tear my coat

                         SMITH
          Fool!
          He releases him and VALKA staggers back, reaching down to
          a bulging sack. He tips out the contents - various 
          foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle
          of vodka.

                         VALKA
          'Fool' is it?
          It's then they notice blood splashed over his trousers.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          What? Did I kill you ask? Yes.
          A dog.

                         (HE LAUGHS)
          Don't believe me? So don't eat.
          But you will won't you? Because
          you want survival. I know about
          survival! All my life.
          He holds up the bottles of vodka, one half empty

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And it's my birthday!
          With a wild look in his eyes, he passes a bottle to
          JANUSZ, then flicks the side of his neck with his middle
          finger.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In Russia that means we drink!

                         

                         

                         

                         
            67.

          112 EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER - NIGHT 112

          TOMASZ tends the rabbit roasting on the fire, while the
          vodka bottle is passed hand to hand. When not drinking,
          the group are swatting at the persistent mosquitoes,
          ZORAN now badly bitten. VALKA doesn't seem bothered by
          the mosquitoes, perhaps tatoos keep them away, anyway
          he's feeling generally pleased with himself and is very
          talkative.

                         VALKA
          You know when they put the
          children of the political
          prisoners in the orphanage, they
          change their names, so later, the
          parents can never find them.

                         ZORAN
          Is that what happened to you?

                         VALKA
          (shakes his head)
          I didn't have parents. But that's
          what happened to her.
          He passes IRENA the bottle. She glares back at him.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Isn't it? You told me that.
          She glances at the puzzled faces of the others, finally
          looking at SMITH. He holds her gaze. Then she takes a
          slug of the vodka.

                         IRENA
          They called me 'Rykov', but I
          remembered our Polish name -
          'Zulinski'. I used to say it
          every night before I went to
          sleep.

                         JANUSZ
          The story you told us

                         IRENA (OVERLAP)
          I thought that story would be more
          sad, and you wouldn't leave me
          behind.
          Again she looks at SMITH. She made a promise to him.

          My parents were Polish communists.

          We lived in the Hotel Luxe with
          lots of foreign communists. But
          they arrested them. In 1937.
          Said they were spies. The police
          put me in the orphanage. And my
          brother. He died. I was ten
          years old.

                         JANUSZ
          And you ran away.
          She nods. VALKA grinning proudly at her.

                         VALKA
          She lived in the streets, like me!
          He breaks into one of his Urki songs. IRENA translates.

                         IRENA
          It's about a mother complaining to
          her son that he's a thief, just
          like his father... it goes on and
          says, 'but if you are strong
           enough to fight 'til death - you
           will conquer fate'.
           She joins VALKA in the chorus.

          113 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 113 

           The mosquitos continue to plaguethem,swirling in clouds 
           about their heads, crawling intoears,eyes and mouths. 
           They have improvised headgear -coats,swatches of 
           leaves, improvised masks. Many are badly bitten, faces 
           swollen, bites infected. SMITH walks beside JANUSZ. 

                          SMITH 
           What can we do? Steal a boat? 

                          JANUSZ 
           No. 

                          SMITH 
           People are going to get ill. 

                          JANUSZ 
           I know. 

                          SMITH 
           After all we've faced, how 
           strange, these tiny insects might 
           defeat us. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
            68A.

          A114 LATER, PLOUGHED FIELD - DAY A114 
           The group collect potatoes in a ploughed field by the 
           lake. ZORAN can no longer take the mosquitoes, and to 
           the astonishment of the others, he runs toward the water, 
           shedding his coat as he goes, eventually diving into the 
           water and submerging himself. 

          114 EXT. LAKESIDE, LATER - DAY 114 

          From a concealed position in the trees they watch as half
          a dozen peasants walk by the lake. ZORAN studies them
          intently.

                         ZORAN

                         (A WHISPER)
          No mosquitos.
          The others unsure of his meaning.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          They have no mosquitos!

                         

                         

                         

                         
            69.

          115 EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, LAKESIDE - DAY/DUSK 115

          The group have by now a walking routine which they rarely
          vary, always occupying the same positions in extended
          line. JANUSZ as navigator in the lead, SMITH generally
          bringing up the rear. IRENA is the exception - varying
          her place, now with one, now with another. They don't
          talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk
          with her. She has the knack of getting anyone to talk.
          No doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets.

          116 EXT. FOREST NEAR THE ROAD - DAY 116

           A small fire burns as TOMASZ cooks a fish stolen by 
           VALKA. The smoke from the fire is not enough to 
          alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in
          miserable silence. Suddenly SMITH throws dirt on the
          fire, suffocating it with his jacket. He points to the
          road.

          117 EXT. ROAD - DAY 117

          From their point of view a fisherman in his fifties, a 
          basket in a sling on his back, walks abreast of them on 
          the track.

          118 EXT. FOREST - DAY 118

          As he passes, ZORAN speaks in a whisper to JANUSZ.

                         ZORAN
          There it is! Again!
          JANUSZ mystified.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Look at him.
          JANUSZ stares again at the man.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          No mosquitos!
          ZORAN is up and off before anyone can stop him. They
          watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to
          the man, who regards this stranger appearing from the

          holding up the gift from the old man - strands of
          intertwined bark.

          toward the trees where the others are approaching down a
          wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to
          take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points

           Close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the 
           carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- 
           cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From 
           the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars.
           From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, 
           female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized 
           faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy.
           Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and
           from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and
           urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly 
           moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop
           to the tracks from the barred windows.
           After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the 
           woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up

          some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are
          mostly names and addresses, pleas for someone to mail or
          inform relatives of what happened to them - some have

          It's here too.

                         SMITH
          This changes everything.
          IRENA looks at the grassy plains all about them.

           The group walk toward a distant line of hills, feeling 
           very exposed to any watching eyes. 

                          ZORAN 
           How far is China? 

                          JANUSZ 
           Five, six hundred kilometers. 
           ZORAN groans. 

                          IRENA 
           Is China free? 

                          SMITH 
           There's a war on with the 
           Japanese, I know that much.

          But isn't Tibet closed to
          foreigners? I remember reading
          that.

                         VOSS
          Their religion would compel them
          to shelter us. We could go to
          Lhasa, the capital.

                         ZORAN
          We break out of one 'closed
          country' and now we plan to break
          into another? I like 'open'
          countries.
          TOMASZ and JANUSZ exchange a few excited words in Polish.
          IRENA translates.

                         IRENA
          They say we could go beyond Tibet.
          Over the mountains. To India.

                         ZORAN
          What mountains?

                         SMITH
          (shakes his head)
          The Himalayas.

                         TOMASZ
          We could join the British Army.
          First fight Nazis then Russians!

                         ZORAN
          Go over the Himalayas? How? On a
          magic carpet?
          A silence as they contemplate the massive distances

          AB136 EXT. ABANDONED STONE BUILDING, MONGOLIA - DAWN AB136 

          In the middle of an empty plain a small circular stone
          ruin.

                          

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          136 INT. RUIN - DAWN 136

          Sleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS
          opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway,
          half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily,
          takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS
          drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep
          retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase
          is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a
          knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          No! Andrejs, no!
          VOSS tries to free his arm.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Don't kill it!

                         TOMASZ
          Why not? We're hungry!

                         JANUSZ
          You want the locals after us too?
          They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of
          pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries
          it inside the ruin.

          137 INT. RUIN, LATER - DAY 137

          Milk squirting into their aluminium bowl as VOSS expertly
          milks the ewe, IRENA and ZORAN holding it steady.

          138 EXT. STEPPE - DAY 138

          The sun is blazing as they cross through a sea of grass,
          hills rising in the distance like islands.
          TOMASZ and ZORAN play a long distance walker's game -
          each in turn kicking a rock out ahead, continually
          passing it from one to the other.
          JANUSZ and SMITH look to the hills surrounding them as
          they walk.

                         JANUSZ
          You feel it?

                         SMITH
          Yes.

                         JANUSZ
          We're being watched.
          IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And
          you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a
          sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move
          watched by unseen eyes.

          A139 EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY A139

           A distant view of a temple complex at the base of low 
          hills. 

          AB139 EXT. STEPPE - DAY AB139 

           The above has been pointed out by VOSS to the group, and 
           they decide to make their way to the temple, in the hope 
           of getting food. 

          139 EXT. ABANDONED TEMPLE COMPLEX, STEPPES - DAY 139 

          Within a walled compound they wander between a series of
          recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings.
          By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may
          have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence -
          doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies
          smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of
          bullet impacts, stitched across a wall.

          140 INT. TEMPLE - DAY 140

          There are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling
          about the building makes a haunting accompaniment. IRENA
          and VOSS are alone inside.

                         IRENA
          What happened here?

                         VOSS
          The same as happened in Russia.
          Churches closed, priests shot or
          taken to camps, religion banned.
          They came to my church, in Latvia.
          Destroyed everything, declared it
          a 'museum'. Later that night,
          there was a lone guard. A boy.

          I strangled him until his eyes
          popped right out of his head.
          Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd
          killed in cold blood.
          He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand
          together in silence, but for the moaning wind.

          141 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 141

          As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts
          when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian
          horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle
          them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear
          the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age
          from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy.
          The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH,
          figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader.
          The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in
          Russian, a rough guttural accent.

          [THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE IS IN RUSSIAN.]

                         OLD MAN
          Russki?
          A glance between SMITH and JANUSZ. Much may hang on his
          answer.

                         SMITH
          No. American.
          The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he
          gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about
          that.

                         OLD MAN
          Lhasa?
          SMITH nods.

                         SMITH
          Lhasa. Yes. Tibet.
          JANUSZ points South.

                         OLD MAN
          Pilgrim?

                         SMITH
          Yes.

                         OLD MAN
          No horses?

                         SMITH
          We are too poor to have horses.
          The OLD MAN points at IRENA.

                         OLD MAN
          Wife?
          SMITH looks at IRENA.

                         SMITH
          Daughter.
          IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm
          about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation
          for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed
          by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills.
          Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as
          there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the
          riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him.
          Something about him calling her his daughter has touched
          some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles
          back.

          142 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE, MONGOLIA - DAY 142

          While SMITH fishes in the river, others tend to their
          battered feet. VOSS passes around deer fat in his
          improvised deer skull container. This they rub over raw
          patches, and between their toes where deep cracks have
          developed. JANUSZ repairs their footwear, while TOMASZ
          sits by the fire sketching IRENA. ZORAN, the camp
          barber, trims hairs and beards

          143 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 143

          TOMASZ is smoking fish over the fire as the group stir.
          He gives ZORAN a kick.

                         ZORAN
          What did you do that for? I was
          in the middle of this beautiful
          dream - just about to eat some
          salt, I could already taste it. I
          want to go back to that dream.

          144 EXT. STEPPES, MONGOLIA, LATER - DAY 144

          The figures seen walking away in the distance. Floating
          back the voice of TOMASZ giving a recipe of a favorite
          Polish dish to ZORAN.

          Then add two sprigs of rosemary
          and a pinch of nutmeg.

                         ZORAN
          Nutmeg? What about the salt?

                         TOMASZ
          We'll get to that. Now, add the
          oil and leave it to marinate,
          while you prepare the chicken.
          That's where the salt comes in...

                         ZORAN
          Good.

                         TOMASZ
          Rub it into the skin of the
          chicken with a little of the
          paprika.

                         Z ORAN
          Double the salt.

                         TOMASZ
          I can't just double the salt!
          It'll be too salty.

                         ZORAN
          I don't care, just do it.

                         TOMASZ
          I'm not going to ruin it.

          145 EXT. A CHANGING LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 145

           A primaeval and austerely beautiful landscape stretches 
          before them. Tufty knolls of dry grass are the only
          detail that break up the flat immensity.

          146 RIDGE-TOP - DAY 146
          Up ahead of them on the edge of a ridge a lone Mongolian
          horseman watches them approach. He's the young boy from
          the group of horseman who originally approached them.
          They pause before him. He looks at them a moment then
          tosses a goatskin bag at their feet before galloping off
          in the direction from which they came. VOSS picks up the
          skin bag, gives it a shake. Water.
          They continue on to the edge of the ridge and a view of a 
          vast desert plain is revealed.

          They look back to the disappearing horseman before
          scrambling down the rocky slope.

          A147 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY A147

          The group crossing into the heart of the Gobi.

          147 EXT. GOBI DESERT, LATER - DAY 147

          VOSS is the first to see it - a vast glittering lake.
          They hurry toward it.

          148 LATER, 148
          The lake leads them on, but appears no closer.

          149 LATER STILL, 149
          JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick
          method. He points out their direction - it is away from
          the beckoning lake.

                         VOSS
          Janusz!
          JANUSZ hesitates, looks at VOSS who holds up their water-
          bag.

          VOSS (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          We should go to the lake. Water
          is getting low.

                         JANUSZ
          What lake? It's a mirage.
          He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's
          little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly
          they follow.

          150 EXT. THE GOBI - MIDDAY/DUSK 150

          The sun is directly above, the land shimmering with heat
          The group have stuck their sticks in the ground and
          draped their jackets over them, making a sunshade they
          SHELTER under.

          151 LATER, 151
          The sun has dropped, casting shadows. JANUSZ rises from
          the shelter and calls for the others to continue.

          152 EXT. THE GOBI - ANOTHER DAY 152

          The figures, tiny in the surrounding desert, walk on,
          JANUSZ in the lead needing to constantly slow down to
          allow the others to catch up.

          A153 EXT. THE GOBI - SAME DAY A153

          The group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up
          ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a
          fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand.
          They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled
          together throw blankets around their shoulders and over
          their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand.
          LATER, they emerge from their own 'dune', and shaking 
          themselves down they resume their journey southward. 

          153 EXT. THE GOBI - NIGHT 153

          The temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle
          by a fire, picking sand out of their small ration of
          food.

                         ZORAN
          I'm too tired to sleep.

          Why not keep walking?

                         ZORAN
          I'm for that, if we can wake
          Andrejs.
          They look to where VOSS sleeps.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          He can sleep anywhere, any time.
          How does he do it?

                         SMITH

          Yes, but haven't you noticed?
          He points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars.

                         SMITH
          What about water?

                         JANUSZ
          What about it?

                         SMITH
          I don't see any. I'm trying to
          remember my school geography but I
          seem to recall the Gobi Desert
          somewhere in Southern Mongolia.
          JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground.
          It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch
          as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their
          cooking pot in the base.

                         JANUSZ
          We may pick up a little morning
          dew.
          Glad of something practical to do they all set about
          digging and lining holes with anything to hand.

          154 EXT. THE GOBI - DAWN 154

          As they wake, they harvest the precious droplets of water
          caught overnight, trickling the contents into their pot,
          barely a quarter cupful.

          155 EXT. GOBI - DAY 155

          No-one has slept much and they walk like zombies, strung
          out in a line, no-one speaking, all just dully
          concentrating on placing one foot after the other. ZORAN
          notices VOSS, walking behind him is actually asleep. He
          has swung his backpack onto his chest and with his head
          resting on it he is actually sleep-walking. ZORAN tests
          his theory by walking away from the group, in a small
          circle. VOSS follows, guided by the sound of ZORAN's
          footsteps. He wakes him, VOSS looking around with a
          start.

                         ZORAN
          You were asleep!

                         VOSS
          No I wasn't.

                         ZORAN
          You were following the sound of my
          footsteps - sleep-walking.
          The others have stopped. ZORAN takes the backpack from
          VOSS, and places it on the exhausted IRENA.

          Just follow the sound of my
          footsteps.
          She nods, not fully understanding.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Put all else out of your mind, and
          sleep. I'll wake you in Calcutta.
          She smiles, nods, already half asleep.

          156 EXT. GOBI, LATER - DAY 156

          ZORAN looks over his shoulder, smiles proudly as he sees
          IRENA is sleep-walking, trusting to the steady sound of
          his footsteps.

          157 EXT. GOBI MID-DAY 157

          The group rest under the meagre shade provided by their
          coats. SMITH walks away from them, and crests a slight
          rise. From here he has a clear view to the horizon. Off
          in the distance a dark patch against the light sand.
          Through the dancing mid-day light he sees shapes. Trees?
          He staggers back to the group.

                         SMITH
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ follows him to the rise. SMITH points to his
          discovery. JANUSZ squints against the light.

                         JANUSZ
          It's another mirage.
          SMITH shakes his head 'no'.

                         SMITH
          We have no more water. I see
          trees. Where there's trees
          there's water.

                         JANUSZ
          It's East. We must head South.
          The others have joined them, staring toward the distant
          shape.

                         SMITH
          I've never doubted you, Janusz.
          Not once. But we must give it a
          try.

                         JANUSZ
          No. We must keep going South!
          You'll kill us all!

                         SMITH
          Damn it, we're already dying.
          JANUSZ goes to move on, SMITH grabs his shirt sleeve, a
          short pathetic struggle sees them fall to their knees,
          VOSS and TOMASZ move to separate them. SMITH is the
          first to stand, brushing sand and dirt from his clothes.
          He turns to the others.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You have a choice.
          He looks at IRENA, then turns and goes back for his staff
          and jacket. The others watch as he turns East toward his
          discovery.

                         JANUSZ
          It's a mirage. Just a mirage.
          SMITH keeps walking away - a strange echo of the incident
          in Siberia when he walked away from the guards. Perhaps
          it is this memory that causes the others to turn
          silently, and collecting their few possessions, to follow
          him. JANUSZ watches a while, then slowly follows.

          158 EXT. THE GOBI - DAY 158

          Close on SMITH as he squints against the glare. His
          point of view:

          OASIS OR MIRAGE? THE DISTANT OUTLINE OF TREES SEEMS TO

          DISAPPEAR IN THE SHIMMERING WAVES OF LIQUID HEAT.

          REAPPEARING IN THE HEAT-SHIMMERS.

          MORE SOLID TREES.
          Back on ZORAN.

                         ZORAN
          Mirages don't have birds!
          Wider, and they're running, running with the last of
          their precious energy.

          161 EXT. WELL - DAY 161

          A clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well
          - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the
          well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring
          up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around
          rapidly.

                         SMITH
          Just a little. Don't fill
          yourselves.
          More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash
          hands and faces.
          VOSS calls from a few yards away.

                         VOSS
          Fire. Coals are still warm.
          SMITH and JANUSZ join him, examining the ground about the
          fire.

                         SMITH
          Lots of tracks. Nomads?

                         VOSS
          Maybe others will come?

                         TOMASZ
          Over here! The remains of a meal!
          There's still meat on the bones!
          He points to the cooked remains of some animal. Using
          VOSS's deer-bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones,
          others just attacking any bone they find.

          He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it
          in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack.

          162 EXT. WELL, LATER - DAY 162

          They lie stretched out under the shade of the trees
          dozing, and every now and then going back to the well to
          drink or just to lay their hands in the cool water.

          163 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 163

          IRENA sleeps while the men discuss their situation in
          hushed tones.

                         TOMASZ
          At least we have water here.

                         JANUSZ
          But no food.

                         VOSS
          Other nomads will come. Water
          their flocks.

                         JANUSZ
          When? Next week? Next month?

                         ZORAN
          We could wait a few days, at
          least.

                         JANUSZ
          Without food, we'll only get
          weaker. Maybe too weak to travel.

                         TOMASZ
          These last days - I don't know
          that I could go through that
          again.

                         VOSS
          (looks at the water)
          It was a miracle finding this.
          Can we count on another?

                         TOMASZ
          I say we stay.

          They look to SMITH. He looks up to find them watching
          him.

                         SMITH
          What are you looking at me for?
          Ask Janusz. He's already made up
          his mind for us, haven't you,
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ says nothing.

          164 EXT.WELL - DAWN 164

           They all take a last drink from the well, then pour water
           over their faces and clothes. VOSS fills the skin water-
           bag, then ZORAN fills their cooking bowl to the brim.
          Steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set
          off. ZORAN walking on tip-toe, anxiousnot to spill a
          dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand.

          THE WELL, NOW UP TO HALF A MILE BEHIND AND LOOKING LESS

          REAL IN THE SHIMMERING HEAT.

          167 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 167
          Close on VOSS, he shades his eyes to see:

          THE WELL IS BELOW THE HORIZON NOW, AND ALL THAT CAN BE

          SEEN IS THE ENDLESS FLATNESS, THE SAME EMPTINESS THAT

          STRETCHES OUT BEFORE THEM.

          168 EXT. GOBI, DESERT - TIMELAPSE - DAY 168 

          They walk in a desert void. There are no features, no
          distant hills, no growth of any kind. It is an
          emptiness, the only sound that of their footsteps and
          their labored breathing.

          from ZORAN's bowl long gone, the goat-skin water-bag no
          longer sloshes, but has to be squeezed to get out even a
          mouthful.

          JANUSZ hands out small portions of the scavenged meat
          from the waterhole.
          All of them are subject to cramps, the result of the lack
          of water, and from time to time they are seen reacting to
          a sudden bolt of pain, attempting to stretch against it,
          or massage the limb out of its paralysis.

          170 LATER, SAME CAMPSITE - NIGHT 170 
          SMITH and JANUSZ collect more dried camel dung for the
          fire. SMITH looks to where the others sit.

          We're in trouble.

                         JANUSZ

          Days?

                         JANUSZ

          heat.

                         SMITH
          What about what we're getting from
          condensation?

                         JANUSZ
          It's the only thing keeping us
          alive. But for how long?

          As they walk VOSS picks up a pebble, holds it up to show
          ZORAN who walks behind him.

                         VOSS
          When we worked the fields, during
          the hot summers, we used to suck
          on small stones like these. Don't
          know why but it made us feel less
          thirsty.
          ZORANpicks up a pebble.

                         ZORAN
          We've eaten just about everything
          else.

                         VOSS
          You don't eat it, just suck on it.
          At this moment IRENA falls again, her knees buckling and
          her face pitching into the sand in almost one movement.
          They turn her over again, wiping the sand from her nose
          and mouth. SMITH makes a shelter over her with their
          sticks and jackets. She lies with her eyes closed, her
          breathing coming in harsh gasps. Both legs are now
          swollen to the knees. He touches the swelling and the 
          marks his fingers make remain for some seconds.

                         VOSS (CONT'D)
          Sunstroke?
          IRENA wakes.

                         IRENA
          I'm becoming a nuisance.
          She looks down at her legs.

                         JANUSZ
          Do they hurt you?

                         IRENA
          No, not at all. They must be
          swelling because I've walked so
          far. Don't you think, Mister?
          SMITH nods reassuringly then quickly turns away, a look 
          of deep anguish passing across his face.

          173 EXT. GOBI - NIGHT 173

          The others keep watch over her as she sleeps. SMITH
          passes around a splash of water in the cup. They all
          refuse it.

                         ZORAN
          Save it for Irena. We've got our
          pebbles.
          And he pops one in his mouth, makes out it's delicious
          and soothing.
          In the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the
          sand, lining them with their jackets, hopeful of
          collecting a little moisture overnight.

          174 EXT. GOBI - DAWN 174

          They walk on, ZORAN carefully carrying the partly filled
          bowl of water. IRENA seems refreshed, but JANUSZ and
          SMITH walk beside her, watching her every step.

                         IRENA
          I can walk alright if I can lean a
          little on you.
          They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow.

          175 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 175 

          IRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she
          walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling
          to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS
          hurries back to them.

                         JANUSZ
          Can you go on?

                         IRENA
          I think so. But what about Mr.
          Smith?
          SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving
          them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and
          half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but
          it's no use, she's lost all her strength.

                         VOSS
          I'm going to carry her.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

          178 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY 178

          A lizard, in close up, listens to an approaching sound.
          As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too,
          has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a
          battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the
          foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls
          through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath
          coming in short gasps.

          179 EXT. WIDER, GOBI DESERT - DAY 179 

          The five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in
          line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the
          strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him,
          calls to the others.
          CLOSE on TOMASZ.
          He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the
          tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As
          JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers
          to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm
          they continue.

          180 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 180

          As they walk the landscape changes from the endless
          scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the
          terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on
          the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the
          wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie
           singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive 
           dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, 
           staring in horror - 

                          TOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: 
           The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a 
           massive sand wave.
           Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious. 

          181 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - TWILIGHT 181 

           An eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting 
           together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to 
          revive as he passes around sketches he's made during
          their imprisonment and escape.

                         181 CONTINUED: 181
          It's an almost cheerful scene, like a traveller showing
          happy snaps taken on holiday.

                         VOSS
          I like this one. When did you do
          that?
          He holds up a sketch of KAZIK, showing him examining one 
          of his battered shoes.

                         TOMASZ
          On the train. Poor Kazik, always 
          the trouble with his feet. 
          ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself.

                         ZORAN
          Who's this?

                         TOMASZ
          You.
          ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked.

                         ZORAN
          My father maybe, but is that
          how I look now?
          A chuckle from the others.
          SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA.

                         SMITH
          You caught her smile. 
          SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back
          down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He
          knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn
          has given strength to his friends, and between them all
          is a feeling of love and a kind of peace.

          182 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - DAWN 182 

          They've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it
          from the top of the cross over his grave. A faint breath
          of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum, the
          others long gone.

          183 EXT. DUNES - DAY 183

          As they stagger on JANUSZ has moved well out in front,
          when he stumbles and falls. Then he sees it, just out
          ahead, and he begins crawling toward it.

          JANUSZ'S MIRAGE - DAY:
          It's the hedge and gate from his vision. Behind the
          hedge the hint of a roof. Through the gate can be seen
          the path to the front door.

          184 EXT. DUNES - DAY 184

          JANUSZ crawling faster now, when ZORAN appears beside
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          Do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          Come on, Jan.

                         JANUSZ
          But do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          No.
          He helps him to his feet and they continue on.

          185 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 185

          In the glare of the noon-day sun they shelter under
          their coats propped on their walking staffs. No-one
          speaks.

          186 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 186

          SMITH and JANUSZ support each other as they stagger on.
          SMITH's eyes are on the ground, following the dancing
          shadows before him. JANUSZ nudges him, points - above
          them two magnificent eagles, the source of the shadows.

                         JANUSZ
          Eagles live in mountains.
          SMITH looks at the featureless landscape ahead.

                         SMITH
          They also fly long distances.

          187 EXT. LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 187

          The dunes are more intermittent here, the ground more
          stony and undulating.

          VOSS hears it first, and with his remaining strength
          moves out of the circle of firelight into the desert. He
          pauses, listens again.
          A scraping sound. Then he sees them coming out of the
          gloom - JANUSZ dragging an unconscious SMITH by his
          shoulders. VOSS hurries to them. A look from JANUSZ -
          'water'? VOSS shakes his head, 'No'.

          190 EXT. CAMPSITE - SAME - DAWN 190

          A black snake, thick as your wrist, slides over ZORAN'S
          leg. He stares, too close to death to feel fear. He's
          not even entirely sure it's real. He watches its
          progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside. Then he
          gets it, and he's up, running on pure adrenaline,
          following after the snake, leaving his sleeping
          companions by the fire.

          191 EXT. HILLSIDE - BRIEF MONTAGE - DAY 191

          ZORAN tracking the snake. He mutters to himself in a
          kind of delirium. He is crawling after the snake,
          scraping skin from knees and elbows. The snake disappears
          down into a rocky defile, followed by ZORAN.

          192 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY 192

          SMITH in a death-like sleep. A distance away VOSS and
          JANUSZ stand, staring upward at the waving figure some
          fifty metres up the hill. A native? Black mud obscures
          his face. It's ZORAN. He waves, dances about, then in a
          cracked voice, a single word drifts down to them.

                         ZORAN
          Water!

          193 EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY 193

          ZORAN, JANUSZ, VOSS - lie flat out like lizards, their
          faces in damp, black mud. Sucking sounds. They slurp at
          small pools of water, split lips, puffed and bleeding.
          At first, just to swallow is painful, but it is life.
          After each mouthful there is a moment they must wait as
          the seepage re-fills the little hollows.

          194 EXT. MUD-POOLS - LATER - DAY 194

          They've carried SMITH to the water and JANUSZ supports
          him in a sitting position while VOSS and ZORAN, in turn,
          soak their shirts in the mud, dripping the life-giving
          liquid into SMITH'S mouth. He coughs, splutters, as he
          sucks at the moisture.

          195 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE VALLEY - DAY 195

          A black snake protruding about a foot out of a hole in
          the sandy soil. ZORAN points, and is joined by JANUSZ
          and VOSS. JANUSZ holds his hand up for them to go very
          still. He speaks in a whisper.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VOSS passes him the deer-bone knife. With it, he splits
          the end of his staff, to make a fork out of the end.

                         Z ORAN
          What if it's poisonous?

                         JANUSZ
          You can still eat it. Just cut
          off its head.
          He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the
          creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the
          snake in the fork. Too slow. The snake disappears into
          its hole.

          196 EXT. VALLEY - LATER - DAY 196

          Like snake-fishermen, they sit waiting bythe snake-hole
          - ZORAN too, has a snake-catching stick. Then they see a
          second snake, slithering across the rocks. At a signal
          they strike, ZORAN deftly trapping the snake's head in
          the cleft stick.

          JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of
          meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground
          too tired to eat.

                         VOSS
          Kind of like chicken.

                         ZORAN
          Yeah, a long black poisonous
          chicken with no legs.

                         JANUSZ
          You know Valka talked of eating
          each other? In Siberia?

                         ZORAN
          He did? Would you have eaten me?

                         JANUSZ
          Probably.

                         ZORAN
          I would never have eaten you - too
          stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat
          snake.
          VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth,
          pulls out a tooth.

                         JANUSZ

          The fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes
          from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink.
          SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks
          in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort.

                         SMITH
          It can kill you, remember?
          JANUSZ puzzled.

          'Kindness'.
          JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives
          him away.

          you can't can you? You're a fool.
          I'd leave you.
          He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and
          suffering etched in sharp lines.

          Irena told you.

          He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ,
          an ironic smile on his lips.

                         JANUSZ
          So why didn't you kill yourself?

                         SMITH
          Survival was a kind of protest.
          JANUSZ makes him take a little water.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Now being alive is my punishment.

                         JANUSZ
          Punishment for what?

                         SMITH
          I brought David to Russia didn't

          I?

                         JANUSZ
          And no-one can forgive you? And
          you can't forgive yourself?

                         SMITH
          Be easier if I had religion, or a
          home to go back to, like you.

                         JANUSZ
          For us, the old life is gone.
          They sit in silence for a while.

                         SMITH
          Irena told me they tortured your
          wife and she informed on you.

                         JANUSZ
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          They did that to my boy.

                         JANUSZ

                         (NODS)
          My wife was released, that much I
          know. She lived, but like you she
          won't be able to forgive herself.
          Only I can do that.
          He leans closer to SMITH, speaks just above a whisper,
           his voice intense, his eyes burning.

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D)
           She'll torture herself for what
           she did. Just like you. That's
           why I have to get back!

                          (CONTTNTTFT) 1

                         199 CONTINUED: ( 3) 199
          This last, has impressed SMITH, and despite his death-
          wish a flicker of life surges through his bones.

          200 EXT. CAMPSITE, MUD-FLAT - DAWN 200

          Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in
          wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One
          figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk
          slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH.
          The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of
          SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to
          walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to
          him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack
          with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of
          water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water-
          bag.

          201 EXT. DESERT - DAY 201

          JANUSZ catches up with SMITH, giving him his arm in
          support, and together they slowly continue their journey
          Southward.

          202 EXT. CHANGING TERRAIN - DAY 202

          They leave the desert behind as they climb gently rising
          ground.

          203 RIVER, MONGOLIA - DAY 203
          The survivors each seen alone as they experience the life-
          giving water: one simply lets water run though his
          fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks,
          savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage
          wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch
          gleam silver in the light.

                         204 - OMIT 

          205 EXT. HILLSIDE - DUSK/NIGHT 205

           Walking abreast they head toward a pass between two 
           massive mountains - in the distance gleaming snow-capped 
           peaks rise even higher. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          206 EXT. CAMPSITE, MOUNTAINS - DAWN 206 

          They sleep, huddled together amongst the stony rubble.
          It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks
          about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake,
          pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall
          towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's
          in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud
          bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the
          outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the
          horizon - the Great Wall of China.

          207 EXT. THE GREAT WALL, CHINA - DAY 207

           They enter through a keyhole-like opening formed by
           collapsed masonry, now dressed in their cold weather
          clothing.

          208 EXT. SKY - DAY 208

          From high above a series of aerial shots take us over a
          massive snow covered mountain range. 

          209 EXT. SNOWY LANDSCAPE, TIBET - DAY 209

          The men climb steadily up snow-covered hills, pausing at
          a cairn of stones covered with tiny flags.

                         SMITH
          Tibetan?
          They move on with renewed energy.

          210 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, TIBET - DAY 210

          CLOSE on the deeply lined face of a SHEPHERD. He wears
          Tibetan costume and squints his eyes as he stares into
          the distance.
          From his P.O.V., four distant figures walking across the
          snowy plain toward him. The sound of dogs barking.

          211 EXT. A RIDGE NEAR THE SHEPHERD'S HUT - DUSK 211

          Far below in a valley lies the legendary Lhasa - the
          stepped palace and surrounding town burnished by the last
          of the golden light. A sprinkling of lights come on as
          the shadows lengthen.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         211 CONTINUED: 211
          Above and beyond, like a massive wall, rise the snow-
          capped peaks of the Himalayas. This has been theview
          stretching out before the four fugitives andtheirtour-
          guide, the old shepherd. As if pointing outthechoice
          confronting them, he labels each of these spectacular
          features.

                         SHEPHERD

                         (POINTING DOWN)
          Lhasa LHA-SA!
          Then, indicating 'over' the mountains -

                          SHEPHERD (CONT'D)

          IN-DI-A!
          In dumb-show, he mines that the mountains would be very
          cold.

          212 EXT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 212

          Three horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its
          associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with
          much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who
          follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They
          stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four
          survivors sit at a table, surrounded by bowls and plates
           of food. 

          213 INT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 213

          The LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is
          served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and
          as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR.

          SMITH.

                         OFFICIAL
          India? Yes. There is the track
          to Sikkim, over the mountains.
          Many people go there.

                         SMITH
          And food?

                         OFFICIAL
          Small villages there. They give
          food. Wood for fire. Yes, but
          you don't go now.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         213 CONTINUED: 213

                         JANUSZ
          Why can't we go now?

                         OFFICIAL
          If big snow come - very difficult.
          You wait here until Spring. This
          family keep you.
          He confers with the LAMA.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO SMITH)
          That's three months.

                         OFFICIAL
          (indicates the LAMA)
          He go to Lhasa. Get permission
          for to stay. Only to Spring. Not
          possible foreigners stay Tibet.
          SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group
          doing likewise.

          214 INT. STABLES, SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 214

          THE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their
          quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires
          with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered
          floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets
          given to them by the shepherd's wife.

                         ZORAN
          Well, we can't cross in Winter.

                         JANUSZ
          He said it was 'difficult'.
          SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped
          space.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to sleep 'till Spring.
          Like a bear in a cave. What about
          you, Mister?
          SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his
          sheepskin.

                         SMITH
          I'm going to Lhasa.
          The others are stunned by this.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         214 CONTINUED: 214

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          The Lama has a contact - maybe get
          me out through China. There's a
          U.S. military mission there.
          They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them,
          breaking up the team.

                         ZORAN
          'Looking after number one.' Isn't
          that what Americans say?

                         SMITH
          Zoran?
          ZORAN eventually looks at him.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We escaped. We made it.
          VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small
          window.

                         ZORAN
          He's right. I just realized it.

                         VOSS
          Realized what?

                         ZORAN
          Apart from a few mountains, we're
          there. We made it.

                         VOSS
          Not all of us.

                         ZORAN
          No. Not all of us.
          Their thoughts drift back to their lost companions.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          What will you do, Mister? When
          you get home.

                         SMITH
          'Home'?

                         Z ORAN
          Build metros?

                         SMITH
          Might drift for a while.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         ZORAN

                         (LAUGHS)
          Haven't you had enough of that?
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, hardly listening, his thoughts
          elsewhere. Their late-night conversation drifts over
          him.

                         VOSS
          I will fight. First Germans, then
          Russians.

                         ZORAN
          Then re-build your church?

                         VOSS
          I will die fighting.
          This statement has an oddly prophetic sound. JANUSZ look
          across at him.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to get Tomasz's pictures
          to a newspaper, or get them
          published somehow. Then I'm going
          to cook his chicken - but with
          extra salt just to annoy him.
          Chuckles from the group. 

                         SMITH
          And you, Janusz? 

          VOSS (TO SMITH) 
          As long as the Communists are in 
          Poland, he can't go back. 

                         ZORAN 
          They'd shoot you wouldn't they, 
          Janusz? 
          They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking 
          up. 

                         JANUSZ 
          I'll just keep on going. Until
          it's over. Keep on walking.
          SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits -
          moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't
          quite see his eyes.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep.

                         215 - OMIT 

          216 INT. STABLES - DAWN 216

          ZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has
          gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut,
          checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH
          remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the
          wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected
          nothing less. 

          217 EXT. HIMALAYAS - DAY 217

          Up ahead a figure, JANUSZ, dwarfed by the mountain chain,
          struggles on, climbing toward the snow-capped passes.

          218 EXT. HIGHER PASS DAY 218

          As he climbs he hears a cry, mingling with that of the
          wind - a voice echoing about the mountains. He ignores
          it for a few paces, before he looks back - far below two
          figures waving and calling - VOSS and ZORAN.

          219 EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE/VALLEY, TIBET/INDIA - DAWN 219

          The change from the barren mountains of Tibet, to the
          lush green of Sikkim is abrupt and startling - from rocky
          upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in
          scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest,
          until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a
          backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look
          up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking
          bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost
          of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on
          their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They
          walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive.
          Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a
          POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while
          some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting
          into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their
          grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?

          220 EXT. VALLEY PATH, INDIA - DAY 220

          Close on JANUSZ, VOSS, and ZORAN as the beaming POLICEMAN
          escorts them past dozens of smiling faces.

                         220 CONTINUED: 220
          This being India, a small crowd of the curious rapidly
          swells, until the path is lined two and three deep on
          either side, like a welcoming crowd at the end of a
          marathon. Small children are held up for a better look,
          while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders -
          it's as if they know these men have achieved something
          remarkable.
          Close on JANUSZ, as amongst the sound of the gathering
          crowd other voices join in, cheering voices, hundreds of
          them, rising in volume until the cheering changes into
          that of a chant, now seemingly swelled by thousands of
          voices. Still CLOSE on JANUSZ walking as behind him the
          Indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white
          images. (Throughout, the image of JANUSZ walking is from
          this scene in India).

          221 EXT. A HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 221

          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of
          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the
          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The
          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind
          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed
          open.

          222 INT. HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 222

          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
          hand in his.

          FADE TO BLACK.
