                         While we read this, a pair of hands 
                         come in holding pneumatic chisel which 
                         immediately attacks the sign. As the

                         Med. shot: At a door at which a sign-painter 
                         works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's 
                         name on the door. It opens and a flip 
                         office boy emerges. The painter has 
                         to wait until the door closes in order 
                         to resume his work.
                                      
                         Full shot: Of the outer office. The 
                         activity of the office seems to suddenly 
                         cease, as all eyes are centered on the 
                         office boy.
                                      
                         Med. shot—panning: With the office boy—who 
                         has a small sheet of paper in his hand. 
                         He walks jauntily to a desk, refers 
                         to his paper, points his finger to a 
                         woman, emits a short whistle through 
                         his teeth, runs a finger across his 
                         throat and jerks his thumb toward managing 
                         editor's office. The woman stares starkly 
                         at him while her immediate neighbors 
                         look on with sympathy. The office boy 
                         now goes through the same procedure 
                         with several other people. All watch 
                         him, terror written in their eyes.
 
                                                              
                         Med. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door 
                         where painter works. It opens and three 
                         people emerge. Two men and a girl. The 
                         girl is young and pretty. All three 
                         look dourful. The painter again has 
                         to wait for the door to shut before 
                         resuming his work. The two men exit. 
                         The girl suddenly stops.
                                      
                         Close shot: Of the girl. Her name is 
                         ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, 
                         and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels 
                         around. Camera pans with her as she 
                         returns to CONNELL's office door, flings 
                         it open and disappears. The painter 
                         remains poised with his brush, waiting 
                         for the door to swing back. There is 
                         a slight flash of resentment in his 
                         eyes.

                         of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half 
                         gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another 
                         veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to

                         dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, 
                         twenty if necessary. I'll do anything 
                         you say.

                         Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better 
                         finish this column.

                         Suddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes 
                         widen as a fiendish idea strikes her.

                         She flops down in front of her typewriter.

                         She begins to pound furiously, her jaw 
                         set.

                         speed of her typing causes him to stare 
                         dumbly at her.
                                      
                         Med. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally 
                         she finishes. She whips the sheet out 
                         of the typewriter, hands it to JOE.

                         "Below is a letter which reached my 
                         desk this morning. It's a commentary 
                         on what we laughingly call the civilized 
                         world. 'Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years 
                         ago I was fired out of my job. Since 
                         then I haven't been able to get another 
                         one. At first I was sore at the state 
                         administration because it's on account 
                         of the slimy politics here we have all 
                         this unemployment. But in looking around, 
                         it seems the whole world's going to 
                         pot, so in protest I'm going to commit 
                         suicide by jumping off the City Hall 
                         roof!' Signed, A disgusted American

                         JOE pauses to absorb this.

                         JOE glances up toward ANN, in mild protest.

                         it?
                                      
                         Full shot: ANN has just about accumulated 
                         all her things. JOE stares at her, knowing 
                         it's a fake.

                         JOE shrugs, shakes his head, and exits. 
                         ANN stuffs her things under her arm 
                         and also goes.

                         ANN comes out. Suddenly, she stops, 
                         gets another idea, picks up a book from 
                         a desk, and reaches back to heave it.

                         wiping his brushes, the book flies in. 
                         The painter lifts his head slowly, his 
                         wrath too great to find utterance.

                         and his brother and sister out looking 
                         for him. Did you see the box I'm running?

                         He picks up the front page of the Bulletin; 
                         we see a four column box on the front 
                         page.

                         get his sign painted. He reaches in—and 
                         pulls the door to.

                         Hey, do you know something? She supports 
                         a mother and two kids. What do you know 
                         about that?

                         No. Her mother's awful worried about 
                         her. When she left the house she said 
                         she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, 
                         the girl, I mean!

                         feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So 
                         what does he do? He decides to commit 
                         suicide in protest against the state 
                         of civilization. He thinks of the river! 
                         But no, no, he has a better idea. The 
                         City Hall. Why? Because he wants to 
                         attract attention. He wants to get a 
                         few things off his chest, and that's

                         by John Doe." He protests against all 
                         the evils in the world; the greed, the 
                         lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's 
                         inhumanity to man.
                                      
                         Arguments will start. Should he commit 
                         suicide or should he not! People will 
                         write in pleading with him. But no!

                         it any more, rises, throws his brush 
                         violently to the floor—after completely 
                         smearing the sign himself.

                         this little document. You'll find it 
                         says, er: "I, Ann Mitchell, hereby certify

                         the paper and starts to read. Ann leans

                         chance than a road-rabbit.

                         (dogging the COLONEL)
                                     
                         Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?

                         Say, is this one of those places where 
                         you ring if you want something?

                         Yeah. Just use the phone.
                                     
                         The thought of this delights JOHN.

                         a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody 
                         bothers you—hundreds of people pass 
                         yuh by in every line of business—shoes, 
                         hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, 
                         everything. They're all nice, lovable 
                         people, and they let you alone. Is that

                         Then you get hold of some dough, and 
                         what happens?
                                      
                         BEANY instinctively shakes his head.

                         They begin creeping up on you—trying 
                         to sell you something. They've got long 
                         claws and they get a strangle-hold on 
                         you—and you squirm—and duck and holler—and 
                         you try to push 'em away—but you haven't 
                         got a chance—they've got you! First 
                         thing you know, you own things. A car, 
                         for instance.
                                      
                         BEANY has been following him, eyes blinking, 
                         mouth open.

                         Now your whole life is messed up with 
                         more stuff—license fees—and number plates—and 
                         gas and oil—and taxes and insurance—

                         One of them listens with a half-smile 
                         on his face. The other, more goofy, 
                         looks bewildered. He has been listening—and 
                         now, slowly rises, ears cocked, frightened 
                         by the harrowing tale. Camera retreats 
                         before him—as he slowly walks nearer 
                         to BEANY and the COLONEL. Meantime, 
                         we continue to hear the COLONEL'S voice.

                         are close together—both staring at the 
                         COLONEL.

                         And a million and one other things. 
                         And what happens? You're not the free 
                         and happy guy you used to be. You gotta 
                         have money to pay for all those things—so 
                         you go after what the other feller's 
                         got—
                                      
                         (with finality)

                         and the LUG. They continue to stare, 
                         wide-eyed, at the COLONEL.

                         break. See that Miss Mitchell gets a

                         reading something she has written. Suddenly, 
                         impulsively, she yanks the sheet out 
                         of the machine and flings it to the 
                         floor. As she rises, camera pulls back. 
                         We find the floor littered with previously 
                         unsuccessful attempts to get the speech 
                         written. For a moment, ANN paces agitatedly, 
                         until she is interrupted by a commotion.

                         Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get 
                         it to jell! I created somebody who's 
                         gonna give up his life for a principle, 
                         hundreds of thousands of people are 
                         gonna listen to him over the radio and,

                         listen.

                         Darling, there are so many complaining 
                         political speeches. People are tired 
                         of hearing nothing but doom and despair 
                         on the radio. If you're going to have 
                         him say anything, why don't you let 
                         him say something simple and real, something 
                         with hope in it? If your father were 
                         alive, he'd know what to say.

                         pitch without the windup.

                         When a guy has a woman on his hands—the 
                         first thing he knows his life is balled 
                         up with a lot more things—furniture 
                         and—
                                      
                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the 
                         "ball"—gets into position—nods to his 
                         catcher—raises his hands in the air, 
                         takes a peek toward first base—and suddenly 
                         wheels around facing camera, and whips 
                         the "ball" toward first base. Almost 
                         immediately his face lights up.

                         Full shot: JOHN flips the glove off 
                         his hand so that it dangles from his 
                         wrist—and massages the ball with his 
                         two palms.

                         positions, the LUG, from outside, partly 
                         opens the door.

                         the Chronicle snooping around out here!

                         As they reach the door, the LUG speaks 
                         to ANGELFACE.

                         and grins mischievously. He starts winding 
                         up for another pitch.

                         You've got swell form. Must have been 
                         a pretty good pitcher.

                         Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready 
                         for the major leagues when I chipped 
                         a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' 
                         a nineteen-inning game!

                         Yep. There was a major league scout 
                         there watching me, too. And he came 
                         down after the game with a contract. 
                         Do you know what? I couldn't life my 
                         arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again 
                         as soon as I get it fixed up.

                         Well, you know how they are in baseball—if 
                         a guy's mixed up in a racket—

                         John Doe business. Why, as soon as it 
                         comes out it's all a fake, you'll be

                         in love with him.
                                      
                         Full shot: They are interrupted by the 
                         arrival of CONNELL. He is accompanied 
                         by several photographers—and a beautiful 
                         girl in a bathing suit. A banner across 
                         her front reads: "Miss Average Girl".

                         come on—plenty of oomph!
                                      
                         The GIRL, all smiles, throws her arms 
                         around JOHN's shoulder—and strikes a 
                         languid pose. The flashlights go off.

                         While there is this confusion, the COLONEL 
                         pushes in and stands in the doorway.

                         the COLONEL out of the way and enter 
                         the room. The COLONEL glances down—and 
                         nearly jumps out of his skin. BEANY 
                         follows them in.

                         on each of JOHN's arms. The flashlights

                         Never mind. Let him alone. He's all 
                         right. I'll be right over there pulling 
                         for you.
                                      
                         JOHN starts to follow ANN away from 
                         mike. ANN leads him back to mike again.

                         tries the door, to see that it opens 
                         readily. Standing near him is BEANY 
                         and the others.

                         man with the earphones on has his hand 
                         up ready to give the signal. He listens 
                         a moment, then abruptly drops his hand.

                         And good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
                         This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the 
                         New Bulletin . Tonight we give you something 
                         entirely new and different. Standing 
                         beside me is the young man who has declared 
                         publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends 
                         to commit suicide, giving as his reason—quote: 
                         "I protest against the state of civilization." 
                         End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the 
                         New Bulletin takes pleasure in presenting 
                         the man who is fast becoming the most 
                         talked-of person in the whole country, 
                         JOHN DOE!
                                      
                         The man next to him waves his hand—there 
                         is an outburst of music.
                                      
                         A flash: Of ANN—she looks at JOHN intently.
 
                                                              
                         Med. shot: Group around BEANY. They 
                         all applaud, except for MIKE and the 
                         COLONEL. MIKE, with his hand hanging 
                         down, nudges the COLONEL.

                         Close shot: Of their hands meeting and 
                         we see the envelope change hands. Camera 
                         pans up to the COLONEL's face which 
                         is twisted into a miserable grimace.
 
                                                              
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He glances around, 
                         uncertainly.
                                      
                         Close shot: Of MIKE and the COLONEL. 
                         MIKE elbows the COLONEL to throw his 
                         signal. The COLONEL looks toward JOHN 
                         and nods his head.
                                      
                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the 
                         COLONEL'S signal and quickly his hand 
                         goes to his pocket. Just as he is about 
                         to bring it out, his hand pauses. He 
                         turns and looks at ANN.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. A warm, pleading look 
                         in her eyes.
                                      
                         Med. shot: Around JOHN. He is still 
                         staring at ANN, when the ANNOUNCER reaches 
                         over and nudges him—pointing to the 
                         mike. JOHN snaps out of it—turns his 
                         face to the mike—pushes the paper back 
                         in his pocket—and starts reading ANN'S 
                         speech.

                         Ladies and gentlemen: I am the man you 
                         all know as John Doe.
                                      
                         (clearing his throat)
                                     
                         I took that name because it seems to 
                         describe—because it seems to describe
 
                                                              
                         (his voice unnatural)
                                     
                         the average man, and that's me.
                                     
                         (repeats, embarrassedly)
                                     
                         And that's me.
                                     
                         Med. shot: The COLONEL and MIKE. The 
                         COLONEL realizes JOHN is not going to 
                         make SPENCER'S speech, and his face 
                         breaks into a broad grin. He takes MIKE'S 
                         hand and slaps the envelope into his 
                         palm. Over the shot we hear JOHN'S voice.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN'S VOICE
                                     
                         Well, it was me—before I said I was 
                         gonna jump off the City Hall roof at 
                         midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I guess 
                         I'm not average any more. Now, I'm getting 
                         all sorts of attention, from big shots, 
                         too.

                         to him and hands him envelope.
                                      
                         MIKE
                                     
                         (whispering)
                                     
                         We've been double-crossed!
                                     
                         SPENCER stares at the envelope, frothing 
                         at the mouth.

                         The Mayor and the Governor, for instance. 
                         They don't like those articles I've 
                         been writing.
                                      
                         Suddenly they are startled by SPENCER's 
                         voice.
                                      
                         SPENCER'S VOICE
                                     
                         You're an imposter, young fella! That's 
                         a pack of lies you're telling!

                         (pointing accusing finger at JOHN)

                         far as he gets. Several attendants, 
                         BEANY among them, have reached him and 
                         start throwing him out.

                         he's wise. He's inherently honest, but 
                         he's got a streak of larceny in his 
                         heart. He seldom walks up to a public

                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes go from JOHN 
                         to the audience—as she watches their 
                         reaction.

                         JOHN
                                     
                         Now, why can't that spirit, that same 
                         warm Christmas spirit last the whole 
                         year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if 
                         each and every John Doe would make that 
                         spirit last three hundred and sixty-five 
                         days out of the year, we'd develop such 
                         a strength, we'd create such a tidal 
                         wave of good will, that no human force 
                         could stand against it.

                         affected by the speech himself.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Yes, sir, my friends, the meek can only 
                         inherit the earth when the John Does 
                         start loving their neighbors. You'd 
                         better start right now. Don't wait till 
                         the game is called on account of darkness! 
                         Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of 
                         the world!
                                      
                         He has finished—but does not move. He 
                         drops his head to conceal the moisture 
                         in his eyes.

                         seated. Her moist eyes riveted on JOHN.

                         realize it is over—and gradually they

                         radio station rings with cheers.

                         the COLONEL has been on guard.

                         leaving, follows and tries to stop them, 
                         but her efforts are unsuccessful.

                         is building a fire.

                         Long shot: Shooting from their view 
                         through the store window. In the street 
                         outside, a delivery wagon is passing. 
                         On its side is a sign reading "JOIN 
                         THE JOHN DOE CLUB".

                         Close shot: Of the WAITER standing near 
                         the coffee urn. From back of it he has 
                         taken a local paper—on the front page 
                         of which is JOHN's picture. The WAITER 
                         looks at it and then turns his head 
                         to JOHN.

                         turn and see the waiter watching them 
                         peculiarly.

                         JOHN lowers his head.

                         Oh, no. I'd know that voice anywhere. 
                         You can't kid me! You're John Doe! Hey,

                         JOHN gives the COLONEL the office and 
                         they hastily exit. Several customers, 
                         who had gathered around, now evince 
                         interest. DAN identifies JOHN as JOHN 
                         DOE, and the people follow JOHN out 
                         into the street. DAN hastily seizes 
                         the phone.

                         as they hurry away, being followed by 
                         the crowd which is gradually growing 
                         larger . . . as we see people crossing

                         crowded with people. Those near the 
                         entrance are trying to force their way 
                         in. MAYOR HAWKINS guards the door.

                         all anxious to see John Doe. We're all 
                         neighbors, but my office is packed like 
                         a sardine box.

                         type of men. No, you can't see him.

                         Now, everybody on your dignity. Don't 
                         do anything to disgrace us. This is

                         Mr. Norton! I'm Mayor Hawkins. Your 
                         office telephoned me to hold him.

                         Well, that's fine. How is he?
                                     
                         MAYOR
                                     
                         Oh, he's fine. He's right in my office 
                         there. You know, this is a great honor 
                         having John Doe here, and you too. Haven't 
                         had so much excitement since the old 
                         city hall burned down.

                         People were so excited, they nearly 
                         tore his clothes off.

                         Tell them Mr. Norton is here. Step right 
                         inside, Mr. Norton—my office is very 
                         comfortable here, Mr. Norton. Just had 
                         it air-conditioned. Gangway, please. 
                         Make room for Mr. Norton. Gangway, gangway. 
                         Here he is, Mr. Norton, well taken care 
                         of. The neighbors are serving him a 
                         light lunch.

                         in full uniform and several policemen.

                         Mister Mayor, if you don't mind, we'd 
                         like to talk to him alone.

                         everybody, clear out.
                                      
                         They all start to shuffle out—the MAYOR 
                         excitedly egging them on.

                         Don't argue with me here. Wait till 
                         we get home.
                                      
                         WIFE
                                     
                         Don't you push me around like that! 
                         Even though I'm your wife, you can't 
                         push me around—
                                      
                         MAYOR

                         They all shuffle out, and D.B. shuts 
                         the door. JOHN watches him, doesn't 
                         like his proprietary manner.

                         a lot of nerve having those people hold 
                         us here.

                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, if there's nobody holding us here, 
                         let's get going. Incidentally, my name 
                         isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.

                         happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. 
                         We know of eight already and they say 
                         that there's going—

                         of being stopped either.

                         thing is. You should see the thousands 
                         of telegrams we've received and what 
                         they're saying about you.

                         but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants 
                         to get back of it and sponsor John Doe 
                         Clubs all over the country. He wants

                         Why, certainly. With your ability to 
                         influence people, it might grow into 
                         a glorious movement.

                         I don't want any part of this thing. 
                         If you've got an idea I'm going around 
                         lecturing to people, why you're crazy! 
                         Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking 
                         to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out 
                         of here.

                         The beaming COLONEL starts to follow

                         the door suddenly flies open and a crowd 
                         of townspeople push their way in—with

                         hold them back.

                         No stampeding. Walk slow, like you do

                         we heard your broadcast, and we got 
                         quite a bang out of it, especially my 
                         wife.

                         Kept me up half the night saying "That 
                         man's right, honey. The trouble with 
                         the world is—nobody gives a hoot about 
                         his neighbor. That's why everybody in 
                         town's sore and cranky at each other."
 
                                                              
                         And I kept saying, "Well, that's fine, 
                         but how's a guy gonna go around loving 
                         the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss 
                         for instance!"

                         You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy 
                         who lives all alone next door to us. 
                         He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand 
                         furniture store. We haven't spoken to 
                         him for years. I always figured he was 
                         an ornery old gent that hated the world 
                         cause he was always slamming his garage 
                         door and playing the radio so loud he 
                         kept half the neighbors up.

                         Well, anyway, the next morning I'm out 
                         watering the lawn and I look over and 
                         there's Sourpuss on the other side of 
                         the hedge straightening out a dent in 
                         his fender and, er, my wife yells to 
                         me out of the window. She says, "Go 
                         on. Speak to him, Bert." And I figured, 
                         well, heck, I can't lose anything—so 
                         I yelled over to him "Good morning, 
                         Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding 
                         his fender, and was I burned! So I turned 
                         around to give my wife a dirty look 
                         and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't 
                         hear you." So, in a voice you could 
                         of heard in the next county, I yelled. 
                         "Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

                         Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over 
                         with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned 
                         around surprised like, and he put on 
                         a big smile, came over and took my hand 
                         like an old lodge brother, and he said. 
                         "Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting 
                         to talk to you for years, only I thought 
                         you didn't like me." And then he started 
                         chatting away like a happy little kid, 
                         and he got so excited his eyes begin 
                         waterin' up.

                         Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through, 
                         I found out Smithers is a swell egg, 
                         only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts 
                         for all the noises.

                         And he says it's a shame how little 
                         we know about our neighbors, and then 
                         he got an idea, and he said, "How's 
                         about inviting everybody some place 
                         where we can all get together and know 
                         each other a little better?" Well, I'm 
                         feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe 
                         for anything.

                         inviting everybody to a meeting at the

                         Uh-huh.
                                     
                         Med. shot: Of a group around SOURPUSS. 
                         He is as described, except when he smiles, 
                         his whole face warms up. Those around 
                         him push him forward. At first he looks 
                         bewildered, then, understanding, he 
                         starts toward BERT, grinning sheepishly.

                         This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, 
                         Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
                                      
                         SOURPUSS
                                     
                         Th—that's all right. If you didn't call 
                         me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.
 
                                                              
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         There are snickers from the background.
 
                                                              
                         BERT
                                     
                         Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody 
                         in the neighborhood came, except the 
                         DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big 
                         house with an iron fence around it and 
                         they always keep their blinds drawn, 
                         and we always figured that he was just 
                         an old miser that sat back counting 
                         his money, so why bother about inviting 
                         him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke 
                         up and he said, "Say, you've got the 
                         Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells
 
                                                              
                         ? 641 ?
                                     
                         us about how they cancelled their milk 
                         last week, and how, when he found a 
                         note in the bottle he got kinda curious 
                         like and he sorta peeked in under the 
                         blinds and found the house empty. "If 
                         you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
 
                                                              
                         SOURPUSS
                                     
                         Old man Delaney has been bringing his 
                         furniture over to my place at night, 
                         one piece at a time, and selling it.

                         BERT
                                     
                         Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen 
                         of us ran over there to fetch them and 
                         we got them to the meeting. What a reception 
                         they got. Why, everybody shook hands 
                         with them and made a fuss over them, 
                         and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney 
                         just sat right down and cried.
                                      
                         He smiles, embarrassed, and JOHN, as 
                         well as the others, clear their throats.

                         And then we started to find out about 
                         a lot of other people.
                                      
                         BERT
                                     
                         Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for 
                         instance.
                                      
                         BERT'S WIFE
                                     
                         Grubbel's here. See?
                                     
                         (pointing)
                                     
                         BERT
                                     
                         Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, 
                         you don't know Grubbel, but he's the 
                         man that everybody figured was the worst 
                         no-account in the neighborhood because 
                         he was living like a hermit and nobody'd 
                         have anything to do with him. Er, that 
                         is until Murphy, the postman told us 
                         the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, 
                         "he lives out of garbage cans because 
                         he won't take charity. Because it'd 
                         ruin his self-respect," he says.
                                      
                         BERT'S WIFE
                                     
                         Just like you said on the radio, Mr. 
                         Doe.
                                      
                         SOURPUSS
                                     
                         Well, sir, about a dozen families got 
                         together and gave Grubbel a job watering 
                         their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And 
                         then we found jobs for six other people 
                         and they've all gone off relief!

                         Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker 
                         made a job in his warehouse for old 
                         man Delaney—

                         And he gave you that five dollar raise.

                         that no politicians could join.

                         pans with them until they reach him.
 
                                                              
                         OLD LADY
                                     
                         I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and 
                         God bless you, my boy.
                                      
                         (she gently kisses his hand)
                                     
                         The two OLD PEOPLE leave.
                                     
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He swallows a lump 
                         in his throat. He watches the old people 
                         until they have left, then with a quick 
                         glance at his hand—and self-consciously 
                         in front of the others, stuffs his hand 
                         into his pocket.
                                      
                         Full shot: As they all watch him, without 
                         speaking. JOHN runs his hand through 
                         his hair, stealing a fleeting glance 
                         at the others, and grins awkwardly.

                         the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who have 
                         remained, to leave.
                                      
                         Med. shot: Of the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, 
                         who receive the signal and discreetly 
                         exit.
                                      
                         Full shot: They wait for JOHN to speak, 
                         but JOHN begins walking around, profoundly 
                         thoughtful.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL watching him, 
                         concerned.
                                      
                         Two shot: Of D. B. and ANN. Their eyes 
                         glued on him, expectantly.
                                      
                         Full shot: JOHN still paces, disturbed 
                         by clashing emotions. He stops, glances 
                         at the door, a soft, thoughtful expression 
                         in his eyes. Then, as his thought shifts, 
                         he runs his left hand over his pitching 
                         arm.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Gee, whiz—I'm all mixed up—I don't get 
                         it. Look, all those swell people think 
                         I'm gonna jump off a building or something.
 
                                                              
                         He looks toward the door.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         I never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella'd 
                         have to be a mighty fine example himself 
                         to go around telling other people how 
                         to—Say, look, what happened the other 
                         night was on account of Miss Mitchell, 
                         here. She wrote the stuff.
                                      
                         ANN walks over to JOHN.
                                     
                         Two shot: ANN and JOHN. She faces him, 
                         looking up into his face.

                         ANN
                                     
                         Don't you see what a wonderful thing 
                         this can be?
                                      
                         (softly)
                                     
                         But we need you , John.
                                     
                         Close-up: Of the COLONEL. He stares 
                         at JOHN, sees him weakening, and grimaces 
                         disgustedly.
                                      
                         Wider shot: The COLONEL watches JOHN 
                         as he continues to turn it over in his 
                         mind.
                                      
                         COLONEL
                                     
                         (suddenly)
                                     
                         You're hooked! I can see that right 
                         now.
                                      
                         They all look up, startled.
                                     
                         COLONEL
                                     
                         They got you. Well, I'm through.
                                     
                         (crosses to door—stops, turns)
                                     
                         For three years I've been trying to 
                         get you up to the Columbia River country. 
                         First, it was your glass arm. Then it 
                         was the radio. And now it's the John 
                         Doe clubs. Well, I ain't waiting another 
                         minute.
                                      
                         He opens the door and when he sees the 
                         townspeople still gathered outside, 
                         he yells to them.
                                      
                         COLONEL
                                     
                         Gangway, you heelots!
                                     
                         He pushes his way out.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (calling)
                                     
                         Hey, Colonel! Wait a minute!
                                     
                         He starts after the COLONEL, but when 
                         he gets to the door, the townspeople 
                         surge toward him and block his way.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Hey, Colonel!

                         (calling futilely)
                                     
                         Hey, Colonel!
                                     
                         He tries to peer over the heads of the 
                         townspeople who go on chattering. There 
                         is a trapped look on JOHN's face.

                         victorious glances:

                         Doe Clubs." There are a dozen pegs scattered 
                         over the map, indicating where the clubs 
                         are. We hear D. B.'s voice.
                                      
                         Camera draws back and we find D. B. 
                         talking to a group of men in front of 
                         him.

                         and the charters issued.

                         There are only eight flags up there 
                         now. I want to see that map covered 
                         before we get through!

                         which constantly remains a background 
                         for the montage following. As the montage 
                         proceeds, pegs begin to appear in abundance

                         I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this 
                         thing has been nothing short of a prairie 
                         fire. We've received so many applications 
                         for charters to the John Doe Clubs we 
                         haven't been able to take care of them.

                         I'd hate to have that many pins stuck 
                         in me!

                         This John Doe convention is a natural. 
                         It's gonna put our city on the map. 
                         Why, over twentyfour hundred John Doe 
                         clubs are sending delegates. Can you 
                         imagine that? You, Mr. Mayor, will be 
                         the official host. You will make the 
                         arrangements for decorating the city, 
                         parades and a reception for John Doe 
                         when he gets home! And—don't wear your 
                         high hat!

                         I want a special John Doe edition every 
                         day until the convention is over.

                         And now, if you will please just step 
                         into the outer office and look your 
                         prettiest because there are photographers 
                         there to take pictures of this committee.

                         way around. This John Doe movement costs 
                         you a fortune. This convention's gonna 
                         cost plenty.

                         (suddenly smiles)
                                     
                         Why, I'll have the satisfaction of knowing 
                         that my money has been spent for a worthy 
                         cause.

                         B. a moment. He realizes he has been 
                         told to mind his own business.

                         I see. I'd better stick to running the 
                         paper, huh?
                                      
                         D. B.
                                     
                         I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd 
                         like to have the John Doe contract, 
                         all the receipts for the money we have 
                         advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell 
                         wrote, for which I gave her a thousand 
                         dollars.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Yes. Sure.
                                     
                         CONNELL leaves.

                         Full shot: ANN's luggage is packed and 
                         ready to be taken out. She stands near 
                         a desk stuffing papers into a manuscript 
                         case. She seems lost in worried thought. 
                         The door opens as CHARLIE, high pressure 
                         exploitation man, enters.
                                      
                         CHARLIE
                                     
                         Well, we leave for the airport in half 
                         an hour. Is that Johnny-boy's room? 
                         I'd better hustle him up!

                         He'll be ready on time. He's packing 
                         now.
                                      
                         CHARLIE
                                     
                         Ah, good!
                                     
                         (crosses to Ann)
                                     
                         Did you see his picture on the cover 
                         of Time ?
                                      
                         ANN
                                     
                         Yeah.
                                     
                         CHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk 
                         in front of her. ANN glances at it, 
                         unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to 
                         a table where there are several bottles 
                         of coca-cola and starts to pour himself 
                         a drink.
                                      
                         CHARLIE
                                     
                         I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. 
                         I've handled a good many big promotions 
                         in my time . . . everything from the 
                         world's fair to a channel swimmer, but 
                         this one has certainly got me spinning. 
                         And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! 
                         Say! If you could only get him to jump 
                         off the City Hall roof on Christmas 
                         Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million 
                         people there.

                         ANN is lost in troubled thought.

                         What do you make of him?

                         Who, Johnny-boy?
                                     
                         ANN nods.
                                     
                         CHARLIE
                                     
                         Well, I don't know what angle you want, 
                         but I'll give it to you quick. Number 
                         one, he's got great yokel appeal; but 
                         he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning 
                         to believe he really wrote that original 
                         suicide letter that you made up. Number 
                         three, he thinks that you're Joan of 
                         Arc or something!
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. This is definitely 
                         troublesome to her.

                         Yeah, I know.
                                     
                         Wider shot: ANN walks away—pacing perturbedly.

                         Number four, well, you know what number 
                         four is. He's nuts about you. Yeah, 
                         it's running out of his ears.
                                      
                         ANN runs her hand through her hair. 
                         Suddenly she wheels around to CHARLIE.

                         You left out number five. We're all 
                         heels, me especially.
                                      
                         She returns to her packing. CHARLIE 
                         watches her a second.

                         They are interrupted by a knock on the 
                         door.

                         JOHN enters, carrying a suitcase.

                         Good. I'll go and get Beany-boy.

                         CHARLIE winks good-naturedly and exits. 
                         JOHN turns to ANN, who concentrates 
                         on her packing.

                         but does not turn.

                         Can I help you pack?
                                     
                         ANN
                                     
                         No, thank you.
                                     
                         JOHN wanders over to a chair and sits 
                         on the edge—watching her.

                         packing. Finally she turns.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He stares at her, 
                         a warm smile on his face.

                         No.
                                     
                         A broad smile appears on JOHN'S face.

                         You know, I had a crazy dream last night. 
                         It was about you.

                         About me?
                                     
                         JOHN

                         Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your 
                         father.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. The fact that he has 
                         seen himself in the image of her father 
                         disturbs her. She turns slowly.
                                      
                         Two shot: JOHN clears his throat nervously.

                         There was, there was something I was 
                         trying to stop you from doing. So, er, 
                         so I got up out of bed and I walked 
                         right through the wall here, right straight 
                         into your room.
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         You know how dreams are.
                                     
                         ANN stares at him—fearful of the trend 
                         his dream is taking.

                         JOHN
                                     
                         And there you were in bed.
                                     
                         (quickly apologizing)
                                     
                         But you—you were a little girl. You 
                         know—about ten.
                                      
                         He pauses and recalls the scene.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         And very pretty, too. So, I shook you, 
                         and the moment you opened your eyes, 
                         you hopped out of bed and started running 
                         like the devil, in your nightgown.
 
                                                              
                         You ran right out the window there. 
                         And you ran out over the tops of buildings 
                         and roofs and everything for miles, 
                         and I was chasing you.
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         And all the time you were running you 
                         kept growing bigger and bigger and bigger—and 
                         pretty soon you were as big as you are 
                         now. You know— grown up. And all the 
                         time I kept asking myself, "What am 
                         I chasing her for?" And I didn't know.
 
                                                              
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         Isn't that a hot one? Well, anyway, 
                         you ran into some place, and then Iran 
                         in after you and—and when I got there, 
                         there you were getting married.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He suddenly becomes 
                         aware he is treading on sensitive grounds.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN

                         And the nightgown had changed into a 
                         beautiful wedding gown. You sure looked 
                         pretty, too.

                         And then I knew what it was I was trying 
                         to stop you from doing.

                         feel uncomfortable—not quite knowing 
                         how to handle it.

                         was you were marrying?

                         No, not that bad. It was a fella that 
                         sends you flowers every day. Er, what's 
                         his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.

                         ANN turns back to her packing.

                         But here's the funniest part of it all. 
                         I was the fella up there doing the marrying. 
                         You know, the Justice of the Peace or 
                         something . . .

                         You were? I thought you were chasing 
                         me?
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, yes, I was. But I was your father 
                         then, see? But the real me, John Doe, 
                         er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I 
                         was the fellow up there with the book. 
                         You know what I mean?

                         I guess so. Then what happened?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, I took you across my knee and 
                         I started spanking you.
                                      
                         ANN turns and stares at him, eyes widening.

                         That is, I didn't do it.
                                     
                         (correcting himself)
                                     
                         I mean, I did do it, but it wasn't me. 
                         You see, I was your father then. Well, 
                         I laid you across my knee and I said: 
                         "Annie, I won't allow you to marry a 
                         man that's, that's just rich, or that 
                         has his secretary send you flowers. 
                         The man you marry has got to swim rivers 
                         for you! He's got to climb high mountains 
                         for you! He's got to slay dragons for 
                         you! He's got to perform wonderful deeds 
                         for you! Yes, sir!"
                                      
                         BEANY enters and stands back of him, 
                         listening.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         And all the time, er, the guy up there, 
                         you know, with the book, me, just stood 
                         there nodding his head and he said, 
                         "Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, 
                         because that's just the way I feel about 
                         it, too."
                                      
                         So he says, "Come on down here and whack 
                         her yourself." So I came down and I 
                         whacked you a good one, see? And then 
                         he whacked one—and I whacked you another 
                         one, and we both started whacking you 
                         like . . .

                         He demonstrates by slapping his knees, 
                         first with one hand and then with the 
                         other. Suddenly he becomes aware of 
                         BEANY and stops, embarrassed.

                         Well, if you're through whacking her, 
                         come on, let's get going.

                         Okay, fellows, right in here.

                         You go out the side entrance. There's 
                         a bunch of autograph seekers out front. 
                         We'll be down with the bags in a minute. 
                         Come on!

                         of this!
                                      
                         The bell boys have lifted her luggage 
                         and all exit.

                         Camera moves down counter to pick up 
                         JOHN and ANN at table. They sit silently 
                         for a moment. We hear the strains of 
                         music from a "juke" box.

                         How many people do you think we've talked 
                         to already, outside the radio, I mean?
 
                                                              
                         ANN
                                     
                         I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Three hundred thousand? What makes them 
                         do it, Ann? What makes them come and 
                         listen and, and get up their John Doe 
                         Clubs the way they do? I've been trying 
                         to figure it out.
                                      
                         ANN
                                     
                         (in an effort to disillusion him)
                                     
                         Look, John—what we're handing them are 
                         platitudes. Things they've heard a million 
                         times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds 
                         have silver linings," "Turn the other 
                         cheek." It's just a—

                         JOHN
                                     
                         (sincerely)
                                     
                         Yeah, I've heard them a million times, 
                         too, but—there you are. Maybe they're 
                         like me. Just beginning to get an idea 
                         what those things mean.
                                      
                         ANN is deeply concerned. She watches 
                         him, helplessly.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (continuing)
                                     
                         You know, I never thought much about 
                         people before. They were always just 
                         somebody to fill up the bleachers. The 
                         only time I worried about them was if 
                         they—is when they didn't come in to 
                         see me pitch. You know, lately I've 
                         been watching them while I talked to 
                         them. I could see something in their 
                         faces. I could feel that they were hungry 
                         for something. Do you know what I mean?
 
                                                              
                         ANN nods.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they 
                         were just lonely and wanted somebody 
                         to say hello to. I know how they feel. 
                         I've been lonely and hungry for something 
                         practically all my life.
                                      
                         ANN forces a smile. The moment threatens 
                         to become awkward—until they are saved 
                         by the pilot's voice.

                         They suddenly snap out of their mood—and 
                         as they rise:
                                      
                         Fade out.

                         Camera pans back to ANN. She glances

                         Wider shot: JOHN is still struggling 
                         to find conversation.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention 
                         later.
                                      
                         MRS. MITCHELL
                                     
                         Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets 
                         the flowers.
                                      
                         He rises and looks around for hat on 
                         the floor and back of the chair.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

                         (finds his hat and gives it to him)
 
                                                              
                         Good night, John.
                                     
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He starts away and 
                         suddenly stops, speculatively. He glances 
                         out of the corner of his eye toward 
                         MRS. MITCHELL.

                         (going back to her)
                                     
                         Say, Mrs. Mitchell, I, er, I'm kinda 
                         glad Ann isn't here. You see, I was, 
                         I came over here hoping to see her alone 
                         and kinda hoping I wouldn't, too. You 
                         know what I mean? There was something 
                         I wanted to talk to her about. But, 
                         well, I—It'll wait, I guess. Good night.

                         to sense what is on his mind, and her 
                         face becomes serious.

                         Starts toward door.

                         Say, look, Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever 
                         been married?

                         Oh, sure you have.

                         Gosh! That's pretty silly! I guess you 
                         must think I'm kinda batty!
                                      
                         JOHN shakes his head at his own stupidity.

                         Well, I guess I'd better be going at 
                         that!
                                      
                         He bows again, and starts for the door. 
                         When he gets there, he is stopped by

                         I married him.
                                     
                         JOHN comes right back to her.

                         Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It 
                         was easy as all that, huh?

                         JOHN
                                     
                         Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, 
                         you know I love Ann and it's gonna be 
                         awfully hard for me to say it because, 
                         well, you know, she's so wonderful, 
                         and, well, the best I ever was was a 
                         bush-league pitcher.

                         And you know, I think she's in love 
                         with another man, the one she made up. 
                         You know, the real John Doe. Well, that's 
                         pretty tough competition.

                         sympathetic.

                         I bet you he'd know how to say it all 
                         right. And me, I get up to it and around 
                         it and in back of it, but, but I never 
                         get right to it. Do you know what I 
                         mean? So the only chance I've got is, 
                         well, if somebody could kinda give her 
                         a warning sort of, sorta prepare her 
                         for the shock!

                         know, sort of break the ice.

                         touches her.

                         cheek and goes.

                         Not yet.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, look. No. Go ahead and have your 
                         dinner. I'll—
                                      
                         He is about to enter the car when a 
                         voice from off-scene stops him.

                         Wait a minute, John.
                                     
                         Camera pans over to a taxicab which 
                         has just driven in. CONNELL hands the 
                         driver a bill and walks, rather unsteadily 
                         toward JOHN.

                         Hello, Mr. Connell.
                                     
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Hiyah, John.
                                     
                         (broad wink)
                                     
                         John, I want to have a little talk with 
                         you.
                                      
                         (lurches—John holds him up)
                                     
                         What's the matter—are you falling? Come 
                         here.
                                      
                         Takes his arm to lead him off.
                                     
                         BEANY
                                     
                         (protesting)
                                     
                         Hey, Boss.
                                     
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.
                                     
                         (to John)
                                     
                         Say, tell me something did you read 
                         that speech you're gonna make tonight?
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         No, I never read the speeches before 
                         I make them. I get more of a kick out 
                         of it that way.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (wisely)
                                     
                         Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. 
                         Beany, go on down to the office, tell 
                         Pop to give you the speech. There's 
                         a copy on my desk.
                                      
                         BEANY
                                     
                         (protesting)
                                     
                         Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton 
                         told me not to leave him, not even for 
                         a minute.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (shooing him away)
                                     
                         Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at 
                         Jim's Bar up the street.
                                      
                         He points in the general direction and 
                         again takes JOHN's arm. JOHN watches 
                         him, rather amused to see CONNELL off 
                         his milk diet, and allows himself to 
                         be led away.

                         In a corner booth, JOHN and CONNELL 
                         sit, close together, drinks in front 
                         of them. JOHN's drink has remained untouched. 
                         CONNELL is just taking a long swig. 
                         From off-scene we hear the strains of 
                         an old-fashioned torch ballad, coming 
                         from an automatic piano.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         You're a nice guy, John. I like you. 
                         You're gentle. I like gentle people. 
                         Me? I'm hard—hard and tough.
                                      
                         (shakes his head—disparagingly)
                                     
                         I got no use for hard people. Gotta 
                         be gentle to suit me. Like you, for 
                         instance.

                         JOHN smiles, amused at him. CONNELL 
                         starts to light his cigarette, which 
                         is bent. He hold the match up, but it 
                         never reaches the tip of the bent cigarette. 
                         He puffs, satisfied.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Yep, I'm hard. But you want to know 
                         something? I've got a weakness. You'd 
                         never guess that, would you? Well, I 
                         have. Want to know what it is?
                                      
                         JOHN nods.

                         (looks directly at John)
                                     
                         Screwy, huh?
                                     
                         (turns back to his glass)
                                     
                         Well, maybe it is. But play the "Star 
                         Spangled Banner"—and I'm a sucker for 
                         it. It always gets me right here—

                         You know what I mean?

                         Yeah.

                         It gets me right back here.
                                     
                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL 
                         speculates about this with his head 
                         cocked.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Oh, back there, huh?
                                     
                         (shrugs, dismissing it)
                                     
                         Well, every man to his own taste.
                                     
                         JOHN smiles at him. CONNELL tries lighting 
                         his bent cigarette again—with the same 
                         result—while JOHN watches, amused.
 
                                                              
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         You weren't old enough for the first 
                         world war, were you?
                                      
                         JOHN starts to answer, but CONNELL goes 
                         right on.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Course not. Must have been a kid.
                                     
                         He pours JOHN's drink into his own glass.

                         Know what my old man did when I joined 
                         up? He joined up too.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He finds himself 
                         intensely interested.

                         That's a kick for you. We were in the 
                         same outfit. Funny, huh?

                         it.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (voice lowers)
                                     
                         He was killed, John.
                                     
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His face enveloped 
                         in an expression of sympathy.
                                      
                         Two shot: CONNELL stares down at the 
                         glass which he revolves between his 
                         palms.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         I saw him get it. I was right there 
                         and saw it with my own eyes.
                                      
                         Without glancing at JOHN, he lifts the 
                         glass and drains it.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (turns to JOHN)
                                     
                         Me? I came out of it without a scratch. 
                         Except for my ulcers. Should be drinking 
                         milk.
                                      
                         (picks up his glass)
                                     
                         This stuff's poison.
                                     
                         As he holds up his glass, he realizes 
                         it is empty.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (yelling to bartender)
                                     
                         Hey, Tubby!

                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (indicates the empty glass)
                                     
                         Whadda you say?

                         Close shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL 
                         looks around guardedly, to make certain 
                         he is not overhead.
                                      
                         CONNELL

                         Yessir. I'm a sucker for this country.
 
                                                              
                         (gets a little sore about it)
                                     
                         I'm a sucker for the Star Spangled Banner—and

                         (emphasizes each point)
                                     
                         A guy can say what he wants—and do what 
                         he wants—without having a bayonet shoved 
                         through his belly.
                                      
                         Med. shot: As he leans back and nods 
                         his head, satisfied he made his point.

                         Now, that's all right, isn't it?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         You betcha.
                                     
                         The BARTENDER comes in with drink and 
                         departs.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         All right. And we don't want anybody 
                         coming around changing it, do we?
 
                                                              
                         JOHN shakes his head.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         No, sir.
                                     
                         Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL.
                                     
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         No, sir. And when they do I get mad! 
                         I get b-boiling mad. And right now, 
                         John, I'm sizzling!
                                      
                         JOHN looks at him, puzzled.
                                     
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         I get mad for a lot of other guys besides 
                         myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! 
                         And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. 
                         Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a 
                         foggy world! You know what I mean?

                         Yeah, you bet!
                                     
                         CONNELL takes a drink and looks at JOHN 
                         a moment before he speaks.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         (leans on the table)
                                     
                         Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's 
                         pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Yeah. It certainly is.
                                     
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         And you'd feel like an awful sucker 
                         if you found yourself marching right 
                         in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
 
                                                              
                         JOHN glances up sharply.

                         And you, of course you wouldn't know 
                         it because you're gentle. But that's 
                         what you're doing. You're mixed up with 
                         a skunk, my boy, a no-good, dangerous 
                         skunk!
                                      
                         JOHN'S resentment vanishes—and is replaced 
                         by puzzlement.

                         Say, you're not talking about Mr. Norton, 
                         are you?

                         I'm not talking about his grandfather's 
                         pet poodle!
                                      
                         CONNELL again makes an effort to light 
                         his bent cigarette—and again is unsuccessful.

                         You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause 
                         he's been marvelous about the John Doe 
                         Clubs.

                         Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, 
                         aren't you?

                         It's a beautiful miracle. A miracle 
                         that could only happen right here in 
                         the good old U.S.A. And I think it's 
                         terrific! What do you think of that! 
                         Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's 
                         plenty terrific!

                         All right! Now, supposing a certain 
                         unmentionable worm, whose initials are 
                         D. B., was trying to use that to shove 
                         his way into the White House. So he 
                         could put the screws on, so he could 
                         turn out the lights in those lighthouses. 
                         What would you say about that? Huh?

                         Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. 
                         They can't use the John Doe Clubs for 
                         politics. That's the main idea.

                         Is that so? Then what's a big political 
                         boss like Hammett doing in town? And 
                         a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot 
                         of other big shots who are up at D. 
                         B.'s house right now? Wolves, John,

                         those speeches and nobody can make her 
                         write that kind of stuff.

                         grabs the startled CONNELL violently 
                         by his shirt front, lifting him out

                         Yeah, well it's about time.

                         Even a conservative estimate shows that 
                         we can count on anywhere between ten 
                         and twenty million John Doe votes. Now, 
                         add to that the labor vote that Mr. 
                         Bennett will throw in . . .

                         Hammett and the rest of you gentlemen 
                         in your territories—

                         She apparently has been listening to 
                         things that have caused her considerable 
                         anxiety.

                         you can guarantee the John Doe vote.

                         Don't worry about that.

                         You can count on me under one condition.

                         this room would be taken care? My agreement 
                         with you gentlemen stands!

                         it's a very daring thing we're attempting!

                         These are daring times, Mr. Barrington. 
                         We're coming to a new order of things. 
                         There's been too much talk going on 
                         in this country.

                         iron hand!

                         That's true. You're quite right, D.

                         There are cries of: "Hear, hear!" and 
                         applause.

                         Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold 
                         on! That's rather big talk! I started 
                         the John Doe clubs with my money and 
                         I'll decide whether or not they're being 
                         properly used!
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         No you won't! You're through deciding 
                         anything!
                                      
                         D. B. cannot believe his ears.

                         And what's more, I'm going down to that 
                         convention and I'm gonna tell those 
                         people exactly what you and all your 
                         fine-feathered friends here are trying 
                         to cook up for them!
                                      
                         He looks up at ANN—and starts tearing 
                         the speech in his hand.

                         And I'll say it in my own words this 
                         time.
                                      
                         He flings the torn paper toward ANN—and 
                         starts out.

                         Wait a minute, young feller—my uncle 
                         wants to talk to you.
                                      
                         D. B. walks up to JOHN.
                                     
                         D. B.
                                     
                         Listen to me, my son! Before you lose 
                         your head completely, may I remind you 
                         that I picked you up out of the gutter 
                         and I can throw you right back there 
                         again! You've got a nerve accusing people 
                         of things! These gentlemen and I know 
                         what's the best for the John Does of 
                         America, regardless of what tramps like 
                         you think!
                                      
                         Get off that righteous horse of yours 
                         and come to your senses. You're the 
                         fake! We believe in what we're doing! 
                         You're the one that was paid the thirty 
                         pieces of silver! Have you forgotten 
                         that? Well, I haven't!
                                      
                         You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove 
                         it! You're the big hero that's supposed 
                         to jump off tall buildings and things! 
                         Do you remember? What do you suppose 
                         your precious John Does will say when 
                         they find out that you never had any 
                         intention of doing it? That you were 
                         being paid to say so? You're lucky if 
                         they don't run you out of the country!
 
                                                              
                         Why, with the newspapers and the radio 
                         stations that these gentlemen control, 
                         we can kill the John Doe movement deader 
                         than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, 
                         the moment you step out of line! Now, 
                         if you still want to go to that convention 
                         and shoot your trap off, you go ahead 
                         and do it!

                         Do you mean to tell me you'd try to 
                         kill the John Doe movement if you can't 
                         use it to get what you want?

                         idea that's made millions of people 
                         a little bit happier! An idea that's 
                         brought thousands of them here from 
                         all over the country, by bus and by 
                         freight, in jallopies and on foot—so 
                         they could pass on to each other their 
                         own simple little experiences.

                         Why, look, I'm just a mug and I know 
                         it. But I'm beginning to understand 
                         a lot of things. Why, your type's old 
                         as history. If you can't lay your dirty 
                         fingers on a decent idea and twist it 
                         and squeeze it and stuff it into your 
                         own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, 
                         if you can't eat something, you bury 
                         it!

                         Why, this is the one worthwhile thing 
                         that's come along. People are finally 
                         finding out that the guy next door isn't 
                         a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? 
                         And yet a thing like that's got a chance 
                         of spreading till it touches every last 
                         doggone human being in the world—and 
                         you talk about killing it!
                                      
                         Full shot: They listen to him—unmoved.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Why, when this fire dies down, what's 
                         going to be left? More misery, more 
                         hunger and more hate. And what's to 
                         prevent that from starting all over 
                         again? Nobody knows the answer to that 
                         one, and certainly not you, with those 
                         slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! 
                         The John Doe idea may be the answer, 
                         though! It may be the one thing capable 
                         of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you 
                         sit back there on your fat hulks and 
                         tell me you'll kill it if you can't 
                         use it!

                         do it in a million years, with all your 
                         radio stations and all your power! Because 
                         it's bigger than whether I'm a fake! 
                         It's bigger than your ambitions! And 
                         it's bigger than all the bracelets and 
                         fur coats in the world!

                         with a suddenness that startles TED, 
                         he steps aside and clips TED on the 
                         jaw. TED's knees buckle and he goes 
                         down. JOHN exits.

                         Listen, ladies and gentlemen!
                                     
                         Before he can go any further, the band 
                         strikes up the strain of "AMERICA" and 
                         immediately the large assembly begins 
                         singing it.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. As his lips form 
                         the words. His expression is solemn.

                         Long shot: As people sing. Finally the 
                         song is ended, and an enthusiastic cheer 
                         is emitted by the crowd.
                                      
                         Med. shot: On platform. JOHN again steps 
                         toward the microphone and makes another 
                         effort to speak, but the CLERGYMAN places 
                         a detaining hand on his arm.
                                      
                         CLERGYMAN
                                     
                         Just a moment, John. We begin with a 
                         short prayer.

                         of the audience toward the platform 
                         in the background. Gradually the cheering 
                         subsides.
                                      
                         CLERGYMAN

                         Quiet, please. Ladies and gentlemen—let 
                         us have a moment of silent prayer for 
                         the John Does all over the world . . 
                         . many of whom are homeless and hungry. 
                         Rise, please. Everybody rise.
                                      
                         The CLERGYMAN and JOHN, standing next 
                         to him, immediately bow their heads.

                         As far as the Camera eye can see, heads 
                         are bowed in prayer. The reflection 
                         on the wet umbrellas creates a strange 
                         and mystic light.

                         face wreathed in an expression of compassion.

                         bow respectfully. The reporters are 
                         quiet for the first time.

                         newsboys—they immediately alight.

                         toward us yelling:

                         and down every aisle, boys are running, 
                         waving papers in the air.

                         waving in the air.

                         Camera pans with him as he hurries down 
                         the aisle to the platform—all eyes turned 
                         toward him.

                         B. approaching, too flustered to know 
                         what to do.

                         runs up the few steps and proceeds to 
                         the microphone, troopers clearing the 
                         way for him.

                         Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all 
                         know me! I accuse this man of being 
                         a faker! We've been taken for a lot 
                         of suckers! And I'm the biggest of the 
                         lot!

                         I spent a fortune backing this man in 
                         what I believed to be a sincere and 
                         worthy cause, just as you all did! And 
                         now I find out it's nothing but a cheap 
                         racket! Cooked up by him and two of 
                         my employees for the sole purpose of 
                         collecting dues from John Does all over 
                         the country!
                                      
                         JOHN breaks away from the troopers and 
                         gets to the mike.

                         That's a lie!

                         It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To 
                         stuff into their own pockets! You can 
                         read all about it in the newspapers 
                         there!
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what 
                         he says . . .

                         Let go of me! This man had no intention 
                         of jumping off of the top of a building! 
                         He was paid to say so!

                         Do you deny that?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         That's got nothing to do with it!
                                     
                         D. B.
                                     
                         Were you paid for it—or weren't you?

                         Yes! I was paid! But the—
                                     
                         D. B.

                         And what about the suicide note? You 
                         didn't write that, either!
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         What difference does that make?
                                     
                         D. B.
                                     
                         Did you write it—or didn't you?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         No, I didn't write it, but—
                                     
                         D. B.
                                     
                         Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You 
                         look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, 
                         and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed 
                         confession that she was the one that 
                         wrote it!
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't 
                         write the letter, but this whole thing 
                         started—

                         D. B.
                                     
                         There! You see? He admits it! You're 
                         a fake, John Doe! And for what you've 
                         done to all these good people—they ought 
                         to run you out of the country—and I 
                         hope they do it!
                                      
                         He leaves the platform—followed by his 
                         troopers.
                                      
                         Several shots: Of groups as they stare 
                         at JOHN, silent and stunned, waiting 
                         for him to speak.
                                      
                         Full shot: The whole park full of people 
                         wait in breathless anticipation. From 
                         somewhere in the distance we hear a 
                         single voice of a man.

                         several of D. B.'s troopers pulling 
                         at the cables of the public address 
                         system.

                         Please listen, folks! Now that he's 
                         through shooting off his face, I've 
                         got a couple of things to tell you about—

                         of the troopers disconnects the public 
                         address system by cutting the cable.
 
                                                              
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He realizes the loud 
                         speaker is dead, and looks around helplessly.

                         the head of one of SHELDON's troopers 
                         appear—and cupping his hands over his 
                         mouth, he yells toward platform.

                         No sense in going up there! I been here 
                         for hours. He ain't here!

                         Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
 
                                                              
                         But ANN vanishes. The COLONEL shakes 
                         his head and resumes his post.

                         others, enters. Camera pans with them 
                         as they go toward the elevator.

                         The MAYOR takes out his keys and unlocks 
                         the elevator door.

                         them, puzzled. Can't figure out what 
                         they are doing here.

                         door, which opens and the men come out.

                         This is as far as the elevator goes. 
                         We've got to walk up to the tower.

                         searchingly—and then slowly move toward 
                         the edge of the parapet.
                                      
                         Closer shot: The men look obviously 
                         self-conscious. No one speaks for a 
                         while.

                         That tramp is probably full of Christmas 
                         cheer and asleep in some flop house.
 
                                                              
                         There is again silence. After a few 
                         minutes, the MAYOR speaks.
                                      
                         MAYOR
                                     
                         Let's go. I've got to decorate my tree.

                         out, and as camera pans with him he 
                         proceeds to letter chute next to elevator. 
                         We see that it is the top of the chute, 
                         and from the elevator being there, we 
                         know it is the 14th floor. JOHN drops 
                         the letter into the chute.

                         place is silent except for occasional 
                         scraping of feet as several of the men 
                         move around. They continually refer 
                         to their watches. Finally, D. B. gives 
                         up impatiently.

                         Well, I give up. I don't know what gave 
                         us the idea that he—he'd attempt anything 
                         like this.

                         I guess you're right. I'm afraid the 
                         joke's on us. Let's go.

                         They all start to exit, when suddenly 
                         D. B. stops. He puts his hand out, and 
                         they all stop to listen. They hear footsteps, 
                         and back into the shadows.

                         their eyes dominate the scene.

                         JOHN, expressionless, his cigarette 
                         in his hand, crosses to the parapet, 
                         and looks out. He takes a puff of his 
                         cigarette and exhales the smoke.

                         MAYOR is for stepping forward, but D. 
                         B. with an extended hand stops him, 
                         indicating for them to wait and see 
                         what happens.

                         Their eyes riveted on JOHN. They feel 
                         the moment has come. Several of them 
                         glance toward D. B.

                         ground, and bending over, crushes it 
                         with his foot. Just as he straightens 
                         out again, D. B. speaks.

                         I wouldn't do that if I were you, John.
 
                                                              
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. As he turns sharply, 
                         startled. He stares blankly at the five 
                         people.

                         I've taken care of that. I've already 
                         mailed a copy of this letter to Mr. 
                         Connell.

                         he thought of this. They feel themselves 
                         helpless. D. B. tries taking an authoritative 
                         tone.

                         me.

                         a wild, maniacal look in them.

                         I'm glad you gentlemen are here. You've 
                         killed the John Doe movement, all right, 
                         but you're going to see it born all 
                         over again. Now, take a good look, Mr. 
                         Norton.

                         ANN practically has to pull herself 
                         up to the last step. Her face is wet 
                         from fever and exhaustion.

                         down at her, blankly. ANN clutches him, 
                         her head buried in his shoulder.

                         wracking sobs, then lifts her eyes up 
                         to him.

                         start all over again, just you and I. 
                         It isn't too late. The John Doe movement 
                         isn't dead yet.
                                      
                         Suddenly she becomes conscious of the 
                         others present, and she turns her head.
 
                                                              
                         Camera pans over to what she sees. The 
                         group of men watching, silently.
                                      
                         Camera pans back to ANN. Her eyes widen 
                         slowly. She looks from them to JOHN 
                         and back again, and her face takes on 
                         an excited, breathless look, as the 
                         reason for their being there becomes 
                         comprehensible to her.

                         See, John! It isn't dead, or they wouldn't 
                         be here! It's alive in them . They kept 
                         it alive. By being afraid of it. That's 
                         why they came up here.

                         to stand with his hands at his sides, 
                         looking at her, while she clings to 
                         him desperately. While she speaks, he 
                         turns his face from her and stares at 
                         the men.

                         Oh, darling. Sure, it should have been 
                         killed before. It was dishonest.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He is staring strangely 
                         at the group of men—as slowly, gradually, 
                         the curtain is being lifted from his 
                         clouded brain.

                         and I. It'll grow again, John. It'll 
                         grow big. And it'll be strong, because 
                         it'll be honest!
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her strength is fast 
                         ebbing away. She clings to JOHN more 
                         tenaciously.

                         to her. Her eyes light up with a wide, 
                         ecstatic fire.

                         to keep the John Doe idea alive! Someone

                         No, John, if you die, I want to die, 
                         too!

                         Her strength leaves her—and as her eyelids 
                         slowly shut, she collapses limply in 
                         his arms.

                         bewildered, at ANN at his feet. Mechanically, 
                         he reaches down and lifts her in his 
                         arms.

                         JOHN vaguely becomes aware of BERT's 
                         presence and glances toward him.

                         Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and 
                         acted like a mob. Why, we . . .

                         What Bert's trying to say is—well—we 
                         need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot 
                         of us didn't believe what that man said.

                         were going to do the same thing. Why, 
                         Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter from

                         in his eyes has vanished. It is now 
                         replaced by an expression of softness 
                         and understanding.

                         JOHN remains standing, thoughtful.

                         at D. B. and his crowd. Then, turning 
                         back to BERT, his eyes light up and 
                         something of a warm smile appears on 
                         his face.

                         and lick that! Come on, Colonel.
                                      
                         They exit, arm in arm, as the music 
                         swells—suggesting emergence from darkness 
                         and confusion to light and understanding.
 
                                                              
                         Fade out.
