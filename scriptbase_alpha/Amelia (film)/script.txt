              EXT. BAR, LAE, NEW GUINEA - DAY

              CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN.
              A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the-
              art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting.
              PULL BACK to see...

              ...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-
              sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And
              peering down through the mist and rain...

              ...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane.
              Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray
              eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her.
              Something fierce lives there.

                        Sure I can't talk you inta
                        somethin' more adventurous?
              She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome
              in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt-
              streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a
              Coke which he sets down for her.

                                   AMELIA
                        Adventurous? You've got the wrong
                        girl, Mister. You should know that
                        by now.
              Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself
              four fingers.

                                  FRED
                        Actually. I knew that the moment I
                        met ol' George.
              He sips his drink.    She says nothing.

                                  FRED (CONT'D)
                        I like how you don't talk about
                        him.

                                   AMELIA
                        That why I get so many chances to
                        not do it?

                                   FRED
                        Well.   Natural curiosity.
              His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila.
              She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her
              side of the table.

                                                                        2.

          

          

          

                                  FRED
                        I mean, why would a guy who needs
                        to run the show. Pick the one girl
                        he knew could kick his tail?

              No response.   Just her clear direct gaze.

                                  FRED (CONT'D)
                        I'll bet he knew that. First time
                        he met you.

              She looks out to sea.

                                 AMELIA
                        He thought I hated him.      He never
                        knew I was fascinated.

              Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully
              built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once
              strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now,
              there are none to be seen. Even as...
              ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits
              respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad.
              Does he know she's there?

              SUPERIMPOSE:   NEW YORK, LATER 1937.

                                  GEORGE
                            (without turning)
                        The first time I met her she sat
                        in that chair.
              The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And
              still with his back to her...

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You may as well write it down,
                        Mary. Write it all down. Even the
                        parts that are confused or
                        graceless or boring.
              He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        We'll see if I remember how to
                        edit.
              She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of
              being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...

          

                                                                           3.

          

          

          

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        I'd kept her waiting two hours.

                        T
                        She hated me on sight, but she
                          hought I couldn't tell.
              His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one
              object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a
              green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        She was a person who cherished her
                        privacy and was devoting her life
                        to social work. And there I was...
              His smile is kind.   And honestly self-mocking.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the
                        glory of my authors and celebrity
                        acquaintances. A vain, fast-
                        talking, manipulator. But then I
                        guess you know all that, don't you?
              She looks up reproachfully.   Nothing of the kind, and you
              know it.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, yes. And the kind of man who
                        fishes for compliments.
              He's made her laugh.

              She is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the
              center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come
              and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring
              through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an
              exam.

                        The waiting made her furious.
                        She undoubtedly felt I was

                          stablishing my dominance and

                              GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Actually, I hadn't given her a
                    thought. Oblivious as usual.
                    Which, perhaps, was even worse.
          Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer
          preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd
          with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.

                              AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I figured he'd be pompous.
          Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers,
          explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of
          George with the great Lindbergh.
          A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises,
          smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down
          the corridor.

                              AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I knew, of course, that he wasn't
                    going to choose me. I had no
                    discernible qualifications
                    whatsoever.
          They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER
          PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly
          pushes it open...
          ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and
          suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him,
          negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of
          messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric,
          masterful.

                              AMELIA (V.O)
                    But to be rejected by this...
                    parasite. A man who had given up
                    any life of his own to flutter near
                    the famous.
          He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is
          there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.

                              AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know whether to laugh or
                    throw something at the jerk.
          He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't
          move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze
          from him. He hangs up the phone.
          They stare at each other for a frozen beat.   He breaks the
          moment with a charming smile...

          

                                                                5.

                                 GEORGE (softly)
                       I asked you to sit.

                                 AMELIA
                       Was that the thing you did with
                       your hand? Sadly, I don't speak
                       dog.
          His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine.

                                  GEORGE
          A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like.
           melia sits.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                       I'm told you want to fly the
                       Atlantic Ocean.

                                   AMELIA
                       I do.

                                 GEORGE
                       In the 12 months since Lindbergh,
                       55 people in 18 planes have tried.
                       Three planes made it. Fourteen
                       people have died.

                                 AMELIA
                       I'll make it.

                                 GEORGE
                       Three women died trying. Two
                       others escaped with their lives.
                       If you do make it, you'd be the
                       first. Which...is the real
                       attraction for both of us, I
                       suspect.
          She nods.    No smile.

                                 AMELIA
                       Always nice to know what the real
                       attraction is.
          His smile.    Beginning to enjoy this conversation.

                              GEORGE
                    The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd
                    by Amy Guest, a socialite who
                    wanted the record for herself. Her
                    family wouldn't tolerate the
                    danger. She has asked for a
                    replacement...
          He gestures.   Perhaps you.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    ...who is American, educated, well-
                    spoken, a flyer, preferably
                    physically attractive...

                              AMELIA
                    Why would that matter?

                              GEORGE
                    Because she wants the world to pay
                    attention. And pretty girls
                    command more attention.

                              AMELIA
                    Was that your advice?

                              GEORGE
                    Sure. My role is selling this
                    event to the public. There will be
                    a contract for the girl's story
                    with the New York Times. Also a
                    book to be published over her name.

                    go to Mrs. Guest.

                    Except for the part that goes to
                    you.

                              GEORGE
                    Which will be as great as I can
                    manage, I assure you.

                    You said she wants a flyer.

                              GEORGE
                    Don't get your hopes up. The
                    celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be
                    the pilot. There'll be a male co-
                    pilot and navigator. The woman
                    will be purely a passenger.

          

                                                                     7.

          

          

          
          He waits for reaction.   She keeps her mouth shut.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    That's good for your chances.
                    Because your level of flying
                    experience wouldn't place you
                    anywhere near the group that would
                    be considered for this. If the
                    woman were to do any flying at all.
          No punches pulled.   Not his style.

                               AMELIA
                    Why would anyone want a book from a
                    passenger?

                              GEORGE
                    Because the hook is that we're
                    making the woman the commander.
                    The pilot will sign a contract
                    saying he is under her direction
                    and control. It's her ship, her
                    flight.

                              AMELIA
                    Good for my chances, you said.
                    What are my chan...

                              GEORGE
                    The job's yours.
          She blinks.   Stunned speechless.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    I chose you the moment you walked
                    through the door.
          He smiles his charming smile.    Several phones are RINGING.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Now assuming my awful manners
                    haven't soured you on the
                    enterprise. May I give you a lift
                    to the station?
          Amelia rises.   Is she pissed at being toyed with?

                              AMELIA
                    You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I
                    can find my way.
          The look holds.   He shrugs.   You probably can.

          

                                                                        8.

              Two figures on the platform.   Her train is ready to leave.

                                  GEORGE
                        I honestly feel an apology is in
                        order.

                                   AMELIA
                        Fine.   What have I done?
              She watches his smile.

                                  AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        I didn't mind waiting. Caught up
                        on my reading. Knitted a sweater.

                                  GEORGE
                        I mean an apology.   For what's
                        coming.
              His voice softens.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to be pretty controlling
                        these next few months. How you
                        dress, move, cut your hair. Speak
                        in public. It's all part of the
                        package we're selling.

                                   AMELIA
                        We.

                                  GEORGE
                        That's right. If you're not in
                        there selling with me, it won't
                        work.
              The smile turns friendly.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You're the star. I'm no one at
                        all.

                                  AMELIA
                        Spoken like a gentleman.
              She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man.
              He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches
              his cheery wave as she rolls away.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Of course a gentleman. Would have
                        paid for my ticket.

              Two LITTLE GIRLS, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field.
              Amelia and a girlfriend. They stop, hearing...
              The DRONING of an engine, a small red plane APPEARING above
              the treetops. The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field,
              SWOOPS down to BUZZ them. Amelia's friend runs for her life.
              But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the
              plane...
              ...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the
              slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER,
              as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The
              aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                        As the little red airplane passed
                        by, it said something to me.
              Amelia beams.   She fills her lungs, transported.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don't think I've ever stopped
                        listening.

              Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane
              HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes.

               On the periphery, ADULTS sit, taking in the story. They are

                    Don't joke about that.
          She wasn't joking at all.

                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You'll make it. And then you'll
                    have opportunities to work in
                    aviation. Anywhere you want.
          She laughs.

                              AMELIA
                    Well, I'll have impressive
                    credentials as a long-distance
                    passenger. That's not exactly a
                    career in aviation.
          She looks up at his eyes.

                    I         AMELIA (CONT'D)
                     'm not going anywhere, social work
                    is my life. After all the years of
                    false starts, I found the thing I'm
                    meant to do.
          Keep walking.   She gives him time to say...

                              SAM
                    And where does that leave us?

                         You do love to look on the dark
                         side. Whatever did you see in a
                         sunny character like me?
               She gives him a sweet playful smile.   It doesn't reassure
               him.

                                   SAM
                         It's not as if I'd been putting
                         pressure on you.

                                   AMELIA
                         What love means to you. What it
                         requires. Is the pressure.
               He stops walking.

                                   SAM
                         I love you. Is that such a
                         terrible problem?
               She gazes at him.   Can he even hear this?

                                   AMELIA
                         The problem is what it's always
                         been. The problem is me.

                         The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll,
                         about to become the first female to
                         fly the Atlantic in the wake of
                         Lindbergh's historic journey,
                         regales an eager world press...
               The sound switches to Mabel at the mikes...

                         Okay, boys. I'll take any

               INT. HANGAR, EAST BOSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT

                he heavy door rolls OPEN. George and Amelia enter the
               brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the FRIENDSHIP,
               a sea-plane with golden wings. Its red-orange fuselage
               stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The
               pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to
               the plane.
               They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with
               quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures
               and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not
               necessarily happy to see us.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.)
                         George had told me Stultz was Adm.
                         Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless,
                         gifted. He drank. But George said
                         it never affected his work.
               George waves as we approach.   Bill and Amelia seem locked on
               each other.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         When he said it, I must have had a
                         funny look. So I just said, `Yeh,
                         I grew up around a guy like that.'

                                   GEORGE
                         Boys, I'd like to introduce your
                         commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.

                                   AMELIA
                         We felt `commander' was less
                         grandiose than, say, `empress.'
               Bill doesn't smile.   The other man does...

                                    GEORGE
                         Say hello to Slim Gordon your
                         navigator.
               She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         And Bill Stultz here, simply the
                         most talented pilot working.
               She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm,
               yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for
               their relationship.

          

                                                                   15.

          

          

          

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got
                    his plane...

                              AMELIA

                    Y
                     ou mean the Admiral flies on
                    those?
          The pontoons.   She does not seem admiring.

                              GEORGE
                    Nope, those are new, personally
                    suggested by the old man himself.
          Bill nods on that.   Sure were.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    This way, if you're forced down
                    at sea, you can wait for a rescue.

                               AMELIA
                    Hmmn.   What does that do to our
                    fuel?

                              BILL
                    Costs us at least 400 gallons.
                    Don't bother bringing clothes for
                    Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the
                    nearest beach in Ireland. Real
                    lucky.

                              GEORGE
                    The Admiral estimates the pontoons
                    only cut our range by 200 miles.
          But Amelia looks to Bill.   That's not really possible is it?

                              BILL
                    The Admiral is the Admiral. He
                    gets to estimate any damn thing he
                    wants. All we have to do is figure
                    out how to fly without petrol.
          She turns to George with challenging eyes.

                              BILL (CONT'D)
                    Don't go blaming the bookseller.
                    He's been all through this with
                    Mrs. Guest, but she worships the
                    Admiral. And it's money that puts
                    planes in the air.

                              AMELIA
                    I wonder if it can keep them up
                    there. Not that I've ever had
                    enough to try.

          

                                                                        16.

          

          

          
               Bill's small smile.   Maybe the girl's all right.

               EXT. DOCK - LATER

               George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights
               of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down.
               She's watching his profile.

                                     AMELIA
                         Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth
                         shut.

                                   GEORGE
                         What I ought to try. Is listening
                         to you once in awhile.

               H
                e meant that.   And she seems oddly touched.

                                     AMELIA
                         Careful.    I could get to like it.
               No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds
               out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help
               to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her
               decide. And then...
               She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for
                         everything.

                                   GEORGE
                             (a smile)
                         Simpkin.

                                   AMELIA
                         It's in a book. Oh, that's right.
                         You read the ones you publish.
               Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in
               the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.

                         There's a Beatrix Potter story
                         about a cat named Simpkin.
               PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They
               are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston.

                    He wasn't happy unless he had
                    several mice, each under a
                    different teacup. So he could
                    never become bored.
          We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo
          of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is
          labeled `LUCKY LINDY.'

                              AMELIA (V.O.)
                    THe illusion of activity was
                    essential for him to feel at peace.
          The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh
          in a different pose.

                              AMELIA
                    What are you boys doing over there?

                              GEORGE
                    Trying to make you look like a
                    girl.
          George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins
          moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to
          Lindbergh's angle.

                                  MELIA (V.O.)
                    I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's
                    43rd mouse?     Or his 307th.
          Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her
          hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...

                               G

                               EORGE
                     he more we can make you look
                    like a girl, the better.

                              AMELIA
                    Oh god, is it worth the effort?
          He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not.

                              GEORGE
                    Wondering who should play you
                    in the film of all this. I'm
                    thinking Chaplin.

                              AMELIA
                    Valentino's not available?
          He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more.
          This time, his hands linger.

          

                                                                         18.

                         Two things. One, Chaplin can't
                         play me because he's perfect for
                         you. And two, you have company.
               She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is
               being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her.
               He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her
               tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them
               both.

                                   GEORGE
                         Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy
                         Binney Putnam.
               The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye
               contact.

                                   DOROTHY
                         Great to meet you. George talks
                         so much about you.
                             (a wink)
                         In fact, lately, you're all he
                         does talk about.

          
               George steps in close, and the photographer SNAPS a three-
               shot. And another.

                                   PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Hold those smiles for one more,
                         please.

          

          

               EXT. JEFFREY YACHT CLUB HARBOR, EAST BOSTON - EARLY LIGHT 15


          15
               The FRIENDSHIP bobbing on its pontoons. Bill and Slim are
               off-loading equipment and other gear from the plane to a
               TUGBOAT filled with support crew and family. The plane's
               engines REV in the predawn stillness. PULL BACK to see...

               EXT. YACHT CLUB DOCK - EARLY LIGHT


           6                                                                16
               ...the yacht club dock. George and Amelia alone at the
               railing. She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots.
               They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward. From her
               bag now, she pulls three ENVELOPES...
               Puts them in George's hand.   Straight, unblinking...

                                   AMELIA
                         Popping off letters. For my dad,
                         my mom, my sis. You know. In
                         case.

          

                                                                   19.

          

          

          
          He stares down. Rocked by the weight of this against the
          simplicity of her words. The top envelope says: DEAREST

          DAD.

                               GEORGE
                     I'm honored. That you'd leave
                     these with me.

                               AMELIA
                     Who else? If I do pop off, it's
                     your fault.
          Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding.    It takes a
          beat before he can offer...

                               GEORGE
                     I'll call them once you're safely
                     on your way.

                               AMELIA
                     Sam will handle that.   They trust
                     him.
          That registers.

                               GEORGE
                     I've figured out the Simpkin thing,
                     you know.

                                 AMELIA
                     Have you.

                               GEORGE
                     Sure. There are so few books I
                     haven't published, it was easy
                     to find.
          Well...?

                               GEORGE (CONT'D)
                     Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of
                     Gloucester. He's a cat in a
                     green frock coat.

                               AMELIA
                     But why is he you?
          Oh.

                               GEORGE
                     He's brilliant, charismatic...

                               AMELIA
                     So you haven't actually read it.
                     Do you actually read?

                            manipulative. Am I getting warmer?
               She sighs.

                            off with me.
               A held look.     A friendly...

                                       AMELIA (CONT'D)
                            Well.   See ya.
               She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship.
                e stands watching her go.

               INT. SMALL HOTEL, NEWFOUNDLAND - MORNING

               Amelia alone, leaving her hotel room in her flight jacket.
               Locking the door.

               SUPERIMPOSE:     FIRST STOP: CANADA

                                      AMELIA (V.O.)
                            Our first hop was to Canada, to
                            start from as close as we could get
                            to Ireland. Just in case we
                            couldn't get the thing in the air
                            and had to row.
               She walks briskly down the corridor.

                                      AMELIA (V.O.)
                            The fuel was going to be so close,
                            every single mile counted.
               Turns a corner.      Approaches the dining room door.

                                      AMELIA (V.O.)
                            George told me to keep to my room,
                            just in case there was a reporter
                            or two somewhere.
               She enters the hotel dining room. Stops cold. Across the
               room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from
               their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and
               PHOTOGRAPHERS. Holy shit. Half a dozen CAMERAS RISE as one.
               It is a defining moment. And Amelia...
               Cocks her head.      Throws an effortless golden smile.

                                   AMELIA
                         Hi there, boys. How are the ham
                         and eggs?
               The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia
               makes her way to them.

                                   BILL
                         Don't blame us, lady. I think
                         somebody's starting to sell books.
               The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The
               New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR

               ATLANTIC HOP.
               There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched
               being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to
               it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker.

               A
                melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and
               shaking her head.

                                    EPORTER
                         Say, Amelia. What have you got for
                         Mabel Boll to chew on?

                                   AMELIA
                         Now why would a famous gal like
                         Mabel give a thought to someone
                         like me? I don't have a single
                         sweater made out of gold.
               The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a
               smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US!

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         Hey, not even silver.
               The boys make room.   Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.    A
               friendly murmur...

                                   BILL
                         The ham's a little tough,
                         Commander. But the bacon's swell.

               MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature
               fanfare theme. Once more, the hotel conference room jammed
               with press. Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat,
               shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium. Flashes
               start POPPING.

          

                                                                     22.

                    The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll,
                    upstaged by upstart social worker,
                    seems madder than a rich wet hen.
                    Hey Mabel, tell us about your
                    rival!
          The sound switches to Mabel leaning her sultry voice to the
          mikes...

                              MABEL
                    Well, how would any woman feel
                    about some tart who steals her man?
          Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE.

                              MABEL (CONT'D)
                    Bill Stultz and I were going to
                    make history together, until this
                    poor little social worker and her
                    sugar daddy, oh excuse me,
                    `publisher,' started throwing money
                    and I don't know what else at him.

                                EPORTER
                    Mabel, are you implying Miss
                    Earhart used her feminine charms on
                    your pilot?

                              MABEL
                    I don't know, Charlie, I never seen
                    her. Has she got any?
          LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.   She shows them a smoky
          smile, but stays on message.

                              MABEL (CONT'D)
                    Well, she had to use something on
                    somebody to get from nowhere to
                    here. You figure it out, or wait
                    til George Putnam feeds it to you.
          Two dozen questions at once.   She's not even listening.

                              MABEL (CONT'D)
                    We're going to Canada, waiting for
                    some good weather on the Atlantic,
                    and then we'll kick Little Miss
                    Whoozis in the keester.

                              REPORTER
                    What makes you so cocky that she
                    won't leave first?

                            go to China. That thing they're
                            flying can't load enough gas to
                            make Yonkers. Tell that to
                            Putnam's girlie. And while you're
                            at it...
               She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her.

                                      MABEL (CONT'D)
                            Tell her I do wear silver.   So I'm
                            two up on her.

               MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. We are looking at foggy, bleak
               Trepassey Harbor as the Friendship makes an unsuccessful
               attempt to take off.

                                      ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                            Eleven days of failure for plucky
                            Amelia Earhart and her crew. If it
                            isn't storms over the Atlantic,
                            it's the inability of the
                            seaplane's pontoons to lift from
                            the sea.

                            Perhaps it's for the best.
                            Remember, no woman has beat the
                            jinx of the Atlantic and three have
                            died trying. Including a princess
                            and the niece of former President
                            Woodrow Wilson.
               The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS.     It floats on the

                            Maybe this one's not to be. Hey,
                            Mabel! How's your weather report?

               Amelia coming down the hotel corridor. She passes a room,
               and hearing DRUNKEN LAUGHTER from a group of MEN within the
               room...
               She stops.    Stares at the door with more concern than anger.

               Amelia curled up on her bed with CHARTS of the Atlantic
               spread everywhere. From next door, the sound of drunken men

               CONTINUE.
               Amelia looks down from her charts.       Her mind going to...

               Seven-year-old KIDS dressed as cowboys and Indians are
               gathered on the front lawn of a white clapboard home. We
               CLOSE on a clear-eyed tomboy with war paint and tousled hair,
               AMELIA at seven, looking up excitedly as a car pulls to the
               curb.

               H
                er FATHER climbs slowly from the car, WOBBLES his way across
               the lawn. The kids part to let him through, the confusion
               and disappointment on every face. He ignores them all, even
               Amelia. The front door opens...
               ...Amelia's MOTHER gazes at him with shame and disdain.         As
               she helps him stagger inside...

               Amelia in her flight gear, sitting on the edge of her bed, an
               open TELEGRAM lies beside her. Her elbows rest on her knees.
               Her hands are locked together. Her profile is stony,
               determined. TILT DOWN to the telegram...
               It reads:    WEATHER PERMITTING, MABEL FLIES THIS AFTERNOON.
               She grabs her flight bag, leaves the room. She only has to
               travel as far as the next door. POUNDS on it. Waits.
               Pounds LOUDER with both fists.
               Slim opens the door.      Looking bad.   Bill sits up in bed,
               groggy, disoriented.

                                      BILL
                            Christ, what time is...

          

                                                                      25.

          

          

          

                              AMELIA
                    Time to fly. Get up, get dressed,
                    we're going now.
          She is calm and angry at once.    A powerful combination.   Slim
          pulls his pants off a chair.

                              BILL
                    Where's the weather report?
          She goes to his bed. Hands him a slip of paper.     He blinks,
          still waking up. Reads.

                              BILL (CONT'D)
                    It's not good enough.

                              AMELIA
                    Great. Maybe Mabel will think so,
                    too. Because if she doesn't, she's
                    going to Paris and you're going
                    home. Today.

                               ILL
                    It's not good enough.

                              AMELIA
                    It's fine, there's a tail wind all
                    the way, we'll off-load to 700
                    gallons, which gets us off the
                    water and the wind gets us to
                    Ireland.

                              BILL
                    We've had better than this and we
                    haven't gone.

                                AMELIA
                    But this   is the day Mabel's ready,
                    so we're   going now. The weather
                    is going   to get better and we'll
                    be there   to enjoy it.

                              BILL
                    You're serious.

                              AMELIA
                    Just as serious as you're hung
                    over.
                        (to Slim)
                    You go now, get the late weather,
                    we'll meet you at the plane.
          Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his
          bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his
          commander.

          

                                                                          26.

                             (QUIET)
                         Slim, get out. I've got this.
               A beat. Slim goes, the door shuts quietly.     Amelia sits on
               the edge of Bill's bed.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         I've loved one person
                         unconditionally, Bill. He is the
                         most caring and generous and
                         charming and flat-out funny guy
                         I'll ever know. He's my father.
               Her eyes are burning with this.    And Bill keeps quiet.
               Anyone would.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         He's a drunk. And he's let me down
                         all my life.
               She leans closer.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         Now you get out of that bed. And
                         you fly that god-damned thing to
                         Ireland. Or I swear to you,
                         Bill...
               Just above a whisper...

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         I swear to you I will. Or die
                         trying.

               Y
                ou got that?   Do you?

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         And either way. You're going to be
                         living with it.

          

          

          25                                                                25

               EXT. TREPASSEY HARBOR - LATER

               It's dark and cold. Bill and Amelia stand at the dock beside
               their plane. He's drinking coffee as they watch Slim come
               down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand. Amelia steps
               forward to take it. Reads with neutral eyes.

                                      AMELIA
                         Good.     Slim, start the engines.
               She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a
               pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine
               KICKS to life...

               She hands the weather report to Bill.    He reads.   Looks to
               her eyes.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         You signed a contract. You've got
                         a direct instruction from me to go.
                         That report indicates some degree
                         of risk and it's a risk I'm taking.

                                   BILL
                         Have a nice flight.

                                    AMELIA
                         Thanks.
               She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins,
               starts to climb up, looking back at Bill...

                                   SLIM
                         Hey, I'm scared shitless of this
                         dame.
               She climbs up after him.   One look back...

                                   AMELIA
                         Read tomorrow's papers, Bill.
                         We'll both be in them.
               And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines
               REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step
               toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch...

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         So, to take off, you pull back
                         on the thing, right?
               Her perfectly straight, innocent face.    He BUSTS out
               laughing. This fucking girl.

               T
                osses his coffee.   Climbs aboard.

               WITH Amelia as she locks the hatch. For the first time, we
               can see the inside of the plane. The cabin is too small for
               anyone to stand. The plane has been emptied of everything
               but two huge elliptical FUEL TANKS.
                he wedges herself between the gigantic tanks. Bill pulls
               the throttle and the Fokker Tri-motor LURCHES forward,
               STRAINING against the surface of the sea in a rattling,
               throbbing desperately VIBRATING all-out attempt.

          

                                                                           28.

          

          

          
               Amelia crawls to the tiny window, her face to the glass as
               chop and spray FLY PAST like shrapnel, and the engines WHINE
               and PULSE louder...
               ...twenty seconds, thirty. Still on the surface. Forty
               seconds, fifty, her eyes shut, her forehead bangs against the
               glass, come on, sixty seconds, and at 67...

          

          

          27                                                                 27

          28                                                                 28
               Amelia kneels at the tiny window. A kid on a rainy day.
               Only outside this window is impenetrable FOG and a STORM that
               ROCKS the plane like the shock waves of endless explosions.
               As she braces herself against the hull...
               ...water DRIPS onto her from a loose seam. Could this be
               dangerous? She looks around. Through the opening between
               the elliptical fuel tanks...
               ...Bill and Slim at the controls. Bill is banging on
               something beside the instrument panel. Beneath his seat, she
               sees the TOOLBOX. The water drips on her faster. She crawls
               forward toward the boys, arriving to see...
               ...Bill POUNDING what we can now see is his RADIO.   His face
               is red, angry. She watches for a beat.

                                        AMELIA

                            YOU OKAY?

                                      BILL

                            BE BETTER IF OUR DAMN RADIO WOULD

                            JOIN THE PARTY!
               He never turns to her, but she studies him. Is he impaired
               or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox from beneath his
               seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the
               box...
               ...there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey.
               She stares at it as we SNAP TO...

          

          

          29                                                                 29

               FLASHBACK:    EXT. AMELIA'S HOUSE, ATCHISON, KANSAS - DAY

               RAPID SERIES OF ANGLES. War-painted Amelia looking up from
               the cowboy she's tied to a tree. The car pulling to the
               curb. Out climbs...

          

                                                                        29.

          

          

          
               ...her FATHER glassy-eyed.   Stumbling through the children.
               Her MOTHER at the door.
               ANGLE. Amelia still in war paint enters her parents' room
               She knows just where to go. Opens a drawer, digs beneath
               crisply starched shirts. Finds the BOTTLE.
               ANGLE. Amelia in the bathroom, POURING the bottle out into
               the sink. She looks up in the mirror to see...
               ...her father in the doorway. She turns straight to him.
               MEETS his eyes, direct and unafraid.

          

          

          30                                                               30

               INT. FRIENDSHIP

               BACK to Amelia with Bill's bottle, as the battered plane
               lurches every which way in the storm. She lifts it from the
               toolbox. Hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane
               DROPS fifty feet, and Amelia is SLAMMED against the ceiling,
               then crashes back to the floor. Dazed, she sees Bill turned
               around...

                                   BILL

                         HOLD ONTO SOMETHING FOR CHRISSAKE!
               She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been
               bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make
               it.

                                    AMELIA (V.O.)
                         Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last
                         grand adventure. I wish I had won,
                         but it was worthwhile anyway. You
                         know that.     I have no faith we'll
                         meet anywhere again, but I wish we
                         might.
               HOLD on the gray eyes.   DISSOLVE TO...
               LATER. Amelia at the window, still opaque with fog.
               Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the
               clouds. There to the south, a FREIGHTER running across our
               path. No land in sight.

               A
                melia SCRAWLS a note, ties it to an ORANGE from her flight
               bag, and crawls back to the boys.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)

                         HOW FAR TO LAND?
               The boys are studying the freighter.

          

                                                                      30.

          

          

          

                                BILL

                    RADIO'S   STILL OUT. NO WAY TO

                    COMPUTE   WINDSPEED AND DRIFT IN THE

                    FOG, SO   GOD ONLY KNOWS WHERE

                    IRELAND   IS.
          Checks his watch.

                              BILL (CONT'D)

                    NINETEEN HOURS PLUS. WE'VE GOT

                    MAYBE AN HOUR OF PETROL LEFT.

                    PROBABLY LESS.
          She shows him the note and the orange.

                              AMELIA

                    WESTERN UNION, SPECIAL DELIVERY.
          Bill has to smile. Are you serious? As a heart attack.
          Okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked
          and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia...
          ...DROPS the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy
          winds CARRY it two hundred yards WIDE of the mark. Our three
          stare grimly.

                              AMELIA (CONT'D)

                    IF WE LAND NEAR THEM, WE'VE GOT A

                    RESCUE.
          Their eyes are locked.

                              BILL

                    THINK THOSE RIDICULOUS SKIS COULD

                    HOLD US UP IN THIS KIND OF SEA?
          She's been wondering the same.

                              BILL (CONT'D)

                    YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

                    ARE YOU A LIAR?

                              AMELIA

                    NOT ON THIS OCCASION.
          A rare smile...

                              BILL

                    WELL, THEN.
          And SWOOPS back on course.   Amelia's hand squeezes his
          shoulder. DISSOLVE TO...
          LATER. Amelia crouched behind Bill's seat.       Fog starting to
          break up.

          

                         A

               Her face drawn, she almost seems to be holding her breath.
               Something down below. As we drop, we hear the engines

                                    A

               SPUTTER.

                                    MELIA

                         WHEN'S THAT HOUR OF FUEL RUN OUT?

                                   BILL

                         EIGHTEEN MINUTES AGO.   WHY?
               She glances over to Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich.
               She can't believe this. He takes a healthy bite.

                                   AMELIA

                         THE LONGER I OBSERVE MEN THE MORE

                         I AM AWESTRUCK. BY THEIR CAPACITY

                         FOR DENIAL.
               She crawls back to the navigation table. As she looks out
               her window, a SANDWICH SAILS past! She WHIPS around...Slim's
               arms raised in jubilation. Down below...
               Land.

          

          

               EXT. SHORE, BURRY PORT, WALES - DAY


          31                                                                31
               The little plane sputtering, shuddering, as Bill drops in for
               a splashdown. We PAN to the shore...
               ...a rural railroad dock. Deserted except for THREE WORKERS
               who glance up as the Friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred
               yards offshore. Amelia at the hatch, tiny in distance, WAVES
               a towel...
               ...one friendly worker takes off his coat and WAVES back.
               Then all three guys go back to work. SNAP TO...
               REVERSE ANGLE. From the Friendship, we watch the workers
               ignoring us. Bill and Slim HOLLER and jump up and down on
               the pontoons. Nobody cares. Amelia sits in the doorway, her
               legs swinging free.

                                   AMELIA
                         Out of gas. May have to swim for

                           t.
               LATER. Amelia alone. Six pages written by her side. Still
               working, as a rowboat pulls up. Bill stands in the bow.
               Calls to her...

                                   BILL
                         Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there's
                           fella coming from London. Hilton
                         Railey.

          

                                                                     32.

          

          

          

                                AMELIA
                      Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More
                      important than any of us.
          Really?    Yep.

                                BILL
                      He says ya mustn't come ashore til
                      he gets here. No matter what.
          Great.    She doesn't like it, but there it is.   She waves, so
          long.

                                BILL (CONT'D)
                      Some kind of royalty, is he?
          She nods.

                                AMELIA
                      Public relations.
          Goes back to work.    DISSOLVE TO...
          LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her
          feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of...
          ...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the
          water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her
          things.
          LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the
          Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our
          VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring
          past him, vaguely apprehensive.
          REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN
          swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand.
          The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were
          staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim
          help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia
          jumps out, the crowd...

          .
           ..begins to soberly APPLAUD, and slowly CLOSES IN around
          her. At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand
          thrust toward her. She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have
          been shunted to the back. Suddenly...
          ...people get BOLDER. CLAPPING her on the back, reaching to
          TOUCH her, someone SNATCHES her scarf, she looks around
          frantically for Bill and Slim as...
          ...a SHERIFF and three DEPUTIES muscle their way to her using
          billy clubs to push people back. They surround Amelia, begin
          to escort her to the station...

          

                                                                           33.

          

          

          

                                   SHERIFF
                         Sorry Ma'am. Shoulda brought
                         more men.

                                   AMELIA
                         No, really, this is very sweet,
                         it's an honor. I'm actually
                         enjoying it.

                                   SHERIFF
                         That's a good thing.
               She looks at him as they are jostled along.

                                   SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                         Because you're stuck with it.
                         From here on.
               She is brought to a smiling avuncular HILTON RAILEY, standing
               beside the closest thing Burry Port has to a limo. She
               throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek.

                                   AMELIA
                         Hullo, Hilton.
               Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's
               brought photographers with him. And more.

               A hearty handshake.   She holds out her sheets of paper.

                                   AMELIA
                         I believe you've come for these.
               Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come

               MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. The British press are gathered

               Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas.

                         credit of Bill and Slim. Women
                         should know, however, that I have
                         had 500 hours solo flying and once
                         held the women's altitude record.

                         So you could have done it yourself!

                         This particular flight, under these
                         conditions, I wonder if anyone but
                         Bill Stultz could have pulled it
                         off. But certainly, one day a
                         woman will do this. As easily, as
                         skillfully, as professionally as
                         any man.
               Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that.

                            Aviation is clear today for the
                            pioneer. And if the pioneer has
                            good ideas nobody will ask whether
               P            the pioneer is a man or woman.
                olite applause.       Mostly from women.   She looks around the

                            I hear your doubt. That doubt is
                            our challenge. This is where our
                            Atlantic flight, or any other good
                            flight by a woman can help...

               Amelia flanked by George and Dorothy, coming out of a

                            Guess you can burn those letters.
               Dorothy wonders.       Letters?

                                      GEORGE
                            I saved them for your book.
               One simple shake of Amelia's head.       A soft...

                                      AMELIA
                            The book's yours.     The letters are

               He smiles.       Bows in submission.

                                      GEORGE
                             ou're the boss.

                        (to Amelia)
                    Do you think there's enough of him
                    to boss for the two of us?
          Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs.

                              AMELIA
                    Barely enough for one.

                    Miss Earhart, can you tell us some-
                    thing about your future plans?

                    Well, being a social worker by
                    trade and passion, I'll be going
                    back to work at Denison House when
                    all this fun is over.
          She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it.

                              AMELIA (CONT'D)
                    ...if I haven't been fired.
          George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him
          with a mischievous smile. And with no warning...
          ...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a
          cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to
          George, who...
          ...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into
          traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers
          or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo.
          George watching her go.    Dorothy watching George.

                    Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social

                    comfortable as a celebrity so
                    quickly?
          George smiles.   His eyes still following Amelia.

                              GEORGE
                    The truth is, she was a celebrity
                    on smaller stages all her life.

               EXT. PUTNAM HOME, RYE, NEW YORK - DAY

               Amelia in a sunlit garden ringed by trees. She sits at a
               folding table, writing longhand. A large dog lies at her
               feet.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.)
                         So they took me home with them to
                         Rye. And I lived there, while I
                         wrote my book.
               PULL BACK to see our view has been George's. He sits at an
               antique writing desk, watching her through a picture window.
               He rises slowly. We see that he has been reviewing a
               CONTRACT, which he takes with him.

               A
                NGLE. Amelia writing, looking up to see George coming down
               the back porch steps to the garden.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         I thought he'd be a tyrant and that
                         I would have to manage him.
               He smiles as he approaches.   She goes back to work.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         Instead he was kind and generous.
                         And only picked the fights he
                         needed to win.
               He drops the contract on her table.     She looks at it.

                                   GEORGE
                         Lucky Strike endorsement.      I wrote
                         the copy myself.

                                   AMELIA
                         What does it say?   `I don't smoke
                         but you should?'

                                   GEORGE
                         It says Lucky Strikes were the only
                         cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
                         That's true.

                                    AMELIA
                         True and misleading.      Why would I
                         sign that?

                                   GEORGE
                         So Bill and Slim get paid.

          

                                                                         38.

          

          

          
               Oh.   His smile simple, comfortable.

                                     GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          If you're too proud to take tobacco
                          money, donate it to Byrd's
                          expedition, and we get great
                          publicity.
               She stares at him with hard eyes. His smile just becomes
               more relaxed. An easy win, no big deal. She begins to sign
               the contract. He places a stack of letters in front of her.

                                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          This week's marriage proposals.

                          It's from Sing Sing.
               She starts to read.    Her eyes widen.   Goodness.
                                      AMELIA (reads)
                          `...in the prison yard, so everyone

                                    DOROTHY (O.S., approaching)
                          Have you no shame, George? No
                          sense of the scandal you create?
               They look up.   She has a tray of lemonade and cookies.

                                    DOROTHY (CONT'D)
                          You make her work for nothing. At
                          least you can feed her.

                          Are you done yet? If not, make him
                          write the rest, he will anyway.

               A women's college.    The hall is packed.

                                    GEORGE (V.O.)
                          The lecture and publicity schedule
                          was fierce. I was with her pretty
                          much all the time.
               Amelia and George alone in the wings.

          

                                                                     39.

          

          

          

                              GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    This was the moment of opportunity.
                    Could we launch her into Lindbergh
                    status as a permanent icon, before
                    her name fell out of the news-
                    papers.
          He re-ties her scarf.   Checking out the effect.

                              GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    We had separate agendas. For her,
                    it was the advancement of aviation
                    and of women.
          He very slightly rearranges her hair, as if every lock
          matters.

                              GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    As for me, I liked to tell myself
                    it was about the money. Though
                    there was never much of that left
                    over.
          She stands for inspection, with her trace of a teasing smile.
          He holds out his hand and she gives him her note cards.

                              GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Really, it was about the chance
                    to be around her.
          He flips through the A
                               cards, frowning as he goes.
                               MELIA (George imitation)
                    This will never do, A.E., simply
                    unacceptable.
          He looks up.   She starts pacing around, gesturing as he
          would...
                              AMELIA (George imitation)
                    You need more ammunition in these
                    cards, and where's the goddamned
                    humor, for Chrissake? By which I
                    mean something actually funny!
          He's trying to look annoyed.   It isn't easy.
                              AMELIA (George imitation)
                    And please remember not to turn
                    your pretty little backside to the
                    crowd when you use your pointer,
                    it's your face they're paying to
                    see. Well, most of them.
          She WHIPS around.   He's deadpan.

          

                                                                            40.

          

          

          
                                     AMELIA (George imitation)
                           And another thing. Your hats.
                           Are a menace.
               Staring at each other.
                                     GEORGE (softly)
                           Everything about you. Is a menace.
               The stare holds.   Because this is the moment.

                                     AMELIA (V.O.)
                           I remember the first kiss.
               It is only one step.     Her hand goes to his chest.    Her eyes
               close, as...
               She brings her mouth to his.     Tender and strong.    And deep.
               It is an act of decision.
               A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from
               the podium. But she keeps looking at him. And as the
               APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she finally...
               ...turns. STRIDES onto the stage, with one graceful wave,
               she brings the applause to a crescendo.

                                      AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           Of course, I knew all the stories

                           T
                             hat Dorothy had been having a
                           torrid affair with Fred Upton.
                           Everyone did.
               She steps to the microphone.     The crowd quiets.

                                     AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           But I didn't kiss him because I
                           felt sorry for him. Or because
                           it would mean the world to him.
               INTERCUT.   George in the wings.    His heart in his eyes.

                                       AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           I did it.    Because I wanted to.
               He looks down.   He's still holding her cards.

          

          

               INT. HOTEL, CHICAGO - DAY


          38                                                                  38
               Hotel corridor. An elevator OPENS and ELINOR SMITH a
               striking young woman emerges. Looks at a slip of paper.
               Nervous. Heads down the hallway to a door. As she gathers
               herself to knock, she looks scared enough to pass out.

          

                                                                   41.

          

          

          
          George answers the door, looking gracious and suave. They
          shake hands. Then, Amelia appears, warmly clasping the
          girl's hand, and Elinor looks as starstruck as a teenager at
          the Oscars.

                              AMELIA
                    It's so good to meet you. I've
                    been following your career with
                    a great deal of admiration.

                               ELINOR
                    Um.   Thanks, and.   You, too.

                              AMELIA
                    Feel like a drink?

                               GEORGE
                    Amelia!   What would her mother
                    say?

                              AMELIA
                    Relax, George. I meant a Coke.
          As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the
          girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly
          ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others,
          the kid reacts. Oh, my.

          L
           ATER. Tea in the sitting room.    Elinor leaning forward,
          guileless, eager...

                              ELINOR
                    They're saying you get $500 a week
                    on the lecture circuit.

                      GEORGE                          AMELIA
          On a bad week.                  On a good week.

          
          The girl looks from one to the other.

                              AMELIA
                    All depends. On whether you want
                    the sell or the real.

                              ELINOR
                    Oh, I don't underestimate the value
                    of selling. It's why I'm here.

                              GEORGE
                    A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude
                    record, then makes headlines
                    illegally flying under the four
                    bridges of the East River. You
                    don't seem to need much help
                    selling yourself.

          

                                                                       42.

          

          

          

                                   ELINOR
                         Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was
                         hoping you could do to me what
                         you've done to her.
               Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching
               this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh-
               oh.

                                   ELINOR (CONT'D)
                         What I mean is. It's a good thing.
                         That's why I want it.
               Now our couple is trying not to laugh.

                                   GEORGE
                         Just so we're clear, young lady.
                         What is your primary ambition?
                                   ELINOR (straight back)
                         To take Amelia's place as the
                         number one female pilot.
               The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically
               dumbstruck.

                                   AMELIA
                         Well, good for you! I would have
                         expected nothing less. You want
                         a tip?

                                   ELINOR
                         I do.

                                   AMELIA
                         Keep doing what you're doing.
               The girl nods, seriously.    Okay.

                                    A

                                    MELIA (CONT'D)
                         And don't let anyone turn you
                         around.

          

          

               INT. PUTNAM HOUSE - CHRISTMAS DAY


          39                                                             39
               Holiday party in progress. Christmas decorations everywhere.
               A small crowd around the living room bar where George is
               telling a story.
               Now we see Dorothy standing, drinking, watching George with
               hard eyes. She turns on her heels and walks OUT into the
               garden. George sees this, excuses himself, follows her, as
               we PAN to...

          

                                                                         43.

          

          

          
               ...Amelia standing with a group of guests.    She's seen it
               all.

          

          

          40                                                                 40

               EXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Here she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming.
               A figure comes up behind her. Falls in step.

                                   GEORGE
                         Lovely party, huh?

                                   DOROTHY
                         Depends on your point of view.
                         I've been listening to some idiot
                         brag about his girlfriend.
               Still walking.   She never looks at him.

                                   GEORGE
                         Well, in that case, for your
                         information, it is a lovely party
                         indeed. Anything on your mind?

                                   DOROTHY
                         It's not so much that my husband
                         is having an affair with his meal
                         ticket. It's just a pity we can't
                         have one honest conversation about
                         it.

                                   GEORGE
                         What's wrong with this one? A
                         promising start, I'd say, in the
                         honesty department.
               She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our
               ANGLE we can now see D
                                    Amelia in the window, watching them.

                                    OROTHY
                         If this is what you call an honest
                         talk, I'd say you need some
                         practice.

                                   GEORGE
                         Great. Let's try one about you
                         and Fred Upton.
               She stops walking.   Turns in shock, to see his easy smile.

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         Well, I'm waiting for our practice
                         conversation. Hoping I'll learn
                         something. About honesty.

          

                                                                           44.

          

          

          
               She GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a
               car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects.
               As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the
               window. He stops. Their look holds.

          

          

               INT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT


          41                                                                 41
               George at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A
               HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by
               a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly...

                                    GEORGE
                          Dorothy and I are through.
               She sits beside him.     Very close.

                                    AMELIA
                          For a long, long time.

                                    GEORGE
                          It's different now.
               She looks at him.   Squints.    How?

                                       GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          Marry me.
               Oh.   A breath.

                                    AMELIA
                          I can't do that.

                                     GEORGE
                          If you give it a chance, you'll
                          learn to love me.
               He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling?

                                    AMELIA
                          I already love you.    That's why I
                          can't marry you.
                                    GEORGE (a murmur)
                          Well, that explains it. For a
                          minute there, I thought you were
                          stuck for an excuse.

               S
                he comes close enough to kiss.

                                       AMELIA
                          I know me.     And you don't.   Not
                          really.

                                    GEORGE
                          What if I promise not to learn?

          

                                                                         45.

          

          

          

                                   AMELIA
                         The day will come. When I will run
                         away. And when it does...
               He stops her with a kiss.

                                   GEORGE
                         If you love me. I'll take my
                         chances.
               He stares in her troubled eyes.   There is no answer.

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         Race you to bed.

               Amelia and nearly 20 WOMEN lined up in front of planes.
               Waving, smiling, talking to each other.

                                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely
                         competitors say hello to the press
                         announcing the First Women's Air
                         Derby, racing from Santa Monica to
                         Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers
                         `the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals
                         certainly know how to capture our
                         attention.
               The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues
               bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but
               maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste.

          

          

               INT. RECEPTION AREA, PUTNAM'S - DAY


          43                                                               43
               The crowded waiting room. We CLOSE on a young woman we
               scarcely recognize. It is Elinor. Though less than a year
               has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised.
               ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to
               George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the
               phone.              G
                                    EORGE (into phone)
                         Because Amelia invented the Powder
                         Puff Derby for female pilots. Then
                         the men running the damn race
                         suddenly decide every woman has to
                         carry a male navigator, and start
                         from east of the Rockies so they
                         won't crash into the mountains!
               Listens, impatient.

          

                                                                   46.

          

          

          
                              GEORGE (into phone)
                    I'll tell you why it's a front page
                    story. Because Amelia pulled every
                    woman out of the race. So the
                    organizers had to roll over and
                    give in, or they'd have lost their
                    shirts. You want me to write your
                    headline?
          He glances over.   Elinor in the doorway.
                              GEORGE (into phone)
                    Call you back. I've got a very
                    important guest.
          He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit.   As she
          does...

                              ELINOR
                    Wish I was important enough for
                    you to manage.

                              GEORGE
                    Well, I've just got one client.
                    And most days she's more than I
                    can manage.
          Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.

                              ELINOR
                    Get in line behind the boys she
                    smacked around on the Derby.
          He grins back.   You bet.

                              ELINOR (CONT'D)
                    Some of the gal flyers had their
                    doubts about her...well, her skill
                    level. But she's everyone's
                    champion now.

                              GEORGE
                    And both of those things.      Are the
          S         reasons I called you.
           trange words.   He has her attention.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    I think it would be huge for women
                    flyers if Amelia won the Derby.
                    The publicity would put the race,
                    and all of you, up there with the
                    boys.

          

                                                             47.

          

          

          

                                 ELINOR
                       I'm not sure she has much of a
                       chance, Mr. Putnam.

                                 GEORGE
                       Well, the one shot would be putting
                       her in a far more powerful plane
                       than anything she's flown. We're
                       thinking the Lockheed Vega.
          The girl's shock.    He really means this.

                                 ELINOR
                       Sir, I've test piloted the Vega.
                       It's way more than she could ever
                       handle. It wouldn't be safe, let
                       alone successful.
          He smiles.

                                 GEORGE
                       That's why I'm thinking of you
                       flying with her. You could handle
                       the cross-country flying, the more
                       difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75
                       a week.
          Elinor WHISTLES low.

                                 ELINOR
                       Well, I think that's the most
                       generous opportunity I've ever
                       been offered.
          He stares at her.

                                 GEORGE
                       There's just one thing. Obviously,
                       it has to appear that Amelia did
                       all the flying. So when pictures
                       are taken, you'll stand off to one
                       side.
          Her eyes narrow.    He's completely serious.

                                 ELINOR
                       In that case, I'll get my own plane
                       and win the race myself.

                                 GEORGE
                       You haven't changed.

          N
           o smile at all.

          

                                                                   48.

          

          

          

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Unfortunately for you, neither
                    have I.
          The look in his eye is not to be ignored.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    You can't win if you can't get a
                    plane to enter. Let me predict
                    that you won't.
          The voice calm and low and riveting.

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    In fact. If you reject my
                    generosity, you may come to regret
                    it. For a long, long time.

                              ELINOR
                    That's a threat.

                              GEORGE
                    I'm an intensely loyal person,
                    Elinor. And this is what my
                    loyalty requires.
          She's glaring.   Reeling.   Trapped.

                              ELINOR
                    She's the one who said I shouldn't
                    let anybody turn me around.

                              GEORGE
                    She probably meant me.
          So honest, the words confuse her.

                              ELINOR
                    Obviously, she doesn't see me as
                    a threat.

                              GEORGE
                    Oh, sure she does.
          A straight smile...

                              GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    She just doesn't care.
          ...which silently fades.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    My job.     Is to care for her.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO...

               INT. OAK ROOM, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT

               LONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight.
               PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to
               the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not
               returned. We CLOSE as they sit...

                                   GEORGE

                                   A
                          hat's wrong?
                                    MELIA (clearly furious)
                         What could be wrong? I had such a
                         lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith.
               Oh.

                                   GEORGE
                          he told you that I shut her out of
                         the Derby. And that's true.

                                   AMELIA
                         And when were you going to tell me?
                                   GEORGE (calm, straight)
                         Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And
                         I felt it needed to be done.
               She can scarcely believe this.

                                   AMELIA
                         What? You think I wanted it done,
                         but just let you do the dirty work?

                                   GEORGE
                         I didn't say that.

                                   AMELIA
                         Because I'm no angel. Business is
                         competition and competition is
                         rough, and I thank my stars that
                         you're there making this life
                         happen for me, but...

                          ou're making your life hap...

                                   AMELIA
                         But this is different.
               It is.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         If women are going to stab women in
                         the back, then women are going

                       You didn't do this for business,
                       anyway.   G

                                  EORGE
                       I did it for fun?

                       You did it because you love me.
          That stops him.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                       And when we're married, you mustn't
                       ever...
          Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                       What's the big shock? I thought
                       you wanted to get married.
          Full beat.

                                    GEORGE
                           did.   I do.

                                 AMELIA
                       Well, then.
          His eyes moving over her face.

                                 GEORGE
                       What about what you said? The day
          S            will come when you run away.
           he nods.    It will.

                                 AMELIA
                       You'll be destroyed. And part of
                       me will, too. And I think we both
                       know it.
          And yet.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                       Sometimes things happen that way.
                       You're not better safe than sorry.
          Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy.

          

                                                                          51.

                         Yes?
                                     GEORGE (a whisper)
                         Hell yes.

               INT. GEORGE'S MOTHER'S HOME, NOANK, CONNECTICUT - DAY

               Through a window, a dry, wintered garden. Snow falling, at
               once soft and heavy. Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse,
               Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound. One lonely fishing
               boat braves the cold water. PULL BACK to see...
               ...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room.     She is
               writing, and as she does...

               ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a
               small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia
               beckons George. The letter is in her hand.

               Amelia holds tight to George's hand, leading him out into the
               falling snow. She turns, fixes him with a look. Hands him
               the letter. And steps back. As if giving him space.
               At first, he smiles. What is this? She gestures for him to
               read. As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds.
               Then...

                                    AMELIA (V.O.)
                         ...I want you to understand I shall
                         not hold you to any medieval code
                         of faithfulness to me. Nor shall
                         I consider myself bound to you
                         similarly.
               Snow falling.    Absolute silence.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         If we can be honest I think the
                         difficulties which may arise may
                         best be avoided should you or I
                         become interested deeply, or in
                         passing, with anyone else.
               She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes.     He never looks
               up.

                         the other's work or play, nor let
                         the world see our private joys or
                         disagreements.
               And then...

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                         I
                           must exact a cruel promise. And
                         that is you will let me go in a
                         year if we find no happiness
                         together.
               He stops on this.    His thoughts unreadable.

                                   AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         I will try to do my best in every
                         way. And give you that part of me
                         you know and seem to want.
               He folds the letter carefully.    Places it in his pocket.       And
               smiles.

                                   GEORGE
                          y Amelia. Brutal in her frank-
                         ness. Beautiful in her honesty.
               He steps to her.    Looks in her eyes.   They kiss.

               LONG ANGLE. The minister reading the vows. The witnesses
               standing silent. Two black cats rubbing against George's
               ankles.

               George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored
               for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to
               Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him.

                          Hence, the article.
               Ah.   He nods.

                                    AMELIA (CONT'D)
                          I'm thinking of doing it solo.

               CLOSE on Amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants
               into the ground. We see patience, concentration.
               Contentment. After a moment...

                                    AMELIA
                          I'm surprised you're all right with
                          this...
               WIDEN ANGLE.     George kneeling beside her.   Happily planting
               his own.

                          Really.

                                    AMELIA
                          Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the
                          lecture. Five years since
                          Lindbergh, no one's made it solo,
                          so many of them died.
               He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the
               earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then...

                          ell, they were only men.   This is
                         different.
               She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil...

                                   AMELIA
                         I was waiting to hear that I'm only
                         doing this because I was just a
                         passenger last time, and I'd rather
                         die than go on living as a fraud..
               No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food
               fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George

                         But you don't think that, do you,
                          ear?

                                   GEORGE
                         Of course not. But if I did...
               She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally
               grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice.

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         ...all the more reason to say yes.

               slowly, far below us. The Vega waits.
               CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew
               in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not
               breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She
               knows the fear beneath his easy smile.
               He produces a RING, a band of black fibers.

                                   GEORGE
                         Elephant hair, I think you wear
                         it on your toe. It's good luck.
               He puts it in her hand.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         Anyway. That's what the elephant
                         told me.
               Amelia looks at the ring.   Turns it in her fingers.

          

                                                                     55.

                      to respect them. My favorite is...
          She glances up.

                                AMELIA (CONT'D)
                      We make our own luck, you and I.
                      Remember that.
          He will remember that.    And more.

                                GEORGE

                      No.
          He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her.

                                AMELIA (CONT'D)
                      All this? G

                      Sure.

                                AMELIA
                      Thank god, I thought you were going
                      to tear it in half.

                                GEORGE
                      I spent our money on ocean liner
                      passage to go bring you back. It's
                      non-refundable. So try to do your
                      part.
          She nods.   She'll try.   He doesn't want to leave her yet.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      So the Simpkin thing. What was all
                      that?

                                AMELIA
                      I put it in a letter. Which you'll
                      get if I don't make it. So...mixed
                      emotions, huh?
          He shakes his head.
                                GEORGE (very soft)
                      Either way, something to look
                      forward to.
          She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave
          him either.

          

                                                                        56.

               She leans up to kiss him. And again.    Feeling in her eyes
               that he will never forget.

               Amelia alone. Starry night.   12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS.
               A single fishing boat.

                         The weather report wasn't perfect.
                         But we knew our real chance was to
                         take weather that others wouldn't.
               Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.   Too high to fly over.

                         I closed the deal by choosing May
                         20, five years to the day from
                         Lindbergh's flight. It was too
                         good a sell for George to resist.

               A terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts
               and dips like a leaf in a gale.

                         ...was that my altimeter would conk

               Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.

                         The only way to have any sense of
                         altitude, was to keep dropping
                         toward the sea.

                     When the engines sputtered, that
                     was my low-level limit.
          A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles
          back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the
          nose UP, the engine COUGHS...
          ...and CLIMBS.

                     I was too busy to grasp how
                     impossible the situation had
                     become. The joke was...
          LATER.   Flying in and out of cloud cover.

                     All those months flying only with
                     instruments, I should have been
                     practicing without them.
          PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a
          vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed.

                               AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     I started to wonder if luck was
                     paying me back. For thinking I
                     knew the rules.
          A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night.

                               AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Then I smelled burning oil.
          She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in
          the manifold ring.  A

                                MELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     A bad weld, already a small flame.
                     It would be hours back to Canada,
                     trying to find an unlit field,
                     landing with a heavy fuel load.
          She stares at the little flame.   Is it growing bigger?

                               AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     I told myself, push on. After all,
                     if it was a stupid choice...
          LATER. Flying in blackness.    Rising, as the engines seem
          sluggish.

                               AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     ...no one would ever know.
          Suddenly, a FILM of SLUSH on the windscreen.

          

                                                                          58.

                         With seemingly no warning, there
                         was ice. The controls froze.
               And the Vega DIVES into a DIZZYING SPIN.

                         The ice happened twice more, and I
                         began to lose heart. Then I
                         remembered Lindbergh's book saying
                         the same thing happened to him.

                he sea DISAPPEARS below.   Only cloud.

                          reception room that first day.
                          Bless him for keeping me waiting.
               The FUEL GAUGE reads EMPTY. She switches on the RESERVE
               TANK. And as she DROPS back down into opaque clouds...
               ...she feels something. Her fingertips go to her left
               shoulder, and come away...
               Wet.   Slick.

                          The cockpit gauge was defective.
                          There was a steady trickle of fuel
                          down my neck.
               She looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping.

                          Toss-up whether the bigger danger
                          was running out of gas or going up
                          in a fireball. I had my answer in

               thing we can't see. Until we PAN through the wind screen to
               the leak in the manifold weld. The BLUE FLAME is startlingly
               LARGER, now LICKING its way along the surface of the
               fuselage...

                          The manifold weld began to
                          separate. I gauged the likelihood
                          of explosion at somewhere between
                          probable and inevitable.

                         The second human to fly the
                         Atlantic solo, she is the only one
                         ever to fly it twice. And she set
                         the record, man or woman, for the
                         fastest crossing. Fourteen hours
                         54 minutes.
               As she waves to the crowd...

                         Now it's America's turn to show our

               We are standing in the wings. Through the curtains, we
               GLIMPSE the eager, packed house in an auditorium. From the
               stage, a speaker DRONES, but backstage...
               ...George peeks out at the throng. When he looks back, we
               see Amelia, her troubled face. The folded newspaper in her
               hand.

                    `Only an average flyer, she has

          She looks up to him.

                              GEORGE
                     ell, I'm glad someone besides me
                    finally noticed.
          His smile is light.    Her eyes watching him.   Then...
                              AMELIA (reads)
                    `Using a man-made perfect machine,

          She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently...

                               GEORGE
                     hy would you even read that
                    garbage?

                              AMELIA
                    Well, it reminds me how much I owe
                    to the men of this world. Keeps me
                    humble.

          And softly...

                    He's a crackpot. Let it go.
          He points to the packed hall...

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Cheer up.     They're crazy about you.

          She looks down.   Self-doubt flickers.

                              AMELIA (CONT'D)
                    What have we really done?

                               AMELIA
                     That's not enough.

                               GEORGE
                     Most of them are women. And for
                     them, it's very much enough.
          She shakes her head.

                               AMELIA

                               GEORGE
                     The question is. Can any magnif-

                     less?     A

                     And no one throws a parade.
          Ah.   Well...

                               GEORGE
                     One day closer, then. To the day
                     when they won't think to throw one
                     for you.
          She doesn't turn.   She doesn't smile.

                               AMELIA
                     Reasoning with me. A magnificent
                     display of useless courage.
          He nods to himself.

                                GEORGE
                     And.   It's fun.
          From the stage...

          George begins to straighten Amelia's outfit, touching her
          hair, as he did long ago on the Copley Hotel roof.

          

                                                                      64.

          She's through the curtain, and the crowd CRACKLES with
          APPLAUSE as...
          ...George stands in the wings.   Proud.    And concerned.

          

                                                                         65.

               INT. TRAIN - DAY

               A train rumbles through countryside.    A private compartment
               finds Amelia staring out the window.    George studying her.

                                   GEORGE (V.O.)
                         The irony is, I'd finally put that
                         wedding day letter out of my mind.
                         Stopped watching every beautiful
                         accomplished man who crossed her
                         path.
               REVERSE ANGLE. Through the glass of our compartment door, a
               crowd stands jouncing against each other. Gazing at their
               Queen of the Skies.

                                   GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         I had a call from the Byrds.
                         They've asked us to dinner
                         Thursday.

                                   AMELIA
                         Thursday, I'll be in Boston.
                         Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul
                         Collins.
               Said lightly. Not even looking at him.     While through the
               glass, it's become quite a tussle.

                                   GEORGE
                         Don't tell me Gene wants to
                         resurrect Transcontinental?

                                   AMELIA
                         No, he's starting a shuttle
                         service. Washington, New York,
                         Boston...
               One woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her
               place.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         Could be a money maker for us.    Get
                         me off the lecture grind.
               He stares in her eyes.   Almost as if looking for something.

                                   GEORGE
                         Gene's a dashing guy. He could
                         talk anyone into anything.
               Their look holds.

          

                                                                           66.

               INT. RESTAURANT, BOSTON - NIGHT

               PAN the dark, elegant restaurant. In a corner by the fire-
               place, Amelia and her dinner companions are being served
               lobsters. GENE VIDAL leans to Amelia as he speaks, and she
               hangs on every word.

                                   GENE
                         Transcontinental was too ambitious.
                         Too many hops, too tough on the
                         ladies. But the shuttle...
               A lean athlete's body, easy grace in every movement.
               Strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect,
               but kindness and decency.

                                   GENE (CONT'D)
                         Washington, New York, Boston. I
                         think it's the future. Will you
                         go there with us?
               She's trying to crack her lobster, but can't take her eyes
               off her host.

                                   AMELIA
                         What on earth would you need me
                         for?
               She's making a real mess of the lobster.    Gene notices.   PAUL
               COLLINS doesn't...

                                    PAUL
                         Hasn't George taught you anything?
                         Lady Lindy, the queen of the air,
                         the best known woman in the entire
                         U.S. of A?
               Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins
               cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and
               tries to concentrate.

                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                         Gene on the poster with you.
                         Legendary athlete at West Point,
                         two events in the Olympics, a top
                         pilot who should be running the
                         skies for Roosevelt when he wins...

          

                                                                     67.

          

          

          
          Gene looks up at Paul, as if to say: Enough. Now he smiles
          at Amelia. She blinks, what? Don't you want your lobster?

                               G
          Oh. She starts eating...
                                ENE (looking only at Amelia)
                     Thanks, Paul. I think you've even
                     talked me out of it.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO...
          LATER. Paul has gone. Gene and Amelia are at the bar,
          huddled over his beer and her Coke.

                                AMELIA (V.O.)
                     Gene had a terrible marriage and
                     was separated from his alcoholic
                     adulterous wife. But he was too
                     kind to humiliate her with a
                     divorce...
          Gene drains the last of his beer.

                     As a result, he was basically a
                     single parent to their young son,
                     Gore.
          He glances at his watch.      Wow.

                     I'm rattling on here, and you've
                     got a morning train.
          But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last
          chance to ask...

                               AMELIA
                     How's Nina doing?

                     Oh, fine.
          Really?   He smiles, gently.

                                GENE (CONT'D)
                     Actually, she hasn't been feeling
                     her best. She'll probably summer
                     in Newport. So my kid's stuck with

                    Gore would love that. He has a
                    little crush, I'm afraid.

          He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem
          to convey a depth of understanding.

                              GENE
                    The next adventure.    What is it?
          She shrugs.    No idea.

                    Because we're running out of

               A taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. Warmly lit,
               music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as yard
               lights go ON.
               As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia
               BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his
               arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to...
               George watching it all from the doorway.    His easy smile

               talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach
               the door...
               George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and
               CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as
               Amelia leads them inside.
               The door closes.   We hear laughter.

               Amelia on her knees, tending to her garden. She seems happy

               Starts weeding.

                    Sorry.

                              GEORGE
                    It's all right. You've been
                    distracted lately.
          No spin on that.   If G
                                anything, the tone is kind.

                    Listen, I've put together a month

                    licensing deals, open new
                    markets...
          She doesn't look up.

                              AMELIA
                    When are you leaving?

                                 GEORGE
                    Thing is.     I'd like you to come.
          She stiffens only slightly.     Can he sense it?

                              AMELIA
                    I don't really see how I can.

                              GEORGE
                    I've talked to the promoters,
                    they'll switch some lecture dates
                    for us.
          Now he's looking at her profile.     Saddened, if not surprised,
          by what he sees.

                              AMELIA
                    Well, it's not just that. There's
                     y work on the shuttle, we're at a
                    critical stage, and...I've just
                    started as Gene's consultant at the
                    Aeronautics Branch...
          She knows he's watching.    Shakes her head.    Keeps on working.

                              GEORGE
                    Normally, I'd be worried about
                    leaving you here alone. But I
                    suppose that won't be a problem,
                    will it?
          She stops now. Looks up at him.      If he wants a direct
          conversation, he can have it.

                                      GEORGE
                            I think I've just said it.
               A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both
               sides.
                                      GEORGE (softly)
                            Is there anything you want to say?
               She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with
               affection.

                                      AMELIA
                            I can't think of anything helpful.
               He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly...
               Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She
               stares after him.

               H
                e disappears into the house.       She's still staring.

               CLOSE on George alone in his office.    He goes to the door,
               LOCKS it. His face is drawn, grim.

                                    EORGE (V.O.)
                         By this time, I had a side job as
                         chairman of the editorial board of
                         Paramount Pictures. So Amelia and
                         I bought a little place in Los
                         Angeles.
               He goes slowly back to his desk.   On it, sits a large
               cardboard CARTON.

                         She was out there, preparing for a
                         flight, when our home in Rye burned
                         to the ground.
               We SEE that the contents of the box, papers, small objects,
               have been SINGED or CHARRED. He stares into it.

                         We both cried when I called to tell
                         her. She asked to come be with me.
                         But I insisted she stay there, to
                         keep on schedule for her flight.
               He reaches into the box...

                                   GEORGE (V.O.)
                         So many treasures lost. Letters

               Amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy, pleasant little home.
               The doors are open to the patio and yard. Winter is

                          still okay?
               INTERCUT George at his office. He's standing at the window,
               phone in one hand, single sheet of paper in the other. Like
               the other objects in the box, it is partially singed.

                          presence in a room recalls the
                          stars that watched us as we lay.
               BACK to Amelia.     Tears fill her eyes.
                                    GEORGE (reading)
                          I mark you in the moving crowd
                          And see again those stars a warm
                          night lent us long ago. We loved
                          so then. We love so now.
               INTERCUT George.     His eyes are dry.

                                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          Thank you for writing that.
               A beat.   His voice still softer...

               Her lips are parted.       She's searching for words.

                         or woman, to fly solo over half the
                         Pacific to California.
               Touching down, the cheering CROWD held back by police. As
               Amelia taxies to a stop, the crowd BREAKS THROUGH police
               lines and SURGES toward the plane.

                         by her daring solo across the Gulf.
                         As she passed over Washington,

                           Okay, it's all well and good to
                           tell us to study whatever we want,
                           and work at whatever we want, and

                       serious about this around-the-world

                       suitable `flying laboratory.'

                               G

                       As I said, I've sort of persuaded

                       and donors, tho. We have to get

                            Nah.
               She grins.

                            By the way. That's not the
                            surprise.
               It's not?    Uh-uh.   And he glances to...
               ...the window of the GALLERY they've stopped at. She sees a

               in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder...
               ...a small cat.     In a long frock coat.

                            Merry Christmas.
               Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she
               can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand...
               ...and strokes her hair.      He is her hero.   See it in her
               eyes.

                         As President Elliot has said, it
                         would be a shining adventure,
                         beckoning with new experiences.
                         Making me more useful to the
                         program here at Purdue.
               She looks into the eyes of each in turn...

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         It is much more. I believe that
                         women should do for themselves what
                         men have done - and occasionally
                         what men have not.
               Yes?

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         This might encourage other women
                         toward greater independence of
                         thought and action. And I know how
                         deeply you gentlemen desire that.
               There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         I know, of course, from my chats
                         earlier in the evening. With each
                         of your wives.
               More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then
               all.

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         In that spirit, I want each of you
                         to reach for your checkbooks...
               She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth
               of her own smile...

                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)
                         I mean that quite literally. This
                         is an opportunity for me to exhibit
                         the quality my husband admires

               INT. HANGAR - DAY

               The LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft with
               its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a
               huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a
               team of MECHANICS.
               Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen
               anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with
               barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease-
               stained overalls from working with the mechanics.

                                      GORE
                            So you'd be the first one, right?
                             ou always like that.
               First one?

                                      GORE (CONT'D)
                            To fly around the world.

                            Well, there's Magellan, 400 years
                             go. Actually, he didn't make it.
                            And he died. And he used a boat.

                                      GORE
                            So it's almost the same, except
                            it's completely different.

               He glowers at her.    She glowers back.

                            There are men who say they flew
                            around the world, but they didn't
                             ly around all of it.

                                      GORE
                            Because at higher latitudes, it's
                              short trip. At the North Pole,
                             ou just spin in a circle and
                            you've gone around the world.

                            So why are you asking? Just to
                            show how smart you are?

                                      GORE

                       Like at the equator.

          No answer.

                       Dare me.

                                   GORE
                       Okay.

                                   AMELIA
                       Okay.
          Is she serious?       She seems to be.

                                 GENE
                       Ask her about the Pacific. The
                       maximum range of the Electra is
                       4000 miles. And the closest land
                        est of Honolulu is farther than
                       that.
          Gore looks to her.       Well?

                                 AMELIA
                       I'll have to refuel.

                                   GORE
                       Where?

                                 AMELIA
                       In the air. One plane to another.
          The boy is staring at her now.       Staring.

                                 GORE
                       You're really going to do all this,

                     cream. Okay?
          The boy knows he's being dismissed. Looks from his dad to
          Amelia, who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss.

                     leave.
          Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore
          goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away from
          the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to...
          ...a little folding table, off in a corner.     She follows.
          Sits. Well...?       G

                      s that an opinion or an order?

               A Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman

               its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the
               left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the
               landing gear no longer exists.
               SIRENS SCREAM as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them.
               Amelia is ashen, disbelieving. Next to her, a gentle...

                         Good reaction, cutting the switch.
                         You saved our ass.
               She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to
               signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO...

               George wandering numbly on the airfield, as someone RUNS LIKE
               CRAZY from the office, shouting...

                          O ONE HURT!
               George alone on the tarmac.   Stops in his tracks.   Now he can
               cry.

               EXT. GARDEN, LOS ANGELES HOME - ALMOST SUNRISE

               Two figures in a garden, walking in light so spare they are
               silhouettes. Her head is down. His hands are in his
               pockets. We CLOSE on them as she fingers a blossom, we now
               see she is miserable, fighting absolute despair.

                                     GEORGE
                           Three weeks, she'll be good as new.
                           It's a remarkable crew. The best

                             hat...
               He stops.   Realizing where he was going.   She never looks up.

                                     AMELIA
                           ...the best that money can buy. I
                           just can't believe I've done this
                            o us. All the money wasted that's
                           never coming back.

                                     GEORGE
                           You cut the engines. It would have
                           cost a bundle more to replace a
                           burned-up plane. Not to mention
                           pilot.
               She shakes her head.    No.

                                     AMELIA
                           I overreacted. The plane was too
                           heavy, I should have used the
                           rudder pedal instead of the
                           throttle.
               Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful.
               He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then...

                                     GEORGE

                           out. We always do.

                           going another three years.

                           sales, are going to double.

               A strong smile.    He nods.     We could.

          The whirr and clang of tools. Amelia and George confer with
          one foreman, as George sees something. He touches her arm,
          points in our direction. REVERSE ANGLE as she sees...
          ...Gene has entered the hangar.    Stands by the folding table
          we've seen before.

                    Have fun.

                    Who let you off the hook on this?
          She takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar
          toward Gene. He smiles, unfolds a third chair. As they
          arrive, Amelia steps forward...
          ...kisses Gene on the cheek.    George shakes his hand.

                              GENE
                    Thanks for letting me come.
          As they sit, Gene looks from one to the other.

                              GENE (CONT'D)
                    I guess I'm already outvoted.

                              GEORGE
                    She'd outvote you all by herself.
                     he does it to me every day.
          Gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.

                              AMELIA
                    I don't have a choice. I have to
                    reverse my route and fly east. If
                      go west now, I'm risking
                    hurricanes in the Caribbean and
                    monsoons in Africa...

                         a movie star. Nope, it's navigator
                         Fred Noonan, who will be Amelia's
                         sole companion on the exotic
                         odyssey...
               CLOSE on the rugged smile.

                         Hey, where does a guy go to apply

               EXT. BEACH, MIAMI - DUSK

               The pastel sky has darkened along the row of legendary
               hotels. At first, we can barely find them at the water's
               edge. CLOSE to see her sitting where the surf can't quite
               reach her toes. He's lying back, hands cradling his head.
               Watching the stars come out. Nothing said. Then...

                            been in. You made that happen.
               She looks down to his easy smile.

                                      GEORGE
                            Hate to think where you'd be
                            without me.
               She smiles back.       Tenderness we don't always see.

                                      AMELIA
                            I'll try to make you proud.

                                      GEORGE
                            You did that long, long ago. Only

               A

                                      AMELIA
                            And then what?

                            Then the best part.    The future.
               She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him.
                                        AMELIA (a whisper)
                            Oh yeh.    That.
               She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep.
               Longing. Her body sinks into him.
               LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other.

               LONG ANGLE. From the open door of a hangar we see Amelia and
               George facing reporters in front of the idling Electra. She
               sits on the wing, he's just beneath her.

                                       GEORGE (V.O.)
                            The radio problems crept up on us
                             ver time.

               SUPERIMPOSE:      MIAMI AIRPORT.   JUNE 1.

                                      GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                            The marine 500 kilocycle radio was
                            left in Oakland. Amelia said she

                               GEORGE(cont'd)
                     and Fred were both amateurs at
                     Morse Code, so the radio wasn't
                     worth what it weighed.
          Amelia has made the boys laugh.    George laughs with them.

                                GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     The 250 foot trailing auxiliary
                     antenna, she would leave behind
                     in Miami. Too heavy, not
                     important.
          FLASHES now. And plenty of them. She reaches down to take
          George's hand and HOPS down from the wing. More FLASHES...

                               GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Then, suddenly our remaining radio
                      ouldn't reach its designated
                     frequencies. Pan Am hurriedly
                     replaced the main antennae. And we
                     thought all was well.
          Amelia and George coming toward us now, hand in hand, leaving
          the press behind. Into...
          The hangar. In shadow here.     The world far away, she takes
          his hands. A silence.

                               GEORGE (CONT'D)
                     Race you to California. I'll go
                     west. Five bucks?

                               AMELIA
                     If you'll fly the plane.   Make it
                     twenty.
          And then...

                               AMELIA (CONT'D)
                     Simpkin keeps many mice at one
                     time. Each under a different
                     teacup.
          Wow.   He's finally going to hear this.

                               GEORGE
                     We're saying he's cruel?

                                 AMELIA
                     No.

                               GEORGE
                     Controlling?

                                 AMELIA

          Ah.   The light begins to dawn.

                               AMELIA (CONT'D)
                     He needs the illusion of activity
                      o feel comfortable. That he's
                     preparing for all contingencies.
          George has to grin.

                                AMELIA (CONT'D)
                     That he has more irons in the

                     F
                       ire than anyone knows.

                               GEORGE
                     Especially the mice.

                               AMELIA
                     Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks
                     it's all about her.
          Staring at each other.

                               GEORGE
                     And one of them.    Is right.
                                  AMELIA (a murmur)
                     She knows.
          And then...

                                 GEORGE
                         want you to give me something.
          He's never sounded quite like this before.

                               GEORGE (CONT'D)
                     Tell me this is your last flight.
          Her eyes flicker.     Look down.   A whispered...

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                     Promise.
          And when the eyes come up.

                               AMELIA
                     Don't you know I couldn't? Even if
                     part of me wanted to. Very, very
                     much.
          The look holds.

                               AMELIA (CONT'D)
                     How can we be anything. But what
                     we are?

          

                                                                        107.

          

          

          
               There is no answer.    She leans up into a slow kiss.

                                    AMELIA (CONT'D)
                          I do love you.
               Something in her serious face makes him smile.

                                    GEORGE
                          Well, I love you back.

                                     AMELIA
                          Thanks.
               Takes a step back toward the hangar door. One hand slightly
               up, stay here. Then, the smile he's waited for.

                                     AMELIA (CONT'D)
                          See ya.
               He smiles back. She turns and heads out toward the idling
               plane. She seems small, even fragile, alone on the tarmac.
               STAY with George.    Watching her go.

               The buildings have thatched roofs.    There are oxcarts by the

               A wrenching battle, plane versus monsoon. The storm is
               heavier, deafening, actually STRIPPING PAINT from the

               Amelia beyond exhaustion, but focused, fighting it.      We think
               she's flying alone. Until...
               ...Fred drops into the seat beside her. No words as he
               watches her struggle. Our plane is all over the sky. The
               DIN is ungodly.

               Amelia flying down through heavy turbulence, though it is no
               longer raining. Her features tense. We see the accumulated
               strain of the adventure.

                red appears from the catwalk, slips into the seat beside

               And with cold-blooded nerve, she SWOOPS down, down, THROUGH
               the flock of eagles, scattering them as we arc in for a

               A fountain in an ornate courtyard. There is a RECEPTION, as
               every evening for Amelia, attended by local DIGNITARIES.
               Fred, already a little drunk, leads Amelia to a massive teak-
               wood table. He breaks off the corner of a cracker, sets it
               down in the center of the table.

                is a wiry Scot. He nods respectfully.

                           Ready, Mum.
                He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to
                press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no
                move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't
                understand.

                           outside. In the rain.

                He puts on his slicker.   OPENS an umbrella.    Leaves.
                She looks back to the radio.   FLIPS the switch.

                            You should be sleeping.
                He smiles to keep his voice up. The eyes aren't smiling.       We
                INTERCUT their conversation throughout...

                            I'm running a big adventure here,
                             'm a very important fellow.

                            You told me I was the star.   And
                            you were no one at all.

                     head-wind speed versus fuel as we
                     speak.
          CLOSE on his face.

                     you?

                     So what's that I hear in     your
                     voice?
          A beat.

                               GEORGE
                     Is he drinking?
                               AMELIA (soft)
                     I can handle it.

                               GEORGE
                     Call it off. Right now.      I mean
                     it.

                               AMELIA
                     I can handle it.
          And then...

                               AMELIA
                     I love you.
          Silence.

                               GEORGE
                     After the Fourth.     We're going
                     home.

                               AMELIA
                     Where's that?

                                GEORGE
                     For me?   Anywhere you are.
          She begins to cry. Both hands fly to her mouth and she looks
          away. She swallows hard.

                               AMELIA
                     I'm going to like it there.

                And then...

                                      AMELIA (CONT'D)
                            I'd better. Since this is my last
                            flight.
                A long silence.

                                        GEORGE
                            Well.    If you insist.
                She nods.   She does.

                                       AMELIA
                             t's late here. Guess I'll go
                            curl up under a teacup.

                                      GEORGE
                            I'll go tell the world you're on
                            your way.
                Neither wants to let go.      We feel it so strong.
                                      GEORGE (a whisper)
                            Sweet dreams.
                A beat.
                                        AMELIA (whispers back)
                            See ya.
                And he's gone.      She stares at the radio.

                FLICKER of a kerosene lamp.      Amelia writing at a tiny desk.
                Thinks now. Thinks.

                A sober, contrite Fred comes down the runway in early light.
                As he reaches the Electra, he sees a pile of discarded
                OBJECTS on the tarmac...
                ...metal containers, carton of oranges, parachutes.
                Bedrolls, cold weather gear. Souvenirs from their stops:
                flags, a metal plaque, native crafts, a Welcome Miss Amelia
                Earhart banner. As he studies the pile...
                ...a COFFEE POT comes FLYING out of the plane to roll at his
                feet. Suddenly, a 10 pound coffee tin SAILS PAST, as he
                DUCKS. Amelia appears at the hatch, sees him.

                             might be easier to just shoot me.
                She stares at him for a moment.       A subdued voice...

                                       AMELIA
                             Traveling light, that's all.
                She sits on the lip of the hatch.       Her legs dangling.   Her
                eyes down.

                                       FRED
                             Got room for 190 pounds of asshole?
                No answer.       She's still looking down.   He's never seen her
                like this.

                                       FRED (CONT'D)

                             Everything is.
                He doesn't understand, but he's glad to be forgiven. She
                takes a LETTER from her pocket. Runs her finger over the
                envelope.

                                       FRED
                             I can run into town before we go.
                              et that in the post for you.
                She shakes her head slowly.

                                       AMELIA
                             It's for my husband. I'm going to
                             hand it to him. So I can watch his
                             face as he reads it.

                A RUNWAY that ends in a drop-off at the waters of Huon Gulf.
                The Electra, engines REVVING. Ready to go for it. Our ANGLE
                CLOSES on the belly of the plane. The ANTENNA MAST
                supporting a trailing WIRE ANTENNA.

                             Ten A.M., Friday July 2. They
                             lined up on the thousand-yard
                             runway. One thousand gallons of
                             fuel, enough for 20 to 21 hours of
                             flying.
                LONG ANGLE. Crew and onlookers watch as the plane STARTS its
                run, gathering speed, BOUNCING over uneven ground...
                CLOSE now on the jouncing undercarriage, a momentary PUFF of
                DUST, and as the plane moves PAST, we may notice that the
                belly antenna mast seems to be GONE.
                DOWN the runway it RUMBLES, still earthbound, only 200 yards
                to go. Then 100. Then FIFTY, then at the water's edge, the
                Electra RISES and...

                .
                 ..DROPS out of sight below the land, as we SMASH CUT to...
                ANGLE. The Electra has FALLEN to SIX FEET above the surface
                of the Gulf. The engines THROB at max, the propellers
                THROWING SPRAY. The overloaded plane...
                ...RISING.    Slowly, then faster, then...
                ...SOARING free.

                           Mr. Bellarts. When did she say she
                           was low on fuel?
                All eyes shift to Tommy.    He scans the log.    Stares.

                The tiny room we've come to know. It is filled with people
                who stand motionless, staring somberly at one man. In turn,
                he stares at a telephone...
                Which RINGS. Mary reaches, but his hand goes UP and she
                pulls back. He lets it ring three times, four, gathering
                himself. Lifting it...

                           Yes.
                There are no other words.    His eyes tear up.    He nods numbly
                at the phone.        G

                           Looking back, the questions were
                           obvious. Why would anyone try to
                            ind such a tiny target in a vast
                           ocean, with barely an hour's lee-
                           way in fuel?
                He draws a breath.
                                     GEORGE (into phone)
                           Well, we're most grateful. With
                           such an effort, of course they'll
                            e found.

                           So I tortured myself. Why hadn't
                             killed this plan on day one?
                           And then I realized...

                Alone.   In a moonlit garden.

                                     GEORGE (V.O.)
                           If I tried to count the insane and
                           reckless chances she took from the
                           first moment I met her. I wouldn't
                           know where to begin.
                Slowly to his knees.   By the plants they had tended together.

                                     GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           It was the most tragic of endings.
                           The most cruel and senseless and
                           wasteful. And yet...
                And yet.

                                     GEORGE (CONT'D)
                           It's hard to imagine another.

                We POINT toward the water.

                           I want to be married to you. The
                           way you've been married to me.
                It begins to draw CLOSER.

                           As you read this. I am watching
                           your face.

          And CLOSER.

                    I am hoping to see. That you know
                    how much I mean each word.

                    so very long...

                    Look up. They're in my eyes.

          SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
          Hold.
