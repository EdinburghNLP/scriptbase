</b><b>1    INT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              1    
</b>
<b>     JANUARY 1962. MONTAGE                                              
</b>
     A nice girls' school in a south west London suburb. We see         
     girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962:        
     walking with books on their heads, practising their                
     handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with          
     each other.                                                        

<b>1A   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          1A    
</b>
     In one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive,              
     bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group
     of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be
     daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their
     fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who           
     looks five years younger than everyone else in the class,
     write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY,
     beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit
     in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's
     smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these
     lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her        
     hand - the only one in the class to do so.                         

<b>                         MISS STUBBS                                    
</b>                   (mock-sighing)                                       
               Jenny. Again.                                            

<b>                         JENNY                                          
</b>               Isn't it because Mr Rochester's                          
               blind?                                                   


<b>2    INT. BEDROOM. DAY                                             2    
</b>
     Jenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy
     bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the
     wall.

     Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin
     primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side
     of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us.

     She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on
     the floor near a cheap record player - they're all
     classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco
     record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins,
     she sings along.

     Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath
     her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.

<b>                         MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>               I don't want to hear any French
               singing. French singing wasn't on
               the syllabus, last time I looked.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          2.
</b>


    Jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns
    the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her
    head right next to the Dansette to hear it.

    Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with
    the almost inaudible track.


<b>3   INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY                                         3
</b>
    Jenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch.
    Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother        
    is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle-
    aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the
    colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're
    listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the
    lunch table.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              I've got an English essay to do
              by tomorrow morning.

<b>                        JACK
</b>              I don't want to hear anything
              through the ceiling this
              afternoon, apart from the sound
              of sweat dripping onto textbooks.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>              Cello?

<b>                          JACK
</b>              No cello.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              I thought we agreed that cello
              was my interest or hobby?

<b>                        JACK
</b>              It's already your interest or
              hobby. When they ask you "What's
              your interest or hobby?" at your
              Oxford interview, you can say,
              "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie.
              You don't need to practise a
              hobby. A hobby is a hobby.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              Or interest.

<b>                        JACK
</b>                  (ignoring her)
              You don't need to be good at it.
              You just have to be interested in
              it.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          3.
</b>


<b>                        JENNY
</b>              Can I stop going to the youth
              orchestra, then?

<b>                        JACK
</b>              No. The orchestra shows you're a
              joiner-inner. Universities like
              joiner-inners.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined
              in. So now I can stop.

<b>                        JACK
</b>              Well, if you stop, that shows the
              opposite, doesn't it? That shows
              you're a rebel. They don't want
              that at Oxford.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              No. They don't want people who
              think for themselves.

<b>                        JACK
</b>                  (missing the sarcasm, as
                   is his wont)
              Course they don't.


<b>4   INT. SCHOOL HALL. DAY                                         4    
</b>
    Jenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is
    getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving.
    Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice-
    looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two
    13 year old boys sitting between them wave too,
    parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's
    embarrassment and Jenny's fury.

    The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly
    one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of
    them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the
    frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart
    tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are
    scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.


<b>5   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              5    
</b>
    Jenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his
    bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the
    violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous,
    chronically unconfident and shy.

<b>                        GRAHAM
</b>              Should I wear, you know, Sunday
              best?
<b>
</b><b>                                                            4.
</b>


<b>                        JENNY
</b>              You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to
              show my father you're un jeune
              homme serieux, not a teddy boy.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>              Oh, God.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              It'll be all right. I won't wait.                        
              It's going to bucket down in a                           
              minute. I'll see you at the                              
              weekend.                                                 

    Jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.

<b>                        GRAHAM
</b>              Oh, yes. Bye.

    The two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.

<b>                        SMALLER BOY 1
</b>              Goodbye, darling! See you at the                         
              weekend! I will miss you with all                        
              of my heart!

    Graham blushes. Jenny swipes the chief offender over the
    head with her sheet music.


<b>6   EXT. BUS STOP. DAY                                            6
</b>
    The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A             
    mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and
    a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to
    let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,
    dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the
    car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus
    stop.

    In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the
    foot of one of the children,further slowing down their
    painfully slow progress across the road.

    Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles
    ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates
    for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>              Hello.

    Jenny ignores him.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              Listen. If you've got any sense,
              you wouldn't take a lift from a
              strange man.

    Jenny smiles thinly.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              I am, however, a music lover, and
              I'm worried about your cello. So                         
              what I propose is, you put it in                         
              the car and walk alongside me.

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              How do I know you won't just
              drive off with the cello?

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              Ah. Good point.

    He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that
    have stopped behind him.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              How much does a new cello cost?
              Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't
              know. Let's say thirty.

    He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,
    hands them to her.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              There. Security.

    Jenny laughs and waves the money away.

    Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenny
    is trotting alongside the car, while David leans
    nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while
    driving.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              I'm David, by the way.

    She says nothing.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              And you are...?

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a

              chic.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              It's a Bristol. Not many of `em
              made.

    Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.

<b>                        DAVID

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              It was a rehearsal. The concert's
              next Thursday.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              What are you playing?

<b>                        JENNY
</b>                  (making a face)
              Elgar.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a
              shame he spent so much time in
              Worcester, don't you? Worcester's
              too near Birmingham. And you can
              hear that in the music. There's a
              horrible Brummy accent in there,
              if you listen hard enough.

    Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to
    be able to make Elgar jokes.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>              Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and                         
              Jews mix very well.

              No. I am. I wasn't...accusing

<b>                        JENNY
</b>              Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I
              sit in the car with my cello?

    David stops the car.

    leather seat. David regards the dripping girl with
    amusement.

     David reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the         
     glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.

<b>                           DAVID

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I'd better not. I'm a bit close

     David lights one for himself.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I suppose cellists must go to a
               lot of concerts.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               We don't go to any concerts. We                          
               don't believe in them.

<b>                         DAVID

<b>                         JENNY

<b>                         JENNY

               Oh, yes. He'd say there's no
               point to them. They're just for
               fun. Apart from school concerts,
               of course, which are no fun at
               all, so we go to those. The
               proper ones don't help you get                         
               on.

<b>                         DAVID

</b>                   (heartfelt)
               Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it
               seems as though that's what all
               this slog is for. If I get to
               University, I'm going to read
               what I want and think about what
               I want and listen to what I want.
               And I'm going to look at
               paintings and go to French films
               and talk to people who know lots
               about lots.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Good for you. Which University?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go
               anywhere?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I studied at what I believe they
               call the University of Life. And
               I didn't get a very good degree
               there.

     Jenny smiles.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               This is me. Thank you.

     She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after
     her for a moment, then drives off.

<b>                    JACK

Jenny looks embarrassed. She knows what's coming.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I'm not sure yet.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Well, when will you be sure? You
          can't let the grass grow under
          your feet, you know. Otherwise
          you'll be at the back of the
          queue.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (deadpan)
          I suppose so. I suppose the
          growing grass would knock you off
          balance, and then you'd fall
          over, and by the time you picked
          yourself up, there'd be a queue.

Her father shoots her a look - is she being cheeky?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I might take a year off.

Jenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll
take all his clothes off.

<b>                      JACK
</b>          What for?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (mumbling)
          I don't know. Maybe do some
          travelling, that sort of thing.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Travelling? What are you, a teddy

it. Beat.

          You know she's going to Oxford,

          can get her Latin up to scratch.

Jenny sighs.

      speak.

      mother and father are on their way out of the door. Jack is
      carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with
      her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of
      them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her
      father and he stumbles outside.

flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more
typically associated with a biochemical attack.

</b>
      Jenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting
      at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping
      cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the
      three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest.
      HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier;
      TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also
      the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a
      scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering
      and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it
      with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking
      pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of
      pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino
      with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her
      disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.

</b>                The whole point about him is that                       
                he doesn't feel.

<b>                          TINA
</b>                We still don't have to like him.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                Camus doesn't want you to like
                him. What he's trying to say is
                that feeling is bourgeois. Being
                engagee is bourgeois. His mother
                dies and he doesn't feel
                anything. He kills this Arab and
                he doesn't feel anything.

<b>                          TINA
</b>                I wouldn't feel anything if my
                mother died. Does that make me an
                existentialist?

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                No. That just makes you a cow.

<b>14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14    
</b>
     Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking.

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                 Well I'm going to be French. I'm
                 going to Paris and I'm going to
                 smoke and listen to Jacques Brel
                 and wear black. And I won't
                 speak. Ever. C'est plus chic,
                 comme...

     She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other
     side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the
     shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a
     packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him
     while the others watch.

<b>                              DAVID
</b>                 Hello.

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                 Hello. Thank you.

<b>                           DAVID
</b>                 How did it go?

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                 Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I
                 didn't mess my bit up, anyway.
                 And no-one got thrown out of the
                 orchestra afterwards.

<b>                           DAVID
</b>                 Always the mark of a cultural
                 triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran
                 into you. What are you doing on
                 Friday?

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                 Going to school.

<b>                           DAVID
</b>                 I meant the evening.

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                     (embarrassed)
                 Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     14.
</b>


<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Because I'm going to listen to                       
          some Schubert in St John's, Smith                    
          Square. My friends Danny and                         
          Helen will be going too, so it
          wouldn't be...I'll tell you what.
          I'll come and pick you up, and if
          your mother and father
          disapprove, then you can have the
          tickets and go with one of them.
          How does that sound?

Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his
eagerness to please seems to convince her.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Thank you. And I'd like you to
          take me. I'd like to go with
          someone who knows when to clap.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I usually watch Danny. He knows
          that sort of thing.

Jenny smiles.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          Seven? And we'll probably go for
          a spot of supper afterwards, if
          you...But if you, if that's
          not...Well, we can always put you
          in a taxi.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (flat disbelief)
          Supper.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          If you want.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          The trouble is, we'll already
          have eaten.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Well. I mean, if you'd like
          supper, then, perhaps on Friday
          you could...not eat?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (embarrassed again)
          Oh. Yes. Of course.

Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of
the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with
their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and
starts to walk on.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     15.

<b>                    TINA
</b>          I'm sorry. I just had the
          strangest dream. I dreamed you
          crossed the road and spoke to a
          handsome man with the most
          beautiful car I've ever seen. And
          then you came back and you didn't
          mention it.

Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently.

<b>                    TINA
</b>          `Oo wazzee?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (light, playful)
          Just a man who's been trying to
          pick me up. We're going to a
          concert on Friday night. And then
          we're having a spot of supper.

<b>                    TINA
</b>              (shrieking)
          A spot of supper?                                    

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          You've heard of supper?

<b>                    HATTIE
</b>          We've heard of it. But we've
          never eaten it.                                      

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Neither of you is interested in
          the concert part, I notice.

<b>                    HATTIE
</b>          No. Of course not.

<b>                    TINA
</b>          Oh my God! I've only just
          realised! That's what's going to
          happen to you, isn't it? Look at
          her! Men are going to pick her up
          in the street and take her out to
          supper!

<b>                    HATTIE
</b>          God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't
          thought of that. Look at her.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Don't be so daft.

<b>                    TINA
</b>          We're trying to attract the
          attention of boys.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          16.

               And she's fighting off men.
               Anyway. You're going to have to
               tell us more than that.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Why?

<b>                         HATTIE
</b>               Because no man's ever   going to
               ask us out to supper.   Not until
               we're ladies, anyway.   You're
               going to have to tell   us
               everything. Otherwise   it's not
               fair.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               There won't be anything to tell.

<b>                         TINA
</b>               Well, make something up, then.


<b>15   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                  15
</b>
     Jenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good,
     but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her
     dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing
     in front of her, shouting.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I won't allow it!

<b>                         JENNY
</b>                   (coolly)
               Fine. He's quite happy for you to
               take me.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                   (uncertainly)
               Right. I will.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Good.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Where is it?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               St John's Smith Square.                                  

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Where's that?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I don't know. I'm sure we could
               find out.

     Marjorie comes into the room.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     17.

</b>          It's in Westminster. Just around                    
          the corner from the Abbey.                          

Jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the
nearest opium den.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          How d'you know that?

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          I had a life before we were
          married, you know.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          He soon put a stop to that.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          There we are.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Where are we?

<b>                    JACK                                      
</b>          Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not                     
          going all the way over there.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          The trouble is, that's where St                     
          John's Smith Square is.                             

<b>                    JACK
</b>          And I've just said. That's where
          I'm not going. There must be
          something on locally. Where's the
          paper?

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Jack, she wants to see someone
          who can play. She doesn't want to
          see Sheila Kirkland scratching
          away. I'll take her.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          And how are you going to get over                   
          there? RAF helicopter?                              

The doorbell rings.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          That's him. Now what?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Oh, bloody hell.

<b>                      MARJORIE

</b><b>                                                     18.

Jenny starts towards the door, and then turns.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>           Oh, and by the way...David's a
           Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch
           yourself.

She   goes to the door.

<b>                      JACK
</b>               (panic-stricken and
                 shouting)
           What's she talking about? I've
           never said anything like that in
           my life! Anyway, it's just an
           expression! I'm not against the
           Jews!

Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in
his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket,
slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is
brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most
colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly
exotic.

David has obviously heard Jack's last line.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>               (pleasantly)
           I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David                   
           Goldman.                                            

He offers his hand.

<b>                     JACK
</b>           I didn't mean I'm not against
           you... Actually, I did mean that,
           because I'm not, but...

<b>                      JENNY
</b>           Dad!

David's hand is still extended - in his confusion and
embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now,
and shakes it for way too long.

<b>                     JACK
</b>           I'm sorry. What I'm saying is
           that you're not the sort of, of
           person I'd be against, if I were
           the sort of person who was
           against...people. You're not an
           old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and
           this is Marjorie.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     19.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>              (deadpan)
          You didn't tell me you had a
          sister, Jenny.

General confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie
giggles, and then offers her hand.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You're a lucky man, Jack.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          I suppose I am, yes.

They all sit down.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          So. Gosh. (He looks around
          approvingly.) This is lovely.

Marjorie smiles.

<b>                       MARJORIE
</b>          Thank you.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a
          drink?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I'd love one, Jack, but we're
          running a little late. If Jenny's
          ready, perhaps we'll shoot off.

Jenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Ah. Well. Dad's got something to
          tell you.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          No, no, nothing...It was more of
          a question, really. How would you
          get to St John's Smith Square                        
          from here? For future reference?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Oh, it's a pretty straight run,
          really. Up to Hammersmith, take                      
          the A4 through Kensington and                        
          you're there.                                        

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Simple as that.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Simple as that.

Jack smiles broadly.

<b>                     MARJORIE
</b>              (playfully)
          So shall I book some tickets for                     
          something?

<b>                       JACK
</b>                 (still smiling)
          No.

Beat.

          usually in bed by then.

Jenny winces.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I was hoping Jenny would come
          with me afterwards to have a bite
          of supper with my aunt Helen.

Jenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and
Helen have become `Aunt Helen'.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Oh, well, I suppose...

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          How about if I promise to have
          her in by eleven thirty?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Well, it's Friday night. And if
          you're going out to the West
          End...

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.
          See you again.

They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie.
Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it
suavely,leaving her a little flustered.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Have a nice time.

<b>                       JENNY

Jenny and David leave.

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>                It's called after-shave, Jack.
                And it makes a change from
                carbolic soap.

<b>                          JACK
</b>                At least there's no confusion, if
                you smell of carbolic soap.

      Marjorie rolls her eyes.

</b>                Nobody's ever going to get
                confused about you, dear.

      Jenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny             
      suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for          
      her - other adults are milling around outside, and the            
      women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an        
      incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late          
      twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen         
      is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.           
      She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both        
      appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy          
      Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not         
      yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David       
      and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of         
      these two.

                be worth going in, and we could                         
                go off dancing or something.

     Jenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her      
     fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard         
     about her.

     They walk into the hall.                                         


<b>16   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                         16    
</b>
     It's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the                  
     surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled          
     over by Helen.                                                   

<b>                         HELEN                                        
</b>               Look. We can leave our coats                           
               over there. I want to get rid of                       
               this.

     She nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled        
     at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen.      
     Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The         
     girls walk over to another reception table a few yards           
     away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging          
     overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches       
     the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself.
     Helen notices.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I'm so sorry.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>                   (amused)
               That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               It's beautiful. Where did it come
               from?

<b>                         HELEN
</b>               Oh, South Ken somewhere.

     Helen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress,
     apparently wanting to return the compliment.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>                   (nodding at the dress)
               This is...Well, it's good for

<b>                          JENNY

Helen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat
over imperiously.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          We should go shopping together
          one day, if you want.

She takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady.                    

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          That would be nice. But South
          Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher
          pour moi.

They stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny
embarrassed.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          Sorry?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I just said....It was too
          expensive for me.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          No you didn't. You said something
          completely different.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I just...Well, I said it in
          French.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          In French? Why?

Jenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can
see - that Helen is simply very dim.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I don't know.

Jenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell
rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's
surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they
walk.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          Anyway. It's too expensive for
          me, too. We don't have to worry
          about that. If you want something
          in South Ken, get David to take
          you shopping.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Why on earth would he want to
          take me shopping?

     David, Jenny, Danny and Helen in a row in the middle of the
     auditorium, watching the stage and listening to the music.
     Jenny can't concentrate - she's too excited by the occasion
     and the company. Jenny sneaks a glance at Helen, who stares
     straight ahead, unblinking and enigmatic. David is smiling,
     as if he's trying to communicate enjoyment; Danny's eyes
     flicker across the stage - he understands the music, its
     component parts, which musicians are contributing what.
     Jenny takes it all in.

     goers.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I booked a table at Juliette's.                          
               Will that kill the mood, do you
               think?

</b>               Oh, I do hope so.                                        

     The others laugh.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>               I always think I'm going to my
               own funeral when I listen to
               classical music. (Tentatively)
               That was classical, wasn't it?

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               Yes. Very classical. As classical
               as you can get.

     Helen looks pleased.

<b>                          DAVID
</b>               Juliette's it is, then. Heaven
               forbid that we should end the
               evening reflecting on our own
               mortality.

     Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this.

Jenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club,       
eating and talking. She looks about twelve, but she's          
thrilled to be there. We know now that her life can never
be the same again, and there will be no going back to fish-
paste sandwiches with spotty Graham.

<b>                    DAVID                                      
</b>          Have you never heard "Chante
          Francoise Sagan"?

Jenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly
awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - which
she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening.

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          Oh, it's wonderful.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I've only got....Well, I think
          it's just called `Juliette
          Greco'. The one with the eyes on
          the sleeve. I saved up and got my
          French conversation teacher to
          bring it back after Christmas.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          You've got a French conversation
          teacher?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    HELEN

</b>              (ignoring her)
          You must have seen her sing?                         

Jenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she
have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. Who

They sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for
the double-entendre to disappear into the smoke.

<b>                    DAVID

          Jones? A real one?

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          I just have a feeling that the
          pre-Raphaelites are going to take
          off.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I love the pre-Raphaelites.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Yes, of course. Rossetti and
          Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman
          Hunt, so much. He's so garish.

Danny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgirl
than he thought.

     French?

     Jenny hesitates.

</b>               No. I'm sure I could....re-
               arrange. That would be lovely.

     Jenny lets herself quietly into the house. The hallway is
     dark, but she can hear noises from the kitchen. She pokes
     her head round the corner, and sees her mother doing the
     washing-up.

     Jenny has just said.

</b>
     Jenny, Hattie and Tina are    sitting on their desks, waiting
     for the start of a lesson.    Nine or ten classmates are
     scattered around the room,    talking distractedly, but
     Jenny's group is much more    animated: Tina and Hattie are
     leaning forward, listening    to Jenny, their eyes bright.
     They are clearly awestruck    by Jenny's tales of the outside
     world.

<b>                            TINA
</b>                     (to Hattie)
                 I'm not interested in Schubert. I
                 want to know what else was on the
                 programme.

     Laughter.

<b>                           JENNY
</b>                 There was nothing like that. He
                 was the perfect gentleman. He
                 just said he wanted to take me
                 places and show me things.

<b>                           TINA
</b>                 Things plural? Oh my Gawd!

     More laughter. The English teacher, MISS STUBBS, young and
     fresh-faced and lively-looking, enters, and picks up on
     the excitement of Jenny's coterie.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          I knew that in the end `Jane
          Eyre' would work its magic upon
          you. I'm presuming that's what
          you're so animated about.

The students start to sit down at desks in a more
conventional arrangement.

<b>                       JENNY
</b>          Of course.

<b>                     TINA
</b>          `Jane Eyre' and Jenny's new
          boyfriend.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          He's not my "new boyfriend". God.

<b>                    TINA
</b>          It's true. He's more a man-
          friend, isn't he? He's got a
          sports-car, Miss Stubbs.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Ah. A Mr Rochester figure.

<b>                     TINA
</b>          I think he must be as blind as Mr
          Rochester.

Laughter. Jenny pulls a face at her.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Is there no end to your thirst
          for literary understanding,
          Jenny? As you may have noticed,
          I'm attempting to turn the
          subject away from Jenny's lurid
          love-life and towards the matter
          in hand.

She starts to hand out essays.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          And it's quite clear on this
          evidence that most of you know
          much too much about the former,
          and almost nothing about the
          latter. Reluctantly I must
          concede that Jenny is evidently
          an expert on both matters.
          Excellent as always, Jenny.

Miss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk. We can see
that it's marked `A+'.

     We see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking
     towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's
     clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's
     making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher
     walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the
     teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny
     keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then
     breaks into a run.

     Jenny and David are driving along a North Kensington
     street.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               How do you know Danny?

     David is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently
     looking for an address.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Oh, you know. We kept bumping
               into each other, and we became
               pals, and we've ended up doing a
               bit of work together, when it
               suits us.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               What kind of work?

<b>                         DAVID

               Some buying and selling. This and
               that...

     He stops the car.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'll be two seconds.

     He gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he crosses
     the road.

     Outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a
     large West Indian family, mother, father, three or four
     small children and a dog. They are surrounded by what
     appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on
     his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the
     smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the
     family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them
     inside.

     In an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering
     down anxiously.

     Jenny opens the glove compartment where David keeps his
     cigarettes, takes out the packet, removes one for herself,
     offers the packet to David as he gets into the car. He
     lights them both.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm sorry about that.

<b>                         DAVID

               have to live somewhere. And it's
               not as if they can rent off their
               own kind, is it?

     He starts the car and drives off.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I'm not sure I quite understand
               what you do.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               You don't need to. It's too
               boring. All you need to know is
               that I work in property so that I

     space, as David and Jenny push their way through the                 
     crowded auction room. The auctioneer burbles on in the
     background.

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               You nearly missed it.

     Jenny is in awe of rich London in all its finery. The
     auctioneer clears his throat.

     A middle-aged lady, the epitome of the middle-aged
     contemporary Sloane, twin-set, pearls and a lot of      face
     powder, raises her hand.

<b>29   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      29
</b>
     A beautiful, large, airy sitting room in the first-floor
     flat in Bedford Square. The flat is unusually and
     tastefully decorated, opulent and indicative of Bohemian
     good taste. Jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and
     walking around the room enthralled, looking at Danny's
     existing Pre-Raphaelite art collection; he has three or
     four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls. Danny
     is talking her through them while Helen and David, sitting
     on the sofa, watch - David proudly, Helen impassively.

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               A couple of years ago you could
               pick these up for fifty quid, you
               know. Nobody was interested.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Really? Fifty pounds? I don't
               believe you.

     Suddenly Jenny sees a cello in the corner of the room - a
     good one.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               That's not a Lockey-Hill!

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               There aren't many people who come
               in here and say that.

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          I used to. I vowed to myself that
          one day I'd own one of these. And
          now I own one and never touch it.
          It's vulgar to put it on show,
          really.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          Give it to Jenny.

<b>                    DANNY

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Oh, David. You've never heard me.

Danny stands up and stretches.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I shall come to hear you in St

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          We should all go and spend a
          weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters,
          punting, cream teas, antiquarian
          bookshops. Bit of business, if we
          can find it. What about next
          weekend?

<b>                    DAVID/HELEN

They all look at her.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I'll find a way. I'll talk to
          them.

Jenny   hoots with derision.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>           You're going to ask my father if
           I can go away with you for the
           weekend? He'd have you arrested.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>           We'll see.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>           I'll bet you you can't do it.

<b>                        DAVID
</b>           How much?

<b>                     DANNY
</b>               (amused)
           Be careful, Jenny. You don't know
           who you're dealing with.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>           Half-a-crown.

<b>                        DAVID

They shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on
Danny's mantelpiece.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>           Mon dieu! You must take me back
           to school. And I've got to change
           back into my uniform.

There is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye
contact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic
possibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices.

<b>                     HELEN
</b>           Oh, behave yourselves.

Jenny looks at them all, mystified.

<b>30   INT. CLASSROOM/LATIN. DAY.                                  30    
</b>
     Jenny is in her Latin class, waiting for the lesson to
     begin. Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her
     own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from
     Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, more
     serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The
     teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pulls       
     some papers out of her bag.

<b>                         MRS WILSON

     Jenny puffs out her cheeks. She's not last.

     Jenny winces.

<b>                         MRS WILSON (CONT'D)                           
</b>               52%. That would just about scrape
               a pass in the exam proper. Not
               good enough for Oxford
               candidates.


<b>31   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     31
</b>
     Jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into
     space, clearly upset. On the coffee table in front of them
     is the test, covered in red ink. They hear a key in the
     lock, and they look at each other.

<b>                         MARJORIE
</b>               I'll talk to him.

     Jack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and
     carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then
     notices the essay on the table.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It's her Latin, isn't it?

<b>                         MARJORIE
</b>               The test didn't...Well, it didn't
               go as well as we'd hoped.

     He picks up the paper.
<b>
</b><b>                                    38.
</b>


<b>          JACK
</b>And you still say I shouldn't go
down there and have it out with
whatsername? The Latin teacher?
Because this is hopeless.

<b>          JENNY
</b>How are you going to "have it
out" with her? What are you going
to do? Shout at her until she
decides I'm much cleverer than
she thinks?

<b>          MARJORIE
</b>Everyone's doing their best,
Jack.

<b>          JACK
</b>What if their best isn't good
enough, though, eh? What do we do
then?

<b>          JENNY
</b>We don't go to Oxford. Any of us.
Not even you, Dad.

<b>          JACK
</b>Perhaps it's all a waste of time
and money anyway.

<b>          MARJORIE
</b>You don't mean that.

<b>          JACK
</b>Well, what's she going to do with
an English degree? And if she's
going to spend three years
playing that bloody cello and
talking in French to beatniks,
then I'm throwing good money
after bad. I suppose she might
meet a nice lawyer. But she could
do that at a dinner dance
tomorrow.

<b>          JENNY
</b>Oh, yes. That's the whole point
of an Oxford education. It's the
expensive alternative to a dinner
dance.

<b>          MARJORIE
</b>What about private tuition?

<b>          JACK
</b>Is anyone listening to me? How
much is that going to cost me?
<b>
</b><b>                                              39.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Five shillings an hour. Maybe a
          little more for A-level.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Five bob! But... we could spend
          five bob on this and five bob on
          that, and before we know it
          that's our savings down the
          drain.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          And what else are we spending
          five bob on? What else are we
          spending sixpence on?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Oh, nothing. (He gestures round
          the room.) It's all free. That
          vase was free.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          It was, actually. It was a
          present from Auntie Vi.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          That chair was free. The sofa.
          We don't have to pay for
          anything. And even if we did, we
          don't have to work for it. That's
          the beauty of life, Jenny.
          Everything's free. Grows on
          trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He
          warms to his theme, and grows
          progressively more berserk.)
          We've got a lovely Oxford tree in
          the garden, lucky for you, so
          that's Oxford taken care of. And
          a whole orchard of school trees,
          so that's all free. I'm sure
          there are some private tuition
          trees out there. I'll go and have
          a look.

He stands up.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Jack...

<b>                    JACK
</b>          No, no, won't take me a minute. I
          think I saw some at the back
          there, right next to the pocket
          money tree. I'll just nip out
          and check, see that they're
          doing all right.

</b>

                Don't want anyone climbing over
                the wall and scrumping, do we?
                And you never know. Maybe
                there'll be a man with deep
                pockets growing out there.
                Because God knows we need to find
                you one.

      He leaves the room, apparently to   look in   the garden   for
      the mythical trees.

      tucked into socks.

     even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the             
     coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of

     Jenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary
     propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks
     away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her

     She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father,

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I wasn't going to disturb you. I
          knew you'd have your nose to the
          grindstone.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (incredulous)
          You came to see Mum and Dad?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Is that so hard to imagine?

Jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>          And you're drinking? But it's not
          Christmas!

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Hark at her! Makes us sound as
          though we've signed the pledge.
          You don't know everything about
          us, you know. We had a life
          before you came along.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Yes, that's true. I'm only going
          on what I've seen over the last
          sixteen years.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          I'm trying to think what you
          missed. Nothing much comes to
          mind.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          They can't stand to see me
          enjoying myself.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've
          got a huge pile of Latin
          translation to do.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          You didn't tell me David went to
          Oxford.

Jenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight-
faced.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          No. I didn't.
<b>
</b><b>                                    43.
</b>


<b>          DAVID
</b>For all the good it did me.

<b>          JACK
</b>What did you read?

<b>          DAVID
</b>Oh, English. Just like every
other semi-employed layabout in
London.

<b>          JACK
</b>    (marvelling at the
     coincidence)
English! Which college?

<b>          DAVID
</b>Merton.

<b>          MARJORIE
</b>Isn't that funny?

<b>          JENNY
</b>Extraordinary.

<b>           DAVID
</b>I was just telling Jack that I'm
going back next weekend. I go and
see my old professor every now
and again.

<b>          JACK
</b>That's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track. It's
not always what you know, is it,
David?

<b>          DAVID
</b>Too true. And Clive would love
Jenny. Have you ever come across
Clive Lewis?

<b>          JENNY
</b>Dad has never come across anyone.

<b>          DAVID
</b>I just thought he might know some
of the books.

<b>          JENNY
</b>Dad has never read any books.

<b>          JACK
</b>    (stung)
What's he written?
<b>
</b><b>                                                     44.
</b>


<b>                    DAVID
</b>          He wrote a children's book called
          `The Lion, The Witch and The
          Wardrobe' that did very well, I
          believe.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're
          talking about?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Well, to us he was just the old
          codger who taught Medieval
          literature. But I came to know
          him very well. We just...got
          along, do you know what I mean?

Everyone murmurs their comprehension.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Jenny used to love those books.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Gosh. That dates me. He was
          writing them when I was there.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I'd love to meet him.

There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor.
Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where,
effectively, he is the one being asked.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the
          uptake. Would Jenny like to come
          with me at the weekend?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Well, I don't know about this
          weekend. But one day, yes, thank
          you.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          How often do you see him?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Oh, once every couple of years.
          But next time, eh?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (disappointed)
          Hopefully I'll be there by then.
          So that won't be much use.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          45.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                   (dubiously)
               Well, I suppose...Would she have
               to stay the night?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well, I wouldn't want to drive
               back after one of those Oxford
               dinners.

     Jack chuckles knowingly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Clive will get her a room in
               college. That's easy enough.

<b>                         MARJORIE
</b>               Sounds like too good an
               opportunity to pass up.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>               Please, Daddy. It would be so
               helpful to know something about
               the place.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Would it be a bother to you,
               David?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'd be delighted.

     Jack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam.

               That was scandalous.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I told you. You owe me half-a-

     An ornate four-poster bed occupies most of the space in the
     room. Helen is doing something to Jenny, but we can't see
     what.

</b>
     Jenny is wearing a floaty print dress that she has borrowed
     from Helen, and there are lots of other beautiful clothes
     strewn about the place. Jenny is sitting at the dressing
     table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four
     years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She
     can't believe it. She looks in the mirror, and for a
     moment, she forgets to breathe.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>               There. You'll do. You can keep
               it. I can only wear so many every
               day.

     Jenny emerges from her reverie.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>                   (thrilled)
               Really? Thank you.

<b>                            JENNY
</b>               A nightie?

     Jenny suddenly understands what Helen means.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           47.

<b>                         JENNY

<b>                         HELEN
</b>               Good for you.

               I'm seventeen. On my seventeenth
               birthday, hopefully.

<b>                          HELEN
</b>               With   David?

     Jenny pauses.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Well...Golly. I suppose it will

     transformation. David can't take his eyes off her.

     Helen and Danny, Jenny and David are standing in a quiet,
     old-fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire.

David has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book - `The
Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          So. Now.Is he Clive, do you
          think? Or CS?

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          I'm confused now. I thought you'd

</b>              (attempting, briefly, to
               be patient)
          No, we...Never mind.

David walks over to the nearest table and writes in the
book.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          There.

He stands up, hands the book to Jenny.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (reads)
          "To dear Jenny. With the pleasure
          of meeting you. Come and see me
          again soon. Clive."

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          Dirty old man.

Laughter. He takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. A
group of students enter, all carrying musical instruments.
They stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares
at them with longing - she wants to be one of them. Helen,
meanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>              (sotto voce)
          Why are university girls so
          strange-looking?

Helen's right. The girls in the group are all bespectacled
and frumpy. The others laugh.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          It's true. And they can't all
          have started off that way, can
          they? Most girls aren't ugly, but
          most girl students are. So there
          must be something about those
          places that, you know, makes you
          fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.

</b>          Well, if you look at it that
          way...I mean, that's proper
          scientific analysis. And you
          can't argue with science.

Helen looks pleased.

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          I'm still not quite clear on what
          you want to do when you get here.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I want to read English.

</b>          Sorry?

<b>                    HELEN
</b>          You want to read English books?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Oh. Yes. Reading English is just
          another way of saying...

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're
          wasting your breath.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get
          more of a feel for the place.

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          Absolutely. This would be a good
          place to do a little business.

David catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by
"getting a feel for the place."

<b>                    DANNY
</b>          All those little old ladies
          wandering around...I'll bet this

</b>          Please explain what stats are.
          You're always going on about
          them.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          All right. Think of a number. Now                 
          think about the most boring                       
          lesson you've ever had at school.

               Now double it. Done? Doubled? Now                      
               multiply it by the number you                          
               first thought of, and there you                        
               are. That's the official boredom

<b>46   INT. B &amp; B BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  46
</b>
     A rather grotty and certainly unromantic B&amp;B bedroom - so
     unromantic, in fact, that it even has the same fusty
     curtains from Jenny's sitting room. David is in bed, his
     hands behind his head, waiting for Jenny. As far as we can
     tell - he's wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly - he's
     in his underwear. The bedroom is lit unromantically by the
     40-watt overhead light. Jenny comes into the room wearing
     one of Helen's nightdresses, a glamorous satiny item quite
     inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings. She
     looks nervous.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               We've got exactly the same
               curtains at home.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Let's not talk about curtains.
               You look beautiful. You really
               are a princess.

     Jenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her
     pause at the edge of the bed.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               There's something you should
               know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a
               virgin. And I want to stay that
               way until I'm seventeen.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I think that's good. I think
               that's right. And for your
               seventeenth birthday I'm going to
               take you to Paris or Rome or
               Florence and make you feel like
               the most beautiful princess in
               the kingdom of love. But we can
               still be romantic, can't we?

<b>                         JENNY

               it doesn't mean...

               what might one day be mine? Just
               a peek?

     His eyes stray to her breasts. Jenny stares at him.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               You just want to see them?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I just want to see them.

     Jenny, flustered and nervous, looks at her nightgown - she
     doesn't know what to do.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Let it fall from your shoulders.

     She does so. He stares.

<b>                            DAVID
</b>               Thank you.

     He sits up, and lovingly lifts the straps back up. He
     smiles at her. Relieved, she smiles back.

               in and the old ladies move out
               and I buy their flats cheap.
               That's what I do. So now you
               know.

     Jenny nods reluctantly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               And if you don't like it, then I
               will understand, and you can go
               back to Twickenham and listen to                       
               the Home Service and do your
               Latin homework. But these
               weekends, and the restaurants and
               the concerts..They don't grow on
               trees.

     Jenny looks at him, startled. Trees again?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Do you understand? Of course you
               do. This is who we are, Jenny.

     He turns to face her and holds out his hand. On Jenny: is
     she in or out? Jenny takes his hand. David pulls her
     towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dance
     with her. Further up the pavement, Helen and Danny watch,
     laughing.

     David pulls up in the Bristol outside Jenny's house, and
     they sit in the dark for a little while.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I suppose you have homework to
               do.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank
               you. I had a nice time.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                   (surprised, despite his
                    speech earlier)
               Really? In spite of the, the
               incident? With the map?

<b>                         JENNY

               misunderstanding.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Exactly. A muddle.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          You have no idea how boring
          everything was before I met you.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I hope that there's something
          more than excitement to our
          relationship.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Excitement's a lot, when you're
          at school and you live in
          Twickenham.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You know what I'm trying to say.
          I want you to like me for who I
          am, not just what I can do for
          you.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          But that is who you are. I've
          never met anyone like you. Action
          is character, our English teacher
          says.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          What does that mean?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I think it means that if we never
          did anything, we wouldn't be
          anybody. And I never did anything
          before I met you. And sometimes I
          think no-one's ever done anything
          in this stupid country, apart
          from you.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          That's a good place to end the
          weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.

<b>                       JENNY
</b>          Thank you.

They look at each other. David is clearly smitten. He moves
towards her. He wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to
frighten her - in the end, Jenny makes it easy for him and
moves towards him. They kiss gently and tenderly.
Flustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and
goes inside while David watches.

     Jenny enters the sitting room with her overnight bag to
     find the radio on, her father reading the paper and her
     mother knitting. When Jenny comes in, Jack beams. He has
     clearly turned some kind of corner.

<b>                         JENNY

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Was he nice to you?

     Jenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book.
     She hands it to her father.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Look inside.

     Jack examines the inscription.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Well I never. Look at this,
               Marjorie.

     He hands it to her. She examines it reverently.

</b>               "Clive"...Lucky girl. What was he

<b>                         JENNY

</b>               And did he show you round?

<b>                         JENNY

               though.

<b>                         MARJORIE

          harder?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Never a dull moment with David,
          is there? If it's not concerts,
          it's famous authors. Bit
          different from that lad you
          brought home for tea, isn't he?

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          David's a lot older than Graham.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Graham could live to be two
          hundred, and he still wouldn't be
          swanning around with famous
          authors. Hasn't got it in him.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          He might become a famous author,
          for all you know.

<b>                     JACK
</b>          Being one isn't the same as
          knowing one, is it? Anyone can be
          one. But if you move in those
          circles...

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          What?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Well, it says something about
          you, doesn't it? It says you're
          going places. It says you're well
          connected. He's an impressive
          young man, that David. I like him
          more and more.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Well, they say opposites attract,
          don't they? I wouldn't have
          thought he was your sort.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          He wasn't. And now he is.

<b>                    MARJORIE

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I feel....I Feel I should do my

She leaves the room. Marjorie watches her go thoughtfully.

     A group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her             
     friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher ,       
     jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.

     They put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then            
     immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching.          
     Seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. From somewhere         
     under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking
     cigarettes and offers them around.

<b>                         HATTIE
</b>               What the hell are those?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Russian Sobranies.

     Hattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette.
     The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all
     grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes,
     and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.

<b>                         HATTIE
</b>               Where did they come from?

<b>                         TINA

               the Savoy, or Claridges, or the

               Who knows, with Jenny?

               No. I never.

<b>                         TINA
</b>               Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

<b>                         JENNY

               Oh, it was....(She changes her

               Merton. English. And he offered
               to show me round.

     Tina makes a bitter face.

     Laughter. Jenny glances off into the distance, and spots a
     portly middle-aged woman heading in their direction.

     They stand up, grind their Sobranies into the mud, kick
     them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. The
     Sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.

                whole place burns down.

      Jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her
      candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparently
      attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the
      lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two
      unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same
      size - clearly books.

</b>                Who'd like a piece?

      In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising
      specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a
      couple of slices which immediately collapse.

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>                Never mind. I'll have one of
                those.

<b>                          JACK
</b>                Come on. Presents.

      Without any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of
      the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                Oh. Thank you. I    needed a new
                one.

      The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer it,
      and immediately the house is energised: it's David.

<b>                          JACK (O.S.)
</b>                Good grief. You won't believe
                this, Jenny. Did you leave
                anything in the shop?

      David enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels
      and flowers he's carrying.

</b>                It's a special day.

He and Jenny exchange a glance. Jack comes in behind him.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          She's a special girl.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello,
          young man.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          This is Graham.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Graham, a pleasure. I'm David.

They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younger.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Makes your dictionary look a bit
          feeble, eh Graham?

Graham looks pained. Marjorie notices.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          And ours too, come to that.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Well, we're not the ones trying
          to impress her.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>          Clearly.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          David, what can I get you to
          drink?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          What's everybody else having?
          What have you got there, Graham?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          I've given him a glass of pop.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (stung)
          I'd better be going I have a
          stack of homework to do.

Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye,       
but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door.            

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          Yes. Well. You can put the pop
          away now. What is there for the
          grown-ups?
<b>
</b><b>                                                     66.

</b>          A glass of something warming?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You know me so well.

Hearty laughter from the two men.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Can I open anything yet?

Marjorie comes back into the room.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          Wait for me.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Before you start on that little
          lot , I have a surprise. Next
          weekend, we're all going to Chez
          Georges to celebrate Jenny's
          birthday.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (flatly)
          Lovely.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Chez Georges is in the Boulevard
          St Germain. In Paris.

Jenny giggles her delight. Jack's smile is a little more
forced.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          How d'you mean, Paris?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          You know the one, Dad.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (panic rising)
          But..We haven't got any French
          money. And I'm not sure...I just
          don't think it would agree with
          me.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Dad!

<b>                    JACK
</b>          They don't like us, the French,
          you know. John Sutton at work
          went once. They were very rude to
          him. I'm not sure I'd like that.

Jenny understands David's ploy perfectly, and the role she
must play. Her eyes fill with tears. Jack notices.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          I don't want to spoil anyone's
          fun, but...It's not for me,
          Europe. We'll go another time.

<b>                     JENNY
</b>               (bitterly)
          You've just said you don't like
          Europe. What's going to change?
          It'll have to be Europe, won't
          it? Because it isn't going to be
          you.

<b>                    MARJORIE
</b>          I can take her.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (genuinely indignant)
          To France? And leave me here on
          my own?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Oh, for God's sake.

Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Listen, I'm really sorry to have
          caused all this to-do. I just
          thought it might be nice. But
          I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle
          Daniel. They can have your
          tickets.

Jack looks at him.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Aunt Helen? The one who went to

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Yes, that's the one.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (relieved)
          Well, there we are.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If
               Aunt Helen's going to be
               there...

<b>                          DAVID
</b>                   (the penny apparently
                    dropping)
               Of course!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I didn't want to put a spoke in
               anyone's wheels. But if you look
               at it from my angle...A bachelor,                        
               taking my daughter off to
               Paris...

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought
               it through properly. I do
               apologise, Jack. Would you prefer
               it if Helen took Jenny on her
               own? I don't mind. I've been to
               Paris before.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No,
               no. If Aunt Helen's going...

     He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David's
     eye and smiles.

     Hattie, Tina and Jenny are sitting on their desks, waiting
     for a lesson to start. Hattie shows Jenny a piece of paper
     which apparently contains some kind of shopping list.

<b>                         TINA
</b>               There are some things you must
               buy for us, and some things you
               only have to buy for us if you're
               a proper, true friend. (She
               points at Hattie, then at
               herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel
               perfume. (She repeats the
               gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel
               lipstick. What have I forgotten?

<b>                         HATTIE
</b>               Those funny cigarettes you were
               smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets
               each.

     A very small girl, twelve or thirteen, comes in to the
     classroom and approaches Jenny.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          69.

<b>                         SMALL GIRL
</b>               Are you the girl going to Paris?

     Tina, Hattie and Jenny stare at her.

<b>                         SMALL GIRL
</b>               Well are you or aren't you?
               Because I'd like some perfume.

     Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and
     essays. She sees the small girl and shoos her out. She then
     approaches Jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear.

<b>                         MISS STUBBS
</b>               Jenny, the headmistress would
               like a word at the end of the
               lesson. I'm afraid that the
               legend of Mr Rochester may have
               travelled further than you
               intended.

     Jenny looks at her, startled and a little sick.

     The office is dark, wood-panelled, foreboding, apparently
     designed to put all visitors ill-at-ease. The headmistress
     would probably choose to be wood-panelled if she could.
     She's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. There is a knock at the
     door. She doesn't look up from her paperwork.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               Come.

     Jenny enters, looking young and frightened.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               Ah. Miss Mellor.

     Jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she
     can muster.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               We're all very excited about your
               forthcoming trip to Paris. Our
               excitement, indeed, knows no
               bounds. Some of us can talk of
               little else.

     Jenny looks at her feet.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               An older man, I understand. A

               There may well have been the odd
               sixth-form girl who has lost an
               important part of herself -
               perhaps the best part - while
               under our supervision. These
               things happen, regrettably. If,
               however, we are made aware of
               this loss, then of course the
               young lady in question would have
               to continue her studies
               elsewhere, if she still has any
               use for `A'-levels. Is that
               clear?

<b>                         JENNY

     Jenny turns round and walks out without saying another
     word.

     David and Jenny in bed, in a dimly lit bedroom. They are
     kissing - David more passionately than Jenny. He is making
     little whimpers of excitement, and Jenny is clearly trying
     hard to hide her nerves. We're acutely aware of her age,
     and of her virginity. Suddenly David breaks off.

</b>               Hold on a second. I've got
               something.

     Rather absurdly, he half-disappears over the side of the
     bed, reaching for something on the floor. He comes back
     with a banana. Jenny stares at him.

               Hooray! I'll order some
               champagne.

     Jenny looks at him with what might, from one angle, be
     construed as fondness.

     Jenny and David are in the middle booth, listening to the

     seamlessly.) Jenny is studying the sleeve. She wants to hug

     The bedroom is simple and romantic - everything the airport

     to being her seventeen-year-old self; somehow her seventeen-

                through illiterate essays by
                Sandra Lovell about her pony. And

          won. And here you are, reading
          all those pony essays. I don't
          know. These last few months, I've
          been to Paris, and to jazz clubs,
          and I've eaten in wonderful
          restaurants, and seen wonderful
          films, heard beautiful music...

<b>                    MISS STUBBS

          filled up with beautiful things,
          books and music and conversation,
          in exactly the same way at
          Cambridge. And I didn't have to
          pay the same sort of price. Are
          you taking precautions, Jenny?

               to end up with pony essays. Or
               housework. And yes, maybe we'll
               go up to Oxford. But if we're all
               going to die the moment we
               graduate, maybe it's what we do
               before that counts.

     cloakroom. The club is a smoky West End club, full of            
     smartly-dressed and dubious-looking men, and young,
     glamorous, dubious-looking women. Jenny and Helen look out

     standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier-
     looking man in a dark suit.

     Danny and David are at the bar, having just finished
     talking to Rachman. Danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes         
     his head.

     They both chuckle. There is a silence for a moment.

     While David and Helen watch, Danny and Jenny dance. Danny's
     a good dancer; Jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more
     comfortable and more expressive, with Danny's help.

</b>               I'm still trying to work out what
               makes good things good. It's

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               The thing is, Jenny, you know,
               without necessarily being able to
               explain why. You've got taste.
               That's not even half the
               battle. That's the whole war.

     Jenny smiles at him with gratitude. There is a sudden
     closeness between them. David is watching them carefully.
     They return to their table.

<b>                         DAVID

     Bristol, but David stops her.

</b>               Wait there.

     He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts
     rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything
     but the thing he's looking for.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               What are you doing?

     He slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed.

</b>               Will you marry me?

     She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's
     face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams
     the door on Jenny after she's got in.

     Jenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets.
     Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others.
     Tina looks at her.

     Suddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes
     in.

      Jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but
      she can't concentrate. Her hair is tied back in a pony-
      tail. She gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of
      the window. We see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street
      at night. She looks back at her desk. It looks even more
      boring than the street. She looks at her scrubbed seventeen-
      year-old face in the mirror - so much younger than the
      Jenny we have seen with David. She makes herself up, and
      she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. In her           
      make-up and her school uniform, she's half-woman, half-
      child. We hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the
      radio, the washing-up, occasional muffled conversation.
      Jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.

      Jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and
      listening to the radio. They have their backs to the door.
      Jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment

                but nothing that will require too
                much work. Just leave them in
                your potting shed for a couple of
                weeks, and they'll look after

      Jack and Marjorie turn around and stare at this strange
      apparition wearing too much make-up and a school uniform.

</b>          Do you have any choice? Or is it

She looks at her daughter knowingly. Jack merely looks
confused.

     English. Miss Stubbs is standing at the front   of the class,
     holding a copy of King Lear, and listening as   various
     members of the class massacre the text. Some    are messing
     about by overacting; others read to the best     of their
     ability, tonelessly and with no understanding   of the words.

Lear himself is being read by Ann, the bespectacled girl      
from the first scene. She's no King Lear, and she's one of
the bad readers.

<b>                    GIRL 1

</b>          Yes, when it says `Sings', it
          means he sings those words.

Girl 1 looks at her blankly.

Miss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger -
Jenny's behaviour now is something new in their
relationship. Jenny stares back at her defiantly. Suddenly
Miss Stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an
engagement ring.

<b>                       MISS STUBBS
</b>          Oh, Jenny.

She is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.

<b>                       JENNY
</b>          What?

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Take it off.

Hattie, who is sitting behind Jenny, notices the ring, too,
for the first time.

<b>                    HATTIE
</b>          Oh my God. Is that really what I
          think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A
<b>          BRIDESMAID!
</b>
There is an excited susurration in the classroom.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          You know there's a school rule
          about jewelry.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Half the girls in this room are
          wearing jewelry.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Yes. But none of it is going to
          ruin their lives.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (coolly)
          We have a difference of opinion
          on that.

Miss Stubbs stares at her. Jenny can only just steel
herself to stare back.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Let's see who's right. Come with
          me.

Jenny doesn't move.

<b>                    MISS STUBBS
</b>          Please don't make me drag you out
          like a child.

Jenny gets to her feet. Teacher and pupil leave the room,
while the rest of the class watches.

<b>83   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                      83
</b>
<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               How far advanced are these
               ridiculous plans? Have you set a
               date? Have you decided on a
               church?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               We won't be getting married in a
               church. David's Jewish.

     The headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware,
               I take it, that the Jews killed
               our Lord?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>                   (beginning to feel less
                    intimidated by her
                    surroundings)
               And you're aware, I suppose, that
               our Lord was Jewish?

     The headmistress snorts scornfully

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               I suppose he told you that. We're
               all very sorry about what
               happened in the War. But there's
               no excuse for that sort of
               malicious and untruthful
               propaganda.

     Jenny smiles to herself.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               Anyway, I can now see that you
               are even more in need of
               responsible advice than I
               realised. Is it true that you
               don't intend to sit for your
               exams? And therefore you won't be
               applying for University?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Yes, that's right.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               What do you think you're doing?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               Nobody has been able to explain
               to me the point of University.
<b>
</b><b>                                                     89.
</b>

          Therefore I don't see the point
          of the exams, either.

<b>                    HEADMISTRESS
</b>          Nobody does anything worth doing
          without a degree.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          And nobody does anything worth
          doing with one, either. No woman,
          anyway.

<b>                    HEADMISTRESS
</b>          So what I do isn't worth doing.
          Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs
          Wilson, or any of us here.

Jenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her
silence as an admission of defeat.

<b>                    HEADMISTRESS
</b>          Because none of us would be here
          without our degrees, you realise
          that, don't you? And yes, of
          course studying is hard, and
          boring, and...

Jenny can't contain herself any longer.

<b>                       JENNY
</b>          Boring!

<b>                       HEADMISTRESS
</b>          I'm sorry?

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Studying is hard and boring.
          Teaching is hard and boring. So
          you're telling me to be bored,
          and then bored, and then finally
          bored again, this time for the
          rest of my life. This whole
          stupid country is bored. There's
          no life in it, or colour in it,
          or fun in it. It's probably just
          as well that the Russians are
          going to drop a nuclear bomb on
          us any day now. So my choice is
          either to do something hard and
          boring, OR to marry my... my Jew,
          and go to Paris and Rome and
          listen to jazz and read and eat
          good food in nice restaurants and
          have fun. It's not enough to
          educate us any more, Mrs Walters.
          You've got to tell us why you're
          doing it.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               Because without formal
               qualifications...

     She grinds to a halt. She has never had to answer this
     question before.

<b>                         HEADMISTRESS
</b>               It doesn't have to be teaching,
               you know. There's the Civil
               Service.

     Jenny stands up.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I don't wish to be impertinent,
               Mrs Walters. But it is an
               argument worth rehearsing. You
               never know. Someone else might
               want to know what the point of it
               all is, one day.

     She leaves the office.

     Jenny is half-walking, half-running, towards the school
     gates. She's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. All
     that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly
     over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. She
     looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger
     girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. Jenny
     doesn't even look round when she goes through the school
     gates.

     Later. Jenny and Marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table.
     Jack is standing over them; he hasn't even taken his coat
     off, or put his briefcase down.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               How d'you mean, left?

     Jenny doesn't answer.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I'm not sitting them.

               that what we tell people is more
               important than anything.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               All that...

     Marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want him
     to.

<b>                         MARJORIE

<b>                         JACK
</b>               No. No need for Jack. She should
               hear it. All that money! Do you
               know how much it's cost me for
               you to go through school and take
               no exams?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               I'm sure David will pay you back.
               Send him a bill. As you said, he
               wouldn't have wanted me if I was
               dim, so he should fork out. Just
               tell me why there's a point in
               sitting my exams, and there's no
               point in me going to University.

     Jack gapes at her. He's floundering.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You know what your trouble is,
               don't you? You're too clever by
               half.

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               In which case I should have left
               school years ago, shouldn't I?
               Ask them for the money back. If
               I'm too clever by half, you
               overpaid by a third.

     Danny, Helen, David and Jenny are in Danny's flat; we have
     just missed The Announcement - there is champagne already

     Helen is bemused by their mirth. Danny watches   David

Something about this depresses Jenny. Marjorie notices.

Now they are both thoughtful. As if on cue, Jack comes into
the sitting room, pulling at his tie, looking apprehensive.
He appears to be wearing Brylcreem. He looks like a little

     Jenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the
     cigarettes that David always keeps there. She finds the
     cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. But she has
     seen something in there, so she opens it again. She takes
     out some letters and papers and starts to look through
     them.

     David has finished his phone call and is walking towards
     the car. He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers,
     sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the
     forecourt.

     It's too late. We see Jenny's stricken face, gleaming in
     someone else's headlights.

</b>               There's been a...Jenny's had a
               bit of a shock.

     Jenny laughs, mirthlessly, then starts to weep.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What's happened?

<b>                         JENNY
</b>               It's another one of David's
               little muddles and
               misunderstandings.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jenny, it's not...

<b>                         JENNY

      Marjorie and Jack look at each other. David swings the car
      around and they drive home in silence; Jenny cries
      constantly, without making a sound.

      The Bristol draws up outside Jenny's house. David jumps out
      of the car and lets Marjorie and Jack out. Jack starts to
      walk towards the house and then stops.

                You can sort this out, can't you,
                David?

      Jenny gets out of the car too.

<b>                           DAVID
</b>                Of course I can. She's just got
                the wrong end of the stick about
                something.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                Go inside, Dad.

      Jenny and David watch Jack and Marjorie go into the house.
      The moment the door is closed, Jenny walks towards David.
      She's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the
      glove compartment. She starts to throw them at him, one by
      one.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and

      When she has thrown the last one, she flies at David - she
      slaps him, punches him, scratches him. David tries to grab
      her hands, but she's too wild.

<b>                          DAVID
</b>                Just let me...

</b>                Legally, yes, but...

      Finally he manages to subdue her. She leans against the
      car, distraught.

David gestures vaguely.

</b>          Where?

<b>                    DAVID

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Byron Avenue! It's no wonder we

Jenny picks one of the envelopes up off the ground and
looks at it.

</b>              (bitterly sarcastic)
          Good grief. It's the truth.

<b>                    DAVID

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Don't be like this.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          I have nothing. I left school. I
          didn't take my exams. Where's it
          all gone, now? I gave my life

</b>          Jenny, I can get a divorce.
          Everything will turn out for   the
          best. You'll see.

We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace
curtains anxiously.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Go and tell them. Go and tell
          them, then go and tell your wife.
          I want to see you. I want to
          stand there and watch.

David stands on the pavement, looking towards the house. He
looks away; he can't make eye contact with Jenny's parents.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          They're not going to listen to me
          now. Let me come round tomorrow.

          bit.

          Please don't leave me to tell

          me that much. You owe them that
          much.

          I owe them a lot more than that.
          I owe them everything. They gave
          me you.

He opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny
doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David
takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.

<b>                    JENNY

          out and drag you in.

      Jenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera
      stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes
      another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to
      shake, and he cries and cries.

      Jenny comes in, leaving the door open for David. Her
      parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her
      anxiously. Their coats are still on, and they haven't put
      the lights on yet.

<b>                          JACK
</b>                What's going on?

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                He's helping himself to some
                Dutch courage before facing you.
                Stolen Dutch courage, from the
                look of it. He has something to
                tell you.

      She stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her
      parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights.
      Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the
      street.

<b>                          JACK
</b>                He just drove off.

      We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd
      drive off!

<b>                          JACK
</b>                    (pathetic)
                Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?

      Jenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He
      already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should
      hug. But they don't.

</b>
      A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far
      from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -
      she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young
      again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't
      bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.

      She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,
      steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the
      door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She
      is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.
      But there's more to come.

</b><b>                                                    105.

The woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into
the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David
has found time to father another baby.

<b>                       WIFE
</b>          Oh. Hello.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>              (almost inaudible)
          Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must
          have the wrong house.

The woman stares at her.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Yes. I wanted number...It's my
          cello lesson. Silly. I...

She dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.

<b>                    WIFE
</b>          Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.
          You're a child.

Jenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up
the driveway, but the woman won't let her go.

<b>                    WIFE
</b>          No. No. You stay here. If you're
          old enough to sleep with him,
          you're old enough to look at me.

<b>                       JENNY
</b>          I can't.

But she doesn't move, either.

<b>                    WIFE
</b>          You didn't know about any of
          this. Presumably.

Jenny shakes her head.

<b>                    WIFE
</b>          No. They never do. Did he ask you
          to marry him?

Jenny nods.

<b>                    WIFE
</b>          Yes. Of course he did. You're not
          in the family way, are you?
          Because that's happened before.

Jenny shakes her head.

<b>                          WIFE

                can escape intact. (Beat)
                Relatively speaking. Not all of
                them have done.

      She nods at the children.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>                That's why he never goes through
                with anything. He does love them.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                    (looking into the pram)
                She's beautiful.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>                Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's
                four months old.

      Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself
      from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                Four months!

<b>                          WIFE
</b>                Yes. Babies often are that sort
                of age. Perhaps you can remember
                a night four months ago when he
                seemed a little distracted.
                Anyway. If you'll excuse us.

      She pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the
      path.

      Marjorie and Jack are in the kitchen. Marjorie is sipping
      tea, shoulders hunched, defeated. Jack is pacing around the

      Close-up of the floaty print dress that Helen gave her. The
      dress is suddenly jerked out of shot, and we pull back to

      Jack is almost in tears.

</b>                There's a cup of tea for you
                here.

      No answer. He puts the tea on the floor, and sits down next
      to it.

</b>                I know I made a mess of

</b>                All my life I've been scared, and
                I didn't want you to be scared.
                That's why I wanted you to go to
                Oxford. So that if someone asked
                you out to a nice restaurant, you
                wouldn't panic about what was a
                starter and what was a main
                course. And then David came
                along, and he had money, and he
                knew famous writers, and he knew
                how to get to classical music                              
                concerts. But he wasn't who he                             
                said he was. He wasn't who you
                said he was, either.

      Jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it
      completes a circle. She's back where she started from, or
      would like to be, anyway. If she seems older than she did
      when we first met her, it's because things have happened to
      her, and they've left a mark on her face. She's worried and
      tired. The headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her
      return - but only because of the opportunities for smugness
      and schadenfreude it provides.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                So. Your Jewish friend turned out
                to be married already, I
                understand. How unfortunate.

      Jenny doesn't say anything. She has clearly decided to
      swallow anything she has to.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                Anyway. How do you think we can
                help?

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                I'd like to repeat my last year
                at school. Start all over again.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                I got the impression the last
                time we spoke that you didn't see
                the point of school. Or of me, or
                of any of us here.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                I know. I was stupid.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                I know that I need to go to

                Some other chap? There won't be
                any other chaps. Not for a long,
                long time, anyway.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                I'm afraid I think you're the
                sort of young lady who attracts
                chaps whether she wants to or
                not. No,I think the offer of a
                place at this school would be
                wasted on you. You showed how
                little you valued us only weeks
                ago. And I must confess that it
                gives me a sort of grim
                satisfaction to return the
                sentiment now.

                Is it really so grim, your
                satisfaction?

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                It gives me no pleasure to see
                our schoolgirls throw their lives
                away. Although, of course, you're
                not one of our schoolgirls any
                more. Through your own volition.

<b>                          JENNY
</b>                I suppose you think I'm a ruined
                woman.

<b>                          HEADMISTRESS
</b>                Oh, you're not a woman.

      headmistress is pleased with her final line.

                your help.

<b>                          MISS STUBBS
</b>                I was so hoping that's what you
                were going to say.


<b>116   EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY                                 116
</b>
      Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on        
      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           
      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           
      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,           
      stops, then walks towards her.

<b>                      DAVID
</b>          Jenny.

Jenny says nothing.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell
          you that I am going to ask my
          wife for a divorce.

Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Don't you understand what you've
          done?

David looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he
thought.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I can see my behaviour must have
          been... confusing. But we've
          never sat down and had a proper
          chat about it all. About the whys
          and wherefores. They can wait.
          The important thing is that
          you're still my Minnie Mouse, and
          I love you, and you had fun. You
          know you had fun.

<b>                    JENNY
</b>          Yes. I had fun. But I had fun
          with the wrong person, at all the                    
          wrong times. And I can't ever get
          those times back, now.(Beat)                         
          Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every                    
          day I wake up and pinch myself.
          And when I think how close I                         
          came...                                              

She looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a
dream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,
leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her
to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man
offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David
stares longingly after them.
