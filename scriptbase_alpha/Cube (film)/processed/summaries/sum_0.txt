Six different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms.
Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man.
Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.
