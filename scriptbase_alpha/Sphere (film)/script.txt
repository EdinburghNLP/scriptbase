FADE IN:

EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - DAY

BEGIN TITLES.

MOVING AMONG the hallucinatory variety of creatures --
barbaric, distorted, sublime -- that haunt the ocean floor.
All but unknown to man except in the deep preconscious brain
that houses the family album of the race... Where we remember
that they are us... Then...

                              DISSOLVE TO:

BALLET OF ODD SHAPES

and exotic colors -- like a living abstract painting --
tropical fish moving in the f.g... Aquarium fish -- fish we
know -- fish of the lesser depths, as we RISE UP TOWARD the
surface...

Then nearer the surface still, fish dart and flee before a
distant RUMBLE... that GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER...

HELICOPTER

ERUPTS INTO WATERY VIEW as it blasts across the ocean...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

A tropical morning sun paints its luster on the sea-chop. A
helicopter hurtles across the Pacific Ocean.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

NORMAN GOODMAN, 50s, a day's growth of beard and eyes sandy
with sleep, wakes up.  Adjusts his steel-framed glasses.
Unballs the tweed jacket he's been using as a pillow.  He's
nearly sitting in the lap of the PILOT, 30s, a tightly wound
military type, as they zoom across the waves.

          PILOT
     Good sleep?

          NORMAN
     Not bad. So, where are we?

          PILOT
     Where'd they bring you in from?

          NORMAN
     San Diego.  Left yesterday.

          PILOT
     So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?

          NORMAN
     Yeah.

          PILOT
     Long trip.  What kind of work do you do,
     sir?

          NORMAN
     I'm a psychologist.

          PILOT
     A shrink, huh? Why not. They've called
     in just about everything else.

          NORMAN
     How do you mean?

          PILOT
     We've been ferrying people out of Guam
     for the last two days.  Physicists,
     biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
     Everybody being flown to the middle of
     nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.

          NORMAN
     What's going on?

          PILOT
     They're not telling us anything, sir.
     What about you? What'd they tell you?

          NORMAN
     They told me that there was an airplane
     crash.

          PILOT
     Uh-huh. You get called on crashes?

          NORMAN
     I have been, yes.

          PILOT
     And why is that, sir?

          NORMAN
     I'm on a list of psychologists the F.A.A.
     brings in when a plane goes down.
         (beat)
     So, where exactly are we now?

          PILOT
     Well, I'm not supposed to tell
     you...let's just say we're two hundred
     miles from nowhere, sir.

          NORMAN
     You're not supposed to tell me?

          PILOT
     No, sir.

Norman looks out of the helicopter, at the ocean.

          NORMAN
     Don't you get bored looking at that?

          PILOT
     To tell you the truth, no, sir. I'm real
     happy to see it flat like this.

          NORMAN
     Why?

          PILOT
     Good weather.  It won't hold though.
     There's a cyclone forming up in the
     Admiralties, should swing down this way
     in a few days.

          NORMAN
     What happens then?

          PILOT
     Everybody just clears the hell out.
     Weather can be really tough in this part
     of the world. I was stationed in Florida
     and I've seen a lot of hurricanes, but
     you've never seen anything like a Pacific
     cyclone, sir.

          NORMAN
     You never met my first wife.

          PILOT
     Don't be so sure.
     That's where we're headed, over there.
     Here take a look.

He hands Norman binoculars.

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

A salvage ship surrounding four other, smaller craft in
concentric circles.  A mile long circle of bouys.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

as he absorbs this new information. What's going on?

          NORMAN
     All this for an airplane crash.

          PILOT
     I never mentioned a plane crash.
         (beat)

                              CUT TO:

EXT. SALVAGE SHIP - DAY

The helicopter lands on the salvage ship helipad.  Norman
hesitates at the door. A seaman coaxes him and he jumps down.
Blasted by the downdraft of the rotors, Norman humps his
duffel bag across the deck, hustles after his escort.

                              CUT TO:

INT. SALVAGE SHIP - LATER

Norman follows a SEAMAN, 20s, as he carries Norman's duffel
bag along the narrow corridors belowdecks...

          SEAMAN
     You have any other gear, sir?  Watch your
     step.

          NORMAN
     I'd like to call my family.

          SEAMAN
     We'll get you settled in quarters,
     sir.  You're to remain there until we
     send for you.

          NORMAN
     I want to get started right now.

          SEAMAN
     We'll send for you.

          NORMAN
     It's critical that I see them, because --

          SEAMAN
     See who?

          NORMAN
     The survivors. If I don't get to them
     within the first twenty four hours...

          SEAMAN
     What survivors?

          NORMAN
     The survivors of the plane crash.

          SEAMAN
     Plane crash?

          NORMAN
     Listen carefully.  I deal in post-
     traumatic stress and survivor guilt --
     maybe I should talk to someone who knows
     what's going on.

          SEAMAN
     You can talk to the ship's psychiatrist.

          NORMAN
     I'm a psychologist, that's why I was sent
     down here.

Norman follows the Seaman through a hydraulic door...They
come upon TED FIELDING prowling the corridor.

          TED
         (to Seaman)
     Look, I told you people over an hour ago
     I need a phone.  A phone.

The Seaman brusquely continues past with Norman's duffel
bag.

          SEAMAN
     You'll have to discuss that with
     Mr.Barnes.

          TED
     That's fine...Barnes.  Give me a phone,
     I'll call him.

He recognizes Norman.

          TED (cont'd)
     Norman...what are you doing here?

The Seaman grabs Ted's arm.

          TED
     Would you take your hands off me, please.
     Do you have any idea who I am?

          NORMAN
     He will if you just tell him the name of
     the book you wrote.

          TED
     It's called 'Astrophysics You Can Use'.
     It was a Book of the Month Club Main
     Selection.

The Seaman turns, ramrod-straight, and fixes Ted with a
steely Aryan gaze.

          SEAMAN
     Never heard of it.  Now back in your
     quarters.

          NORMAN
         (to Ted)
     You really thought that he read your
     book...after all these years?  You
     haven't changed.

          TED
     Well, it's written for the layman.

          NORMAN
     He's not impressed.

          TED
     They don't read.
         (to Seaman)
     Is there a phone in here?

The Seaman grabs his arm again.

          TED (cont'd)
     Would you stop doing that!  I can go to
     the room myself.

          NORMAN
     I've been trying to call my wife for the
     last 15 hours.

          SEAMAN
         (sharply to Ted)
     Sir?

Ted backs off toward his room, opens the door.

The Seaman continues on his way with Norman, unlocks a door --
Norman's quarters. Norman glances up the hall...

NORMAN'S POV - BETH HALPERIN

Thirties, a mordant beauty, stands at the threshold of her
room.  Watching him.  A lot going on behind those eyes.  She
and Norman exchange a look.  Then without a word, she returns
to her room.

CLOSEUP - NORMAN

As the Seaman ushers him inside.

          NORMAN
     Beth?

Then the Seaman closes the door on him.

                              CUT TO:

INT. NORMAN'S QUARTERS - LATER

Norman lies on his cot, stares at the ceiling, his tweed
jacket folded up like a pillow beneath his head.

There's a knock at the door and it is opened by HARALD
COTESWORTH BARNES, 40s, an imposing man in dark glasses and
dark dress.

          BARNES
     Goodman!  You been here long?

He shakes Norman's hand.

          NORMAN
     I've been here three hours.

Barnes sweeps him along into the hallway.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Barnes leads Norman along the hallway and down some stairs.

          BARNES
     Welcome aboard.  I don't mind telling
     you, this thing scares the hell out of
     me.

          NORMAN
     It's probably already too late.  You
     might as well put me on a helicopter and
     send me back. Whatever damage was done to
     the survivors, is already done. You know
     what I mean?

          BARNES
     Hold on, we'll get to that.

          NORMAN
     I don't even know who you are.

          BARNES
         (admiring)
     Well, I sure know who you are.

          NORMAN
     Who are you...Navy...military?  What are
     you?

          BARNES
     You ever hear of the O.S.S.A.?

          NORMAN
     Yes.

          BARNES
         (proudly)
     Well, they don't know who I am.  That
     should reassure you.

Barnes takes Norman aside.

          BARNES
     Look, you haven't talked to anybody about
     this, have you?

          NORMAN
     Well, I talked to the helicopter pilot.

          BARNES
     What'd you tell him?

          NORMAN
     What did I tell him. I told him I was
     here to see the plane crash.  That's my
     job.

Barnes chews this over thoughtfully...

          BARNES
     The plane crash.  Good.

          NORMAN
     There was no plane crash?

          BARNES
         (confidentially)
     Spacecraft.

          NORMAN
     Spacecraft?  I guess that explains a lot.
     NASA?

          BARNES
     That doesn't surprise you?

          NORMAN
     Well at least it explains the secrecy.

          BARNES
     The secrecy's critical, Norman.  You made
     that explicit in your report.

          NORMAN
     What report?

          BARNES
     The ULF.

          NORMAN
         (remembering)
     I wrote that for the Bush Administration.

          BARNES
     And that's our Bible here.  Every jot and
     tittle.

          NORMAN
     But that was a report about a possible
     encounter with an alien being.

Norman laughs nervously, looks at Barnes.  Barnes isn't
laughing.  Suddenly Norman isn't laughing either.

          BARNES
     You want to come with me?

          NORMAN
     Oh, boy.

                              CUT TO:

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - LATER

A video image of SEAMEN aboard a telephone-cable ship showing
the sheared fiber optic cable to the camera as Barnes, laser
pointer in hand, delivers a briefing.

          BARNES
     About three weeks ago, a ship laying
     fiber optic cable between Honolulu and
     Sydney hit an obstruction a thousand feet
     underwater.  Cut the cable clean as a
     shears.  The Navy got interested -- sent
     out a search ship.

ANGLE ON BETH

As she watches... SUPERED below:

DR. BETH HALPERIN:  PHYSICIAN/BIOLOGIST

ANGLE ON HIGH-RESOLUTION TV IMAGE

A sonar image of an enormous triangular fin jutting abruptly
from a ridge of coral...

          BARNES
     ... Turns out what did it was this -- We
     took this with the side-looking sonar --
     an aerodynamic fin longer than a football
     field.  Bigger than any known wingspan.

ANGLE ON TED

As he watches.... SUPERED below:

TED FIELDING:  ASTROPHYSICIST

          TED
     You have any idea what it's made of?

          BARNES
     We sent the SCARAB robots to snip a piece
     out of it...

ANGLE ON MICROSCOPE IMAGE

of the composition of the fin...

          BARNES
     It's a titanium alloy in an epoxy/resin
     honeycomb.  It's more sophisticated than
     anything we can duplicate.

          TED
     The Russians don't have anything like
     this?

ANGLE ON SONAR IMAGE

This one composed of fine dots.

          BARNES
     You tell me.  That's the fuselage. Ultra-
     high-res S.L.S. bottom scan, came in a
     week ago.  There it is...buried under
     about eight yards of coral.

          BETH
     There's something wrong with that
     measurement.  Pacific coral grows at a
     rate of an inch a year.  You can set your
     watch by it.

          BARNES
     That's right.

          BETH
     So, you're saying the spacecraft crashed
     in the year...

          HARRY (O.C.)
     1709.

They all turn in the direction of the voice...

REVERSE ANGLE ON HARRY ADAMS

As he watches, bemused, from a chair in the corner, his
fingers forming a steeple.  A black man with a dour manner
and lightning eyes, Oxford shirt and chinos. SUPERED BELOW:

"HARRY ADAMS:  MATHEMATICIAN."

          BETH
     You're saying this spacecraft crashed
     three hundred years ago?

          HARRY
     Two hundred and eighty-eight.

          BETH
     But that's impossible.

          BARNES
     It's not impossible if this spacecraft
     came to earth from an alien civilization.

A long beat of wonderment...

          TED
     You think this is an alien spacecraft?

          HARRY
     You see, it's not impossible. It's
     ridiculous.

          BARNES
     We believe this spacecraft contains an
     unknown life form. That's why you're
     here.  You're the human contact team
     recommended in the Goodman Report.
         (gestures to each)
     We have a biochemist to assess the
     physiology of the Unknown Life Form, we
     have a mathematician, because that'll
     probably be our common language... and we
     have an astrophysicist to locate its
     place in the cosmos.

          HARRY
     Led by a psychologist.

          BARNES
     That's right.

          HARRY
     That's what the little green men say
     nowadays?  'Take me to your therapist'?

Norman bites his tongue.  He's used to it.  Barnes refers to
his copy of The Goodman Report...

          BARNES
         (reading)
     'Contact teams meeting an unknown life
     form, or U.L.F., must be prepared for
     severe psychological impact. Stress
     reaction when confronted by unknown life
     has not been sufficiently studied and
     cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
     But the most likely consequence of
     contact is absolute terror.'
         (beat)
     That's from Norman's report.

          TED
     I'm sorry...are these parameters correct?

          BARNES
     Yup.

          TED
     So, you're saying you have a fuselage
     from a spacecraft over a half-mile long
     that crashed in the ocean three hundred
     years ago, and it's completely intact?

          BARNES
     That's right, and the kicker is, our
     sonar's picking up a low hum.
     Something's still running inside.

A beat as they all look at each other...

          HARRY
     Hold on a second.  There's no way that
     coral could've grown faster than an inch
     a year?

          BETH
     No.

          TED
     Well, that's why we're going down there
     to see, isn't it?

          HARRY
     Who said we're going down there?

          TED
     Are you kidding?  This is the greatest
     scientific discovery since Copernicus!
     Bigger than Copernicus!  The idea that
     we're not alone?  It'll change
     everything. We have physical evidence
     that there's extra terrestrial life.  You
     don't want to see that?

          HARRY
     This is not an equation that needs to be
     solved. No.

          NORMAN
     Harry's got a point. I'm not too sure
     about this idea of going down a thousand
     feet either.

          BARNES
     How deep have you been, Norman?

          NORMAN
     I can snorkle ten to fifteen feet.

          BARNES
     Good.  You do that, and I'll take care of
     the rest.

          HARRY
     I have got to say, I resent this briefing
     very much.

          TED
     Oh, Jesus!

          BARNES
     Why is that, Harry?

          HARRY
     Did you decide you have to break the news
     to us gently?

          BARNES
     What news?

          HARRY
     About the door.

          BARNES
     Harry, we have divers cutting through
     excavation trenches as we speak,
     searching for that door.

          HARRY
     You know exactly where the door is, am I
     right.  Am I right?

          BARNES
     You're right.

          HARRY
     One other thing. If Norman's report calls
     for a biologist, a mathematician, an
     astrophysicist, and a psychologist...
     then why are you here?

    Barnes grins enigmatically.

          BARNES
     I'm not here.
         (he turns)
     Physical protocols begin in half an hour.

He leaves.

          HARRY
     He's not here.  What the hell does that
     mean?

          NORMAN
     Harry, I'm impressed.  You knew he
     wasn't telling the truth about the door.
     How did you know that?

          HARRY
     Oh, there's lots of things he's not
     telling us about.  He's not telling us
     any of the important things.

          TED
     Like what?

          HARRY
     You wouldn't believe it if I told
     you...but you'd probably publish it.

NORMAN AGAINST A WHITE BACKGROUND.

          MEDIC (O/C)
     Do you wear glasses all the time?

TED AGAINST A WHITE BACKGROUND.

          TED
     ...Why? Are the glasses a problem?
     Because I don't actually need them.
     Clinically speaking they're just for
     reading.  They're more of a crutch
     really.
         (takes off glasses)
     I see fine without them.

     Could you read the fifth line please.

     Sure.

NORMAN AGAINST A WHITE BACKGROUND.

          NORMAN
     They said there was no problem, but they
     didn't anticipate that I would be going a
     thousand feet under the water.  I find it
     interesting that a part of me wants to

          NORMAN
     Going down a thousand feet under the

INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

Norman struggles to stay awake as a DIVE INSTRUCTOR
drones.

          DIVE INSTRUCTOR
     Let me remind you of a few points. This
     will be a saturation dive. You're going
     to be taken to a Habitat at a thousand
     feet. We have an atmosphere of 21% OT and
     79% Nitrogen, which means that the PO2
     would be .21 and .79.  In this case we
     will be compressing on HE.

ANGLE ON HARRY, TED, BETH AND NORMAN as the Dive Instructor
continues.

          DIVE INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)
     Compression to a thousand feet will then
     occur, using pure helium. As you
     compress, you will experience a warming
     of the environment and you can also
     expect to experience High Pressure
     Nervous Syndrome.  HPNS is manifested by
     trembling, feelings of confusion,
     disorientation and possible
     nausea.

          NORMAN
     I got that now.

The Dive Instructor drones on.

          DIVE INSTRUCTOR
     These symptoms should subside after a
     short time on the bottom.
     You will also notice marked voice change
     as the PPHE increases.

EXT. SUBMARINE - CLOSE ON NORMAN - DAY

Peering up through the dome of the submarine as it drops away
from the mother ship and descends...

                              CUT TO:

INT. SUBMARINE - LATER

Norman takes a seat inside the cramped sub.

          NORMAN
     Sit anywhere?

The rest of the team sits, knee-to-knee.  Ted sweats
profusely.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Everybody happy?

Barnes sits alongside a PILOT in the sub's cockpit, separated
by a wall of Plexiglas.

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     The descent will take about thirteen
     minutes descending at a rate of eighty-
     feet per minute.  It'll get a little
     chilly.  Try and relax.

The sub rocks a little.

          NORMAN
     Next time, just tell us when you're going
     to push the button.

Barnes flips a switch and a MOZART HORN CONCERTO BLARES
cheerily on the PUBLIC ADDRESS... Harry ties his shoes.

          HARRY
     Mozart.  Horn Concerto in E Flat. K-447.

          BETH
     I'm surprised to see you here, Harry.

          HARRY
     Everybody went down but Harry -- written
     down in some secret government file
     somewhere.

Harry turns to Ted, shivering in a cold sweat of nerves...

          HARRY
     How you holding up there, Captain
     Nautical?

          TED
     I'm loose.

          HARRY
     You're loose?

          TED
     I'm loose.  I'm loose.

Then the sub lurches suddenly...

          TED
     I'm a little uptight...What was that?

The sub rocks again.

          NORMAN
     Are we okay?  Why don't I have a
     seatbelt?

Barnes' VOICE INTERRUPTS the MOZART.

          BARNES
     Oh, shit!

          BETH
     Shit?

          TED
     What was that?

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     We had a little flame out. But don't
     worry, we'll ride this current until we
     get power back.

          TED
     Did he just say we lost power?

The group contemplates this as the Mozart cheerily resumes.

          NORMAN
     Flame out?  What's a flame out?

          BARNES
     Don't worry about it.  We're in the river
     now.

          NORMAN
     What river?

          BARNES
     It's a temperature salinity differential
     that flows like a river inside the ocean.

          NORMAN
     We're in the middle of the ocean under
     the ocean and there's a river?

          BARNES
     That's right.

          NORMAN
     You couldn't tell us that when you de-
     briefed us?

          BARNES
     Need to know.

          BETH
     It's a good thing, Norman.

          NORMAN
     It just, you know...lessens the stress
     response -- the more you know in front.

Ted is looking very tense.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     You okay, Ted?

          TED
     No, I'm not okay.

          NORMAN
     Look at me.

Beth tries to soothe Ted. He gets more tense.

          NORMAN (CONT'D)
     Maybe you shouldn't touch him, Beth.
         (to Ted)
     Just look at me.  I want you to breathe.
     Just look at me.  You want to take a
     breath.  On the count of three...one...

Ted breathes.  Harry begins to hum.

          TED
     You're not breathing either, Norman.

          NORMAN
     I know I'm not breathing.  We're going to
     breathe together, okay? We're both
     nervous, yes?  Breathe in through your
     nose...one, two, three and out.  It's
     just a stress response.  Out.

          BETH
     You're not giving birth here, Ted.

          NORMAN
     In and out...two...three...four...

Ted and Norman exchange a smile.  Harry's humming gets
louder.

          TED
     Would you cut that out please, Harry?

          NORMAN
         (to Ted)
     You're having a stress reaction.  That's
     Harry's stress reaction, okay?  A bunch
     of adolescents here.

Beth is holding onto Ted's hand.

          BETH
     Okay, man?

She lets go of his hand.

          TED
     Thank you, that's better. I'm better.

He laughs with relief.

The sub continues to descend.

          NORMAN
     Those noises we're hearing, that's
     normal?

          BARNES
     Those noises are the pressure of the
     water attacking the integrity of the sub.

          BETH
     You know a little something about that,
     don't you? Norman? How the pressure can
     attack your integrity?

          NORMAN
     Come on...be nice this trip.

          BETH
     Were you nice last time?

          TED
     You two want to sit together?

Norman wipes sweat off his brow.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN - LATER

The sub descends into the gloom... Not much light down
here... In the distance, the shadowy monolith of the tail fin
looms, like some ancient misplaced totem.

INT. SUB - LATER

Ted peers out of the porthole.  Then his jaw drops.

Ted gestures to Norman, and Norman joins him. Peers out...

Emerging INTO VIEW from behind a ridge...

THE HABITAT

A visually breathtaking network of cylinders and domes, in
yellow steel and glass, lit up from inside and out -- like a
vast underwater sculpture -- as fish dart around it...

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     That's the habitat.

The team are squeezed face-to-face in a cold steel-walled

Then a scary HISSING sound as GAS under pressure enters the
chamber.

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Alright. We're gonna pressurize you now.
     I know it's hot in there, but you're
     going to feel coolness.  That's the
     helium.

          NORMAN
     Helium?

          TED
     Was I the only one paying attention?

Ted is so captivated by his pompous explanation that he
doesn't realize his voice is getting higher and
squeakier...In fact, all of their voices have been distorted
by the helium.

          TED
     Oxygen is a corrosive gas in the same
     family as chlorine and fluorine.
     Hydrochloric acid. Hydrofluoric acid.

Everyone's smirking at Ted's seriousness and his squeaky
voice.

          TED (cont'd)
     Essentially that's why we're breathing
     helium down here because oxygen at any
     level higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.

          NORMAN
     Can you run that by me again, Ted.  I
     don't speak fluent balloon.

Everyone laughs -- a squeaky, high-pitched helium laugh...

          TED
         (off their laughter)
     Yes...that's my voice.  The helium
     resonates differently with my vocal
     cords.

          BETH
     Wait a second...

          HARRY
     Follow the yellow brick-road...

          BARNES

     Alright, kiddies, cut it out.  The voice
     regulators are behind you. Put 'em on.

         (helium voice - to Beth)
     How do you like it?

          BETH
         (helium voice)

INT. HABITAT - VIDEO ROOM - LATER

TEENY FLETCHER, a gruff O.S.S.A. lifer in her late 30s, works
the controls (joystick, slide switches) for a remote
robot... Jane Edmunds monitors the video feed.

ANGLE ON TEAM

Clustered around, watching... They all now wear talkers
around their necks that normalize their speech.

          BARNES (V/O)
     Change the angle - different plane.

ANGLE ON MONITORS

A large hole has been excavated through the coral, revealing
what appears to be a door in the spaceship beneath... As
Teeny manipulates the joystick, a suction arm emerges from
the robot, latches onto the door...

          FLETCHER
     Alright.

          BARNES
     Get the plane...get the suction plane
     flat.

          FLETCHER
     This has been a little difficult, sir.

     No, no...you're doing good.  Keep the
     rubber plane flat.

Fletcher continues to manipulate the robot.

          FLETCHER
     There we go.

          BARNES
     No, other way.

          FLETCHER
     Okay.

Ted is playing with his "talker" - the black box around his
neck that regulates his voice.

          TED
     I can't believe these things...mmmmmm

     I'm back.

          BETH
     Is that the door?

          BARNES
     Looks like it.  We did sonar imaging of
     the interior compartments.  That's our
     best bet.
         (to Fletcher)
     Damn it!  It won't budge will it?


          HARRY
     Has it occurred to anyone that maybe we
     shouldn't open that door?

          NORMAN
     Why do you say that?

          HARRY
     We always assume these creatures will be
     green, or insect-like, but basicaily
     human.  But what if they inhale air and
     exhale cyanide gas?  It's perfectly
     plausible.

          BETH
     Or live forever -- like a virus. Or a
     yeast.

          NORMAN
     Why would you assume that an unknown life
     form would want to kill us?

          HARRY
     A creature that can't be killed wouldn't
     think killing was right or wrong.  They'd
     simply have no concept of it.

Ted noses up to the monitor, getting in everyone's way.

          TED
     How tall is that robot?

          FLETCHER
     Five feet.

          HARRY
     Instant extinction.  It's what all the
     serious scientific literature is about --
     what little there is on the subject.
         (to Norman)
     That is in your report, isn't it, Norman?

          NORMAN
     It's in there.

          BARNES
         (to Fletcher)
     Put some suction in it.  Is that piston
     broken?

          TED
     That's roughly the same size as an
     airplane door, isn't it?

          BARNES
     Excuse me, Ted.

          TED
     I just think that's worth taking note of.
     Don't you?

     Ted!
         (to Fletcher)
     Knock the suction up to point-four.

          TED
     Look at how clumsy this thing is.  Three
     million dollars worth of technology and
     it can't open a door.

          BARNES
     Alright, Ted!

          FLETCHER
         (through her teeth)
     There's nothing clumsy about the robot.

          TED
     I'm sorry.  All I'm saying is I think any
     one of us could do better with a crowbar.

          BETH
     Any one of us, Ted? Which any one of us
     would that be?

          TED
     Okay, okay...I admit it. Nothing wrong
     with a little glory in the name of
     science?  Jesus!

Norman emerges from a cloud of bubbles onto the ocean floor,
kicking up sand and clouding up the already murky view...

The LABORED sound of Norman's BREATHING as we look out from

     Alright, Fletcher.  We're at one thousand
     and twenty two feet, ambient temperature

Norman turns and sees a blinding light... shields his eyes --
it's the light on Harry's helmet.

     This is great you guys.  Wow!
         (beat)
     Hey, Norman.  You know, a space launch
     costs a hundred million dollars.  You
     could come down here once a day every day
     for fifty years for that.  The ocean is
     the oldest living environment...so much
     older than the land, yet we don't know
     anything about it.

     Just use your equalizer.

Norman adjusts his equipment.

          NORMAN
     A little better.

          BETH
     You know, the most toxic creatures on
     earth live down here.  The venom of a

     Even the weakest sea snake is inveritably
     lethal.

          NORMAN

Buried under a mountain of coral, it's about as big as an
airport terminal.  With the titanium fin looming beyond...

ANGLE ON BARNES

Near the entrance -- carved through the coral and lit by
tiny hanging bulbs.  Barnes waves them on and they follow him
down.

          BARNES
     This is our airlock.  It'll take us from
     a wet to a dry environment.  We're
     assuming the inside of the ship is
     sealed.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

as he descends awkwardly, grabbing clumsily at the bulky iron
pitons drilled into the coral walls... till he reaches...

PORTABLE AIRLOCK

A large Plexiglas tube reinforced with steel struts, butted
against the door of the spacecraft.  Norman and the rest of
the team enter.  Barnes seals it shut...there's a rush of
incoming gas which pushes the water out...

CLOSE ON NORMAN

as the water recedes down past his face-plate... Then he and
the rest of the team turn toward...

Barnes struggles with the robot.

          BARNES
     Put a light in the digit, Norman.

Norman shines his flashlight inside the robot hand.

          BARNES
     Yeah...maybe it's the hydraulics. The
     pressure messes everything up at this
     depth.

In frustration, Ted grabs a hammer from Barnes' tool kit.

          TED
     Time for a demonstration in basic
     physics, gentlemen.

He goes to the door and bangs on it...

          BETH
     What is this, a pinata party?

          BARNES
     No.  Dr. Fielding is demonstrating
     advanced applied physics for us.

ANGLE ON HARRY

as he notices something... moves toward the door... runs his
finger along the edge... Norman moves alongside him...

          NORMAN
     What is it, Harry?

          HARRY
     Take a look.

Norman looks closely at the door.

          HARRY (cont'd)
     It's chipped.

Then the others gather around them.

          BARNES
     It's chipped.  So what?

          HARRY
     I thought you said there was no damage in
     the crash.  That this titanium alloy was
     super-strong, there was no way you could
     hurt it.

          BARNES
     I did.

          HARRY
     But it gets chipped just from some
     scientist whacking on it with a hammer?

ANGLE ON BETH

As she feels the door with her palms...

          BETH
     Is there heat coming off this thing, or
     is it just happy to see me?

          BARNES
     Get away from there, Beth.

          BETH
     Just one minute.

          BARNES
     I said back off!  Now!

Barnes yanks Beth roughly and shoves her aside.  Angry,
she glares at him.  The door starts to RUMBLE...Barnes
unstraps a weapon... Then the door opens... revealing
blackness inside.

          HARRY
     Is anyone else here wondering who opened
     the door?

Norman moves in, followed by Ted, Harry, Beth and Barnes who
closes the door behind them.

          TED
     How did that happen?

          BARNES
     I'm not sure about the atmosphere.
     Helmets stay on.

          TED
     We come in peace.
         (to Harry)
     I always wanted to say that.

NORMAN'S POV

the craft, a dense web of struts and buttresses...Beth heads
along a separate path of the catwaik...Looks down. Stops.

BETH'S POV

BACK TO SCENE

          BETH
     Somebody's been here.


          HARRY
     What?

          BETH
     Yeah.  There's footsteps, and they ain't
     ours.

Harry joins her.  Looks down.  Then Norman joins them.

          HARRY
     What do you say, Norman? Time to turn
     around?

          NORMAN
     I'm a little curious.

          BARNES
     Let's break up into two squads. We'll
     never cover the ground otherwise.

          HARRY
     Split up?

          TED
     He's got a point.  We've got maybe a half-
     hour of gas left.

          BARNES
     Ted and Harry you come with me.  Beth and
     Norman stick together. Come on.

          HARRY
     I think the people who built this place
     would call that divide and conquer.

          NORMAN
     Whoever built this thing wanted us dead,
     we'd be dead already.
         (beat)
     As a matter of deductive logic, Harry.

INT. SPACECRAFT - LATER

Barnes, Harry and Ted move ahead, their helmet lights
sweeping the surfaces and structures of the craft -- both odd
and oddly familiar.  Barnes inspects one of the girders with
his gloved fingers, then whacks it with the crowbar.

          BARNES
     Look at this, Harry...cross-stress
     bracing for the outer hull.  Tremendous
     support along all axes.  This is
     interesting.  This material -- strong and
     soft at the same time. Better than
     rubber, better than steel.
         (off insulation)
     Heck of a lot of radiation shielding.
     Wonder what that's for?

          HARRY
     You seem to know a lot about this.

          BARNES
     Huh?
           (beat)
     Yeah, I, uh, studied aeronautical
     engineering at M.I.T.  Isn't that where
     you got your Ph.D.?

          TED
     Where I got mine.  All three of them.
     A regular hotbed of academic envy though.

          HARRY
     Ain't that the truth. I hated M.I.T.

          TED
     Envy?

          HARRY
     Puberty.

          TED
     Puberty?  How old?

          HARRY
     First Ph.D, eighteen.

          TED
     Damn!  One year, Harry.  You beat me by
     one year, Harry.

          HARRY
         (singing)
     "What a difference a year makes...."

          TED
     Where'd Dr. Halperin get her Ph.D.?

          BARNES
     On her knees, is what I'd guess.

          HARRY
     You might be underestimating her.

          BARNES
     Oh, yeah?
         (beat)
     Let's push on.

ANGLE ON TED

as he looks around for a place to sit.

          TED
     Man.  They didn't tell you how heavy
     these things were out of water.

He finds a box.  Brushes the silt off the top.  Double-
takes...

          TED
     What the hell --
         (to others)
     Come here -- look at this!

Barnes and Harry join him.  Peer down with their head-
lamps...

INSERT - BOX

Where Ted brushed the silt off, it reads, "TRASH/BASURA".

          BARNES
         (reading)
     'Trash/Basura'?

INT. SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY AND ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

Norman and Beth move through the craft.  Beth finds a door
with a control button.

          BETH
     What do you think?

Norman shrugs.  Beth moves to press the button.  Norman stops
her.

          NORMAN
     Listen, Beth, I've got a dilemma. I have
     to tell you something about the report.

          BETH
     Okay.

          NORMAN
     You know, I needed the money.  Ellen
     wanted to buy a house and I was broke --
     the divorce had cleaned me out... These
     guys show up with a federal grant to
     study the psychological effects of an
     alien invasion --

          BETH
     What are you saying, Norman?

          NORMAN
     I mean...I needed money to buy a house.

          BETH
     Uh, huh...

          NORMAN
     So I made it up.

          BETH
     You made what up?

          NORMAN
     I made up the report.

          BETH
     You made up the report?

          NORMAN
     Not all of it. I mean, I did research
     on half of it.

Beat.

          BETH
     Well, who did the other half?

          NORMAN
     I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
     Isaac Asimov...Rod Serling.

          BETH
     Rod Serling?  This isn't the Twilight
     Zone, Norman, and I can't change the
     channel, so what do you want me to do
     now?

          NORMAN
     I'm just telling you, Beth.  I mean, who
     the hell would think that anyone would
     ever read those government reports?
     What's the odds of it? You know what I
     mean? I show up and I've got half the
     Pacific Fleet here. I didn't know what to
     do. I just wanted to tell you, that's all.

Beat.

          BETH
     Would this fall under the same category
     as "Gee, Beth, I thought you knew I was
     married?"

          NORMAN
     Boy, you don't forget, do you?  I don't
     think we have enough oxygen to talk this
     through now.

          BETH
     I don't think there's nough oxygen to
     talk this through...ever.

Beth angrily presses the button and she heads inside, then
stops.  Norman tentatively follows her.  Suddenly they're
elevated with a fast jolt.  Beth screams.

          NORMAN
     Who pushed the button?  Did you push
     something?

          BETH
     No.

INT. SPACECRAFT - FLIGHT DECK

Norman and Beth arrive at the flight deck. It is extremely
dark.  They discover a large, contoured console -- but with
no instrumentation of any kind. Norman feels his way around
what seems to be a leather chair...

          NORMAN
     This must be the cockpit. Hold
     on...here's a chair.

He sits down.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     You know, this is fairly comfortable.

          BETH
     Norman, do you hear a kind of gurgling
     sound?

          NORMAN
     Gurgling... Aaaaargh!

Suddenly the chair grabs him... Squeezing his shoulders,
grabbing his hips, wrapping around his head... as if it was
swallowing him... Beth screams.

          BETH
     Norman!

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Oh, yeah.  You know, they're seatbelts.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

As he disappears into the chair... Being swallowed up by it.
Beth screaming, "Norman! Norman!" And then it stops.

          NORMAN
     I'm okay.

Then a loud WHIR as the CHAIR snaps forward, zooms up tight
to the console.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Er...Beth, I could use a little
     help.  Beth.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

He maintains his composure by dint of will.  Then his face is
bathed in a soft Christmastime glow of colored lights.

          BETH
     Norman!  Norman!

He gestures down with his eyes.  She follows his gaze...

ANGLE ON CONSOLE

As it begins to take on depth... The instrumentation is
somehow within the surface of the console, like a hologram...
"POS THRUSTERS"... "F3 PISTON BOOSTER".."GLIDER".."SIEVES"...

          NORMAN
     Beth, you still with me?

          BETH
         (reading)
     Yeah.  The symbols...the symbols are in
     English.

          NORMAN
     English?

          BETH
     Yes, English.  Our mother tongue.

          NORMAN
     There must be an explanation.

          BETH
     Well, there's something weird going on
     here, Norman.  There's something Barnes
     isn't telling us.

          NORMAN
     Well, Beth, while you're ruminating, do
     you think you can find the chair release
     button.

          BETH
     Oh!
         (reading)
     Ignition...

          NORMAN
     No, not that one.

Beth explores the console.  Finds the appropriate control.
Touches it.

          BETH
     Here.  This is it, I think.

The chair unwraps around Norman.

          NORMAN
     There you go.

Norman relaxes.  Beth turns and sees that the chair beside
Norman has opened as well. And there's a skeleton in uniform
inside it.

          BETH
     Aaaargh!

          NORMAN
     Oh, God!

Beth examines the skeleton with her scientific sangfroid.

          BETH
     Jesus!  It's human.

          NORMAN
     You mean humanoid?

          BETH
     No, Norman.  I mean human.
         (off skeleton)
     Blunt force trauma. You can see by the
     direction that the fracture runs, that he
     was hit in the back of the head.

          NORMAN
     What's in his hand?

          BETH
     I don't know.

Norman takes a small package from the skeleton's hand.

          BETH
     What is it?

          NORMAN
     Smokehouse almonds?

They look at each other a beat.

          BETH
     My God -- it's an American spaceship.

They exchange a look as they absorb this stunning revelation.

          NORMAN
     It can't be an American spaceship. It's
     three hundred years old. There weren't
     even Americans, let alone spaceships.

          BETH
     Well, it can't be, but it is.

          NORMAN
     Okay.  Let's see if there's some kind of
     flight recorder or data computer that we
     can ring up a flight history.  Just punch
     punch... punch... punch something!

          BETH
     Alright.  Let me try this thing again.

Beth touches the console...

ANGLE ON THEIR FACEPLATES

     Look at the dates. That can't be --

          BETH
     It could be.  It could be 2043 or 1643.
     I don't know which one is weirder.

          NORMAN
     'Unknown Entry Event'?  Press that.

          BETH
     Are you sure?

          NORMAN
     Yes.

Beth presses the console at "Unknown Entry Event"...

ANGLE ON SCREEN

As it expands... A sort of hologram created all around
them...As they streak through a galaxy, stars and planets all
around them... They feel like they're falling into outer
space...

Then in the middle of the screen, a black spot... That gets
bigger... Then suddenly has a white cluster in the middle of
it... As if they're flying toward a giant black donut...

And then...nothing... They sit a beat in the eerie blankness
and silence...

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     This is Barnes.  Norman?

Norman and Beth exchange a look.

          NORMAN
     Yes, I can hear you. I can't explain it,
     but I think we're inside an American
     spacecraft.

          BARNES (V.O.)
     It gets better.

     What the hell is it?

          BARNES
     Whatever it is, it seems to be what this

     space and gather things like this up and
     bring it back.

          TED
     Yeah...but back from where?

          HARRY
     Don't get too excited, Ted.  We'll turn
     it over and it'll say, 'Made in Korea.'

          TED
     Somehow I doubt that, Harry.

          BARNES
     What do you think, Norman?

          NORMAN
     I'm still working on what the hell is it.

          BARNES
     No hinges... No doors of any kind...

          TED
     I bet if you put a laser micrometer on
     this you'd find it's a perfect sphere.  I
     mean a perfect sphere -- down to a
     thousandth of an inch.  That's a message
     in itself.

          HARRY
     Really.

          BARNES
     What do you mean?

          TED
     I mean when Pope Benedict asked Giotto
     for a drawing to prove his worth as an
     artist, what he did was draw a perfect
     circle freehand. Perfection is a powerful
     message.

          BETH
     I know what the Zen masters would say.

          HARRY
     What's that?

          BETH
     The ball wants to be caught.

          BARNES
     Nobody built a thing like this looking
     into his third eye.  They went to a lot
     of trouble.  And they didn't do it for
     nothing. Something put it out there to
     get picked up and brought back. Are you
     forgetting the Trojan Horse? It could be
     a trap.

          TED
     That sounds a little paranoid, don't you
     think, Barnes?

          BARNES
     Paranoia is a disease.  Fear is useful.
     Defense is basic -- down to the simplest
     one-cell organism. Us.  Them.
         (checks watch)
     We'll leave a video camera here, keep an
     eye on it.

          NORMAN
     Can I ask you something about this
     reflective surface --

Barnes edges up to the sphere.

          BARNES
     It looks like it's made of mercury.
     Except mercury is a liquid at this
     temperature.

          NORMAN
     No.  That's not what I'm talking about.
     What worries me is that it's reflecting
     everything but us.

Barnes steps back to get a better look. The team edges up
beside Norman...

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     I hate to be the one non-scientist who
     picks this up, guys.  You know what I
     mean? What do you think it is?

THEIR POV

It's true.  A perfect mirror image of everything in the cargo
bay but them.

          TED
     Yes, that's right.  What if the craft
     inadvertently flew into a black hole.  It
     arrived in our past from its present.
     What about those dates you saw on the
     flight recorder.

          NORMAN
     '43, '47 --

          TED
     That's right. That has to be two thousand
     forty three...two thousand forty seven.
     That image that you told me you saw on
     the monitor...from what you describe that
     sounds exactly like a black hole...a tear
     in the space...

          HARRY
     We know what a black hole is, Ted.

          NORMAN
     I don't know what a black hole is.

          HARRY
     A black hole is a collapsed dead star
     that has so much gravity it acts like a
     huge vacuum cleaner, sucking everything
     into it.  A light interstellar dust...
     time...

          TED
     Time.

          HARRY
     It's possible, but not plausible.

          TED
     It's more than probable, it's rudimentary
     astrophysics.  We just haven't been able
     to fly into one and prove it.

          HARRY
     Well, Ted, sounds like you've got this
     all figured out.

Barnes enters.

          BARNES
     Well, I just got off the horn topside.
     Expecting a bad blow-up there. They're
     pulling us out.

          TED
     Pulling us out?  Wait a minute...what do
     you mean, pulling us out?  What does that
     mean, pulling us out?

          HARRY
     What part of 'pull out' don't you
     understand, Ted?  Extraction...we're
     leaving.

          TED
     No...no...that's ridiculous.  I mean,
     we haven't even begun to scratch the
     surface down here.

          BARNES
     If you've ever seen these Pacific
     cyclones -- what we call a tornado is
     nothing more than a little fart, so I
     suggest you go back to the dormitory and
     take a nap.  You need to lower your
     metabolism before the decompression.

          TED
     You're just gonna leave a time-traveling
     spacecraft at the bottom of the coean?

          BARNES
     I'm just going to follow my orders, Ted.

          BETH
     We're the Welcome Wagon for the aliens,
     right?  There's no aliens. It's all Made
     in America.

          TED
         (to Beth)
     What's your point?

          BETH
     My point is I'm a biochemist. There's no
     life down here, and you guys are bugging
     the shit out of me.

          TED
     What is wrong with all of you? That
     doesn't mean there's nothing left to
     learn -- nothing to explore -- Jesus!

          BARNES
         (cutting him off)
     She's right, Ted.  You guys are the human
     contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
     There is no Unknown Life Form.
         (beat)
     So, we're pulling out at oh-nine hundred.

          TED
     Norman, will you please say something to
     him.

          NORMAN
     What?

          TED
     I don't know.  Do you not have an opinion
     about this?

          NORMAN
     Yes.  I'm delighted we're going back up
     top.  You know what I mean?
     I mean, I don't know about you, this
     might look like a road-side diner, but in
     the meantime, my ears won't pop...if I
     pull this thing away from my neck I sound
     like someone's squeezing my testicles.
     Let's go home.

Ted takes Barnes aside.

          TED
     Look, why don't you tell me.  What is it
     you don't want us to find out, huh?

          BARNES
     I don't want you to find out what I
     really think of you.

ANGLE ON HARRY AND NORMAN

          NORMAN
     Harry.  Doesn't it seem odd to you that
     Barnes was so excited about coming down
     here, but he wasn't the least bit upset
     about going up?

          HARRY
     We're on the same page.

Norman puts his finger in his ear to release pressure.

          HARRY (cont'd)
     Equalize, Norman.

          NORMAN
     What do you mean?

          HARRY
     You know how to equalize, don't you? Just
     pinch your nostrils together and blow.

          NORMAN
     Don't get racy.

INT. DORMITORY - LATER

Beth and Ted sleep. Harry reads a paperback novel to mask his
anxiety.  Norman brushes his teeth.

          HARRY
     ...Barnes is wrong, you know.

          NORMAN
     What do you mean?  Wrong about the storm?

          HARRY
     No...about The Sphere.

          NORMAN
     What about The Sphere?

          HARRY
     It's alive.

Norman stops a beat.  Thinks.  Then turns to Harry.

          NORMAN
     Why do you say that, Harry?

          HARRY
     There's something inside it.

          NORMAN
     How could there be anything inside it?
     There's no doors, no seams...

          HARRY
     The Sphere chooses what it will and won't
     reflect.  Doesn't that seem like the
     actions of a conscious being to you?

          NORMAN
     Okay...pop psychology - you want to know
     what this is really about I think, for
     what it's worth?  Your anger towards our
     friend, Ted in there, is because he
     figured this out before you did.

Beat.

          HARRY
     You really think so?

          NORMAN
     I don't know.  This is my first
     underwater session.

They laugh.

          HARRY
     You're right.  Ted did figure it out
     first, didn't he?  Good shrinkage.

Harry takes a slow, rueful, ruminative beat.  Then:

          HARRY
     We're all going to die down here, you
     know.

This stops Norman.

          NORMAN
     What? What?

          HARRY
     You see, it's curious, Ted did figure it
     out. Time travel. And when we get back,
     we're gonna tell everyone...how it's
     possible.  How it's done.  What the
     dangers are.  But then why, fifty years
     in the future, when this spacecraft
     encounters a black hole, does the
     computer call it an 'Unknown Entry
     Event'?  Why don't they know? If they
     don't know, it means we never told
     anyone, and if we never told anyone, it
     means we never made it back. Hence, we
     die down here.
         (beat)
     Just as a matter of deductive logic,
     Norman.

As he absorbs this...

          HARRY

     know what he's doing?  Come on, Norman,
     there's no time.  I need to know what you
     know.

          NORMAN
     Nothing.  He said he wanted to go inside,
     I just didn't think --

          BARNES
     We are inside, Norman.  You mean outside?

          NORMAN
     He said inside.

          BARNES

     Well, what the hell's going on?  He
     didn't just disappear.

          BARNES
     I don't know.  I don't think he

Fletcher hustles back inside.

     minutes or less.

          EDMUNDS (V.O.)

     The only logical explanation is that the
     sub is still at the surface.

     Isn't it also logically possible your
     sonar's messed up?

Barnes punches up some controls.

     Okay, let's just calm down, alright? He
     didn't just disappear.  We're not going
     to leave him.

          BARNES
     You got that right, Norman.  We're not
     going to leave without him.  I'm not
     going to lose a civilian on my watch...

     How much oxygen do we have left?

          BARNES
     The storm'll only last 72 hours. At the

     oxygen, barring any unforeseen --

          BETH
     Unforeseen?  You mean like Harry going in
     The Sphere?

          BARNES
     What exactly is your point?

          BETH
     My point is, Harry should never have been
     anywhere near that sphere.  If you were
     doing your job instead of fuddling around
     here like some middle-aged man who's lost
     his keys, we'd all be breathing fresh air
     right now instead of worrying about how
     much oxygen...

          BARNES
     For someone who's worried about oxygen,
     you sure are using it up.

          BETH
     I know you're not with O.S.S.A.  You're
     doing a good job of pretending, turning
     dials and flipping switches, but you
     don't know one end of a rudder from the
     other. We're all counting on you like you
     know something about how to get us back
     safely. Or even care.

          BARNES
     I know enough not to get killed down

          BETH
     Good for you.

Barnes gives her a hard look.

          BARNES
     Beth, let me ask you a question.  What
     exactly are your qualifications for being
     here?

          BETH
     Guess.

          BARNES
     Well, I mean Norman chose Harry - a
     genius kid from the slums of Philadelphia
     ...in six years he had a Ph.D;
     Norman chose Ted - a whiz kid
     astrophysicist...and Norman chose you.
     Why are you here? Are you the most
     qualified in your field?  Norman must
     have thought so. Then again, the report's
     a few years old, maybe things have
     changed.

Beth glares at Barnes.  He stares her down.  She storms out.

INT. CONTROL SHAFT - LATER

The guts of the habitat.  Fletcher adjusts a valve as Barnes
comes over the intercom.

          BARNES (V.O.)
     ... Can I have your attention?  We have
     lost contact with the surface.  The
     habitat is now operating solely under
     internal power...

Beth strides angrily down the corridor...

          BARNES (V.O.)
     ... We have plenty of food, oxygen, and,
     fresh water to sustain us until the storm
     is over and we re-establish contact with
     the surface.

As he sleeps in his bunk.  Visible beneath his eyelids, rapid
eye movement as he dreams...

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (on the intercom)
     ...But until that time, this mission is
     subject to emergency authority under my
     command.  This is Barnes.  Over and out.

PUSHING THROUGH PORTHOLE

Jellyfish swarm outside the habitat...

INT. VIDEO ROOM - LATER

Barnes with Ted and Fletcher as he punches a few commands at
the computer.  Takes a videotape out of the console. Stacks
it up with the other videotapes.

          FLETCHER
     I'm going to take this out to the mini-
     sub, sir.

          BARNES
     You're up on the duty roster?

          FLETCHER
     Yes, sir.

          BARNES
     Alright.

Fletcher.

          TED
     Where's she going?

          BARNES
     Procedures. Everything in the habitat is
     videoed, so every twelve hours we take
     the video storage out to the mini-sub and
     press the reset button.  The idea is, if
     something happens to us and we don't
     reset it, the sub goes to the surface
     automatically, so if we're all dead, they
     at least have a partial record of what
     went wrong.
         (off Ted's look)
     Cheerful thought, huh?
         (getting up)
     Mind the store a minute.

Barnes exits.  Ted swivels into position to watch...

ANGLE ON MONITORS

An exterior view of the habitat as Fletcher splashes down
out of the airlock...

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Beth stands in front of a sink.  She opens a bottle of pills.
Takes a pill out, breaks it in half and washes it down with
water.  Then she swallows the other half pill and washes that
down.

INT. DORMITORY - CLOSE ON HARRY - SAME TIME

Harry suddenly opens his eyes wide.

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

Fletcher sweeps through a pretty cloud of pink jellyfish...
Like tiny dancers with blooming pink petticoats... The mini-
sub visible in the distance.

          FLETCHER
         (to intercom)
     This is beautiful. It's snowing down
     here. There's got to be a million
     jellyfish down here.

                              CUT TO:

Ted looks at the view on the monitors...

     They're sticking to my face-plate.

          TED
         (to intercom)
     Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Swim
     through them.  They're harmless.

Barnes enters, turns to the monitors and his jaw drops...

Fletcher all but lost in a dense snowfall of jellyfish...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

Fletcher struggles through the sea of jellyfish...

          FLETCHER
         (over intercom)
     Hey, guys...I think they feel the heat
     from my legs --

Then Fletcher howls.

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (to intercom)
     Fletcher, get out of there.

          FLETCHER
         (over intercom)
     They're stinging me through the --

     Aaaaaargh!

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (to intercom)
     Fletcher, I want you back at the habitat
     on the double.

Fletcher thrashes...

          FLETCHER
         (over intercom)
     I can't move my legs.  It's burning!

          BARNES
         (to intercom)
     Come back to the habitat.

          FLETCHER
         (over intercom)
     They're inside my suit! They're inside my
     --

          BARNES
         (to intercom)
     Keep moving...keep moving.  Just keep
     moving...

Fletcher thrashes as the water rises inside her
faceplate... And then a jellyfish swims up... stings her in
the eyeball... Then they're swarming into her nose, her
mouth...

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Fletcher, come on.

          FLETCHER
     Aaaaaaaaaaargh!

          TED
     Jesus Christ!  Can't you do something?

     No.

Barnes and Ted watch, horrified, powerless, as Fletcher
disappears in the cloud of jellyfish.  And then her SCREAMS
STOP.  And there's just the jellyfish.

     Yes, sir?

INT. HABITAT - SICK BAY - LATER

Fletcher lies dead on a gurney, her naked body studded
with jellyfish.  Beth wears scrubs, a surgical tray
beside her.  Norman, also in scrubs, watches as Beth
reaches for a long stainless-steel tweezers...

          BETH
     At this level of toxicity, the blood
     vessels dilate. Blood pressure falls
     through the floor.  They go right into
     shock.
     I saw a little boy down at Orchard Beach
     attacked by a school of jellyfish.

          NORMAN
     You've seen jellyfish aggressive like
     this?

          BETH
     I haven't seen piranha aggressive like
     this.
         (starts working on Fletcher)
     Okay...rock and roll.

CLOSE ON FLETCHER

As Beth probes with the tweezers up Fletcher's nose and into
her sinus cavity... Norman grimaces, looks away as Beth pulls
out a jellyfish.

BACK TO SCENE

          BETH
     What's the matter, Norman?  You never saw
     a dead body before?

          NORMAN
     As a matter of fact, I've seen one dead
     body in two different counties.

          BETH
     Ouch.  The plane crashes.  I forgot.

          NORMAN
     I've just never seen a jellyfish coming
     out of a human being's nasal cavity
     before.

          BETH
     Well, you live and learn.

          NORMAN
     When I was five years old, I was out in a
     boat with my father, he told me not to
     jump in so of course I had to.  Right
     into a school of these guys. Not this big
     though.  I think everyone had a shot at
     me.  I don't know what this lady felt,
     but man, it went beyond pain...it
     was...it was...

          BETH
     Would it make you feel any better if I
     tell you this isn't exactly a jellyfish?

          NORMAN
     What do you mean?

Beth pokes at the jellyfish on the tray.

          BETH
     Jellyfish like this are unheard of.

          NORMAN
     Well, congratulations.  You've just
     discovered a brand new species.

          BETH
     You know, Norman, if you had spent a
     much time as I have sitting at a lab
     bench, you would know when something had
     been touched by the hand of God.

          NORMAN
     I'm just complimenting you.  Why are you
     angry?  I'm not being critical.

          BETH
     I'm just saying...God didn't make this.
     Okay.  It's fictional, it's a forgery,
     it's a copy...it's...moving!

INSERT - JELLYFISH

The jellyfish moves toward Beth as she adroitly impales it
with a scalpel.

          NORMAN
     Beth, are you sure it's moving?

          BETH
     No, Norman, I lied.

          NORMAN
     Maybe I don't understand.  I was just
     trying to make the point that you of all
     people, I would think, would want to keep
     this creature alive to study, not hack it
     up...if it was alive.

          BETH
     Look, don't try to get inside my brain,
     okay?

          NORMAN
     I care about you.

          BETH
     Great!  I like to work alone.  Thanks.

INT. BARNES' QUARTERS - LATER

Barnes reads through the cables with his feet up on his bunk.
A KNOCK at his door.

          BANRES
     Come on in.

Norman enters.

          NORMAN
     You called for me?

          BARNES
     Have a seat, Norman.  Coffee?

          NORMAN
     No thanks.

Barnes refills his mug from a Thermos.

          BARNES
     How long have you known Dr. Halperin?

          NORMAN
     I used to teach at UC San Diego, years
     ago.  She came to do her master's there.

          BARNES
     What'd you teach - psychology?

          NORMAN
     They require a pretty full teaching load--
     that's one of the reasons I left.

          BARNES
     They squeeze you, don't they?  Then you
     have to see patients on top of it.

          NORMAN
     They're gonna get their money's worth,
     one way or another.

          BARNES
     You and Dr. Halperin seen pretty close.

          NORMAN
     We've fallen out of touch over the years.
     Why?

          BARNES
     Well, don't take this personally, Norman,
     but I assume she wasn't a romantic
     interest of yours.

          NORMAN
     I'm sorry...don't take what personally?

          BARNES
     She's a tall, vibrant, younger woman...

          NORMAN
     And I was married.

          BARNES
     Then you saw her as a patient.

          NORMAN
     I'm not at liberty to discuss that.  You
     understand.

          BARNES
     What I understand is that an exotic-gas
     environment a thousand feet underwater
     with no link to the surface is just about
     the most dangerous place on the planet.
     If there's a problem, I need to know.

          NORMAN
     Beth is fine.

          BARNES
     Beth is fine?  Beth is fine?

          NORMAN
     She's very fine.

Barnes suddenly throws a fax transmission at Norman.

          BARNES
     Beth's fine? Okay...what about this?
     You want to read it? What does it say,
     Norman?

          NORMAN
         (reading fax)
     These are my actual notes.  How in the
     world did you...

          BARNES
     What does it say, Norman?

          NORMAN
     She was having some problems with a
     boyfriend.

          BARNES
     Does it say 'suicide attempt'?

          NORMAN
     How did you get a hold of my papers?

          BARNES
     Does it say 'electric shock therapy'?
     Isn't that what it says, Norman?

          NORMAN
     What's your point?

          BARNES
     My point is you didn't feel it was
     important enough to mention this to
     somebody? You're willing to jeopardize
     the lives of all of these people by
     having someone here who could in fact be
     mentally unstable?!

          NORMAN
     Are you aware of the term 'over-
     reacting.'

          BARNES
     Don't play with me, you little shit!
     We're 160 fathoms down and now we've got
     a nut bag down here who can flip-out and
     crack up. why didn't you tell me that?

          NORMAN
     I can't believe you had someone go into
     my office...take my personal records.

          BARNES
     You chose the team, Norman.  Why didn't
     you tell me this?

          NORMAN
     When I wrote this report, I didn't know
     the team was going to be a thousand feet
     underwater.

          BARNES
     It doesn't matter if it's a thousand feet
     or ten feet, why didn't you tell me about
     her past mental history?

          NORMAN
     I didn't think it was pertinent.

          BARNES
     It was not for you to make that decision.

          NORMAN
     It was a passive attempt.

          BARNES
     A passive attempt?

          NORMAN
     Yes.  People who really want to kill
     themselves get a gun and shoot
     themselves, or go off a bridge, they
     don't call their boyfriend and say: "I
     just took 20 Nebutol...help me."

          BARNES
     She took twenty yellows and you're
     telling me she's perfect?

There's a KNOCK at the door.

          BARNES
     Yeah?

Ted enters, thoughtfully rubbing his chin.

Harry eats a big farmer's breakfast with great gusto as the
team, skeptical and scared, surround him at the table.
Norman prepares food for the others at the stove.

          HARRY
     ... Man oh man, you got a problem with
     me, Barnes.
         (gestures to Norman)
     Because as long as my good buddy Norman
     keeps cooking like this I ain't leaving.
     Wheeee!  Ummmmm-ummm.  I mean, this
     toast is good, and the bacon is better.
     But the eggs are fantastic! What've you
     got in here? Wait, don't tell me.
         (closes eyes, inhales deeply)
     Parsley... Chives... Tarragon... Chervil!
     Is it chervil?

          NORMAN
         Yes, it is. I'm glad you like it.

          HARRY
         Eggs!  I'm telling you, eggs? I love
         eggs!

          BETH
         They sure have improved your mood.

          HARRY
         (to Beth)
     How 'bout it?  You keep laying them and
     I'll keep eating them.

He elbows her and nearly knocks her off her chair.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

Watching Harry, as if he's under a microscope...So is Barnes.
They exchange a look.  Then Barnes gingerly launches in.

          BARNES
     Harry, with you and The Sphere -- do you
     remember what happened?

          HARRY
     Of course I remember what happened.  I
     went inside.

          TED
     How did you get inside? There are no
     doors.

          HARRY
     This place is full of doors and we can't
     get out.  We're still here.

Barnes forces a chuckle.

          BARNES
     So we are, so we are...

          TED
     You still didn't answer my question,
     Harry.

Harry resumes eating his eggs. From behind Harry's back,
Norman assesses Harry with a shrewd, appraising gaze.  As if
he has eyes in back of his head, Harry catches him doing it.

          HARRY
     Why are you looking at me like that,
     Norman?

Then Harry turns.  Norman's eyes crinkle in a kindly
smile.

          NORMAN
     Er...I'm jealous, Harry.  I love eggs,
     but my cholesterol...You're making me
     hungry.

Harry laughs heartily. Norman brings a big platter of
calamari to the table... Harry spears a few with his fork.

          BARNES
         (circling back)
     Are you saying we shouldn't still be
     here, Harry?

          HARRY
         (looking around)
     Hey, where's Teeny? I thought she did
     all the cooking.  Not that I'm
     complaining, Norman, this is great. And
     grits, you got everything down here.
     Where did you learn to cook grits,
     Norman?

          NORMAN
     I wasn't sure you'd like them.

          HARRY
     You had a nanny.
         (laughs)
     So, where is Teeny?

          BARNES
     Teeny had an unfortunate accident. She
     was killed.

          HARRY
     Killed? How?

BEAT.

          BARNES
     By jellyfish.

          HARRY
     Jellyfish?  That's strange.

          BARNES
         (beat)
     Yes, it is strange, isn't it.

Norman brings Harry another plate of food.

          NORMAN
     Here you go, Harry.

Harry digs in.

          HARRY
     Whoa, onion rings.

          NORMAN
     It's not onion rings.

          HARRY
     Good though.

          NORMAN
     Guess what it is?

          HARRY
     What?

          NORMAN
     Calamari.

Suddenly, Harry spits out his calamari... Starts to gag...

          HARRY
     Uccch!  Aaaaargh!  Squid!

Ted runs around the table and gives Harry the Heimlich
maneuver... Harry struggles to say something... Ted
vigorously pumps at Harry, lifting him high in the air...

          TED
     Okay, Harry, bring it up!  Bring it up,
     big fella!

          NORMAN
     Ted.  Ted!  I think he's trying to say
     something!

Ted stops the Heimlich maneuver.  Harry shrugs him off.

          HARRY
     I'm not choking, you asshole!  I just
     hate squid!

Ted backs off.

          TED
     I m sorry.  I was trying to help you.

Barnes warily takes the platter of calamari away.  Harry sits
down again. Norman sits opposite him.

          HARRY
     I hate squid!

          NORMAN
     As long as it wasn't my cooking, okay?
         (beat)
     Can I ask you something, Harry? Before
     you went inside The Sphere, you were
     convinced that we were all going to die
     down here.

          HARRY
     I remember that.

     Do you still believe that?

          HARRY
         (nods)
     Are you afraid to die, Norman?

          NORMAN
     You know, I just thought, if we're gonna
     die, thought I'd have a couple of eggs.

INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM - SAME TIME

Edmunds is sitting at the bank of computers which are all
blank.  She looks relieved.  Suddenly numbers start scrolling
up on the monitor directly in front of her.  She hits the
keyboard to clear the screen, but the numbers keep
coming...on another computer screen, then another and
another, until all the screens are scrolling numbers. She
frantically hits keys, but the numbers remain.

Ted and Norman walk away from the Cafeteria.

          TED
     Bullshit! Bullshit! He's hiding
     something.

          NORMAN
     What are you talking about?

          TED
     He was in there. He went inside the
     Sphere.  Whatever it was he saw, he
     doesn't want to tell us.

          NORMAN
     He doesn't remember anything.

          TED
     Oh, come on, Norman. You bought that?
     No! no!  That whole food thing, it was
     all a diversion.  He wants to keep it all
     to himself.  Think about it.  The guy's
     willing to put all of our lives on the
     line because he doesn't want to share
     information...

          NORMAN
     Ted, I think....

          TED
     I can see it right now...he's making
     notes for his new book. Wants to win the
     Nobel Prize.

          NORMAN
     And you don't?

          TED
     No!  ...yeah.  Norman, you've known me
     since I was 17 years old.  I would love
     to be the guy who gets the recognition.

          NORMAN
     Have you any idea how respected in your
     field you are?

          TED
     I'm not.  What have I done?  No. I've
     written one "Fun with Dick and Jane" book
     on physics. I mean, for christ sake, Neils
     Bohr, he published 'The Quantum Theory
     of Atomic Structure' I think when he was
     28.  Einstein - "Relativity", 26...Newton
     - "Gravity", 23.  Norman, in physics, if
     you haven't done it by the time you're
     35, the chances are you never will.

          NORMAN
     And this has nothing to do with being
     competitive with Harry?

Ted gives Norman a look.

          TED
     Harry?

          NORMAN
     Harry.

          TED
     Harry...19.  Wunderkind!

          NORMAN
     I rest my case.

          TED
     Norman, I'm thirty years old.

          NORMAN
     I wish I was.

Ted laughs.

Then Edmunds comes toward them.

          EDMUNDS
     Mr. Barnes would like to see you, Ted.

          TED
     Why?

          EDMUNDS
     There's something wrong with the computer
     system.

REVERSE ANGLE - TED

as he tinkers at the keyboard, Barnes beside him.

          BARNES
     Try purging it.

          TED
     Every time I purge it, it comes back.

          BARNES
     You think it's a discharge from the
     buffer memory?

          TED
     I ruled that out.

Edmunds enters.

          EDMUNDS
     You figure that out yet?

          TED
     Not yet.

          EDMUNDS
     You want me to take a whack at it?

          TED
     Why not?  I only have three advanced
     degrees.  It's not like I went to
     cosmetology school.

          EDMUNDS
         (brittle, to Barnes)
     The sonar's still malfunctioning, sir.
     I'm going to go see if I can't clear off
     the transducer ports.  Manual labor --
     maybe that's more my speed.

          BARNES
     Okay.  Just be careful out there.

          EDMUNDS
     Yes, sir.

Edmunds exits.  Barnes turns back to Ted.

          BARNES
     Why'd you have to bust her chops, huh?
     She's the only person who knows how to
     run this joint. A little respect wouldn't
     kill you.

          TED
     Point taken.  I'm sorry.
         (beat)
     I think the helium is getting to the
     chips.  Saturation effect.

          BARNES
     If that's true, what are the options?

          TED
     You'd have to replace the chips.

          BARNES
     If we have to operate this place on
     manual it's gonna be a long four days.

ANGLE ON HARRY

as he enters, eating an apple.  Glances over at the computer.

          HARRY
     Hey, boss.  Ted.
         (off computer)
     You figure that out yet?

          TED
     It's some kind of saturation effect.

          HARRY
     I don't think so. If it was a saturation
     effect it'd be random.

          TED
     What do you mean?

          HARRY
     This has a pattern.  See, it's like a
     code.

Harry leans over to the keyboard, highlights the sequence
that repeats.  Ted moves closer -- upset that he missed it.
Harry grabs a pad and pencil, starts to write...

          BARNES
     A code from where?

          TED
         (re: Harry's code letters)
     How do you do that?

          BARNES
     How do you see that?

          HARRY
     Try it in binary.

Ted rattles at the keyboard.

ON SCREEN

The numbers change to a string of "0"s and "1"s... They stare
at it a quick beat.

          HARRY
     It gives you the letter breaks.

          TED
     Do you think it's coming from The Sphere?

          HARRY
     Don't know.

          BARNES
     Harry, this whole mission is classified
     Ultra Top Secret.  Any messages you
     decode are for my eyes only.

Harry shows them what he's been writing...

INSERT - HARRY'S PAD

He's pencilled in the alphabet as it's arrayed on a computer
keyboard.

BACK TO SCENE

          HARRY
     If you were it, how would you know the
     alphabet?  The way it's organized on the
     keyboard.

Ted thinks hard...

          TED
     But, reflected in an orb, spherically.
         (off Harry's look)
     A keyboard, but spherical.  Take the
     keyboard and wind it around a sphere.
     Then starting at the center key "g",
     number the letters, spiraling out.

Harry stops, stunned.  Then breaks into a broad smile.

          HARRY
     Ted!  You're the man!

Harry tosses aside the pad, sits down at the computer. Works
frantically.  Ted rubs his hands together.

          TED
     I'm telling you, I still got it. I still
     got the juice.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

putting on his glasses to get a better look.

          NORMAN
     Oh, boy!

          TED
         (to Norman
     They let you keep those?

Norman offers his glasses to Ted.

ANGLE ON COMPUTER

As a topographical model of a sphere appears on the screen...
Then the computer winds the keyboard around it, starting in
the middle with the letter "J" and then spiralling around...

          HARRY (O.S.)
     Now all that's left is to plug in the
     numbers...

Harry selects the sequence of the numbers that repeats, types
a command into the computer.

As they stare at this in amazement... The epiphany of
contact with an extraplanetary being...

          HARRY
     My friends, in eight thousand years of
     recorded history, this is a first.  You
     are on-line with an alien intelligence.

Ted reaches out, touches the screen reverentially...

          BARNES
     You've got to be kidding me.  You must
     have messed up the translation.

          HARRY
     I don't think so.

          BARNES
     If this translation is right, this alien
     sounds like an idiot.

          BETH
     It could be something to consider -- a
     stupid alien.
         (off Ted's look)
     Well, they must have them.

          HARRY
     The content certainly appears childish.
     But when you think about it, it's highly
     logical.  A simple message -- lucid,
     friendly, unthreatening -- the way you'd
     address a small child.  Or a dog.

          BARNES
     You must've made some mistake
     translating it.

ANGLE ON SCREEN

As more numbers type out...

          TED
     Look at this.

          BARNES
     It's making a speech.

Harry hits a command and presses enter and the message is
translated...

         (on computer)
     I AM PLEASED TO BE IN CONTACT WITH
     YOUR ENTITIES.  I AM ENJOYING THIS
     MUCH.

          BARNES
     Ask him for his last name.

          HARRY
     What?

          BARNES
     I want a full name for my report. I'm not
     going to write in my report that a crew
     member died on a deepsat expedition to
     find an alien named Jerry.  Please.
     Jerry?

          TED
     I think we should tell him we're enjoying
     it too.

          BARNES
     I still can't believe we had a President
     named Jerry.

          NORMAN
     Ask him where he's from.

ANGLE ON COMPUTER

As Harry types... "WHERE ARE YOU FROM?" Then more numbers.

          THE SPHERE
     I MAKE A JOURNEY. YOU MAKE A
     JOURNEY. WE MAKE A JOURNEY TOGETHER.

          BETH
     I think Jerry is channeling Deepak
     Chopra.

          HARRY
     A journey from where?

          THE SPHERE
     I AM HAPPY.

          TED
     He's happy.

          NORMAN
     He's crafty.

ANGLE ON COMPUTER

As Harry types... 'A JOURNEY FROM WHERE?' But no response.
Norman peers at the screen...

          HARRY
     I think he's gone.

          BARNES
     Did you -- ?  Did you get a full name for
     the report?

          HARRY
     Oh, please!

          BARNES
     Oh, man!

          TED
     We're not alone.  We are definitely not
     alone.  Harry, it's trying to make
     contact with us.

          HARRY
     Whatever it is, it was inside that
     Sphere, now it's out, and free to act.

          TED
     What do you mean by that?

          HARRY
     Free to take over our computers...free to
     call us on the phone, free to come over
     and knock on the door if it wants to.

          TED
     A physical presence.

          BARNES
     What are you thinking about, Norman?

          NORMAN
     This last part.  Where he says, 'I am
     happy.'

          HARRY
     What's the matter, Norman?  Don't you
     want Jerry to be happy?

          NORMAN
     Honestly?

          BARNES
     What's on your mind, Norman?

          NORMAN
     I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions
     whatsoever. Because the thing of it is,
     once you go down that road -- here's
     Jerry, this emotional being, cooped up
     for three hundred years with no one to
     talk to, none of the socialization, the
     emotional growth that comes from contact
     with other emotional beings...

          HARRY
     Yeah?

          NORMAN
     What happens if Jerry gets mad?

An exchange of looks all around.

INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Ted fixes coffee. Barnes and Harry sit at the table. Ted
brings the coffee to the table, slides one to Barnes. Then
Beth enters, approaches Ted with sheaf of papers.

          BETH
     You have to look at this.

          TED
     What?

          BETH
     There's a record here of a transmission
     to the surface.  Just before the
     submarine was due to pick us up.

          BARNES
     Let me take a look at that.

Beth debates turning it over to him.  Barnes gives Beth a
sardonic look, takes the page and reads it...

BARNES' POV - INSERT

as he reads the transmission...

"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain
down for duration of storm to continue investigation."

BACK TO SCENE

Barnes thinks a beat.  Then smiles his Cheshire cat grin.

          BARNES
         (humoring her)
     But Beth, we never elected to remain.  We
     elected to return.

          BETH
     Exactly.

          TED
     Who sent the message?

          BETH
     The signature is encoded. Remember what
     happened?  The submarine was coming but
     Edmunds said she wasn't getting a
     reading. But the truth is, the submarine
     was never coming.
         (looking at Barnes)
     Somebody told it not to come.

          BARNES
     What are you saying -- you think it was
     me?

          BETH
     Was it?

          BARNES
     I don't know, Beth -- maybe it was Jerry.

          BETH
     Jerry doesn't know the code.  And he
     can't read minds.

          BARNES
          (chuckling)
     Maybe he can.  Maybe he can read minds.

          BETH
     It had to be you or Edmunds or Fletcher --
     you're the only ones who knew the codes.

          BARNES
     And there's no place else this message
     could have come from? Like maybe you made
     it up?

Beth looks at Barnes.  Turns to Harry.

          BETH
     Harry, you think we're going to die down
     here.  How?  They told us we'd be safe.
     Who wants us to die?

          HARRY
         (shrugs)
     I don't know.

          TED
     It's not Barnes, Beth.  It's jellyfish
     and God knows what.

          BETH
     Don't you see what's going on?  He wanted
     us to stay down here.

          TED
     I wanted to stay down here all along.

          BETH
     But he said we were going back. Why did
     he lie?  Why did he send the submarine
     back?

Ted shrugs.  Goes back to making his coffee.  Barnes
grins his enigmatic grin.


          BARNES
     You sure are a lot of woman.  I wish I
     could've seen you in the old days.  From
     what Norman tells me you were quite...

Barnes lets it hang there.  He and Beth exchange a look.

          BETH
     What did Norman tell you?

          BARNES
     Let's put it this way.  If Jerry could
     read your mind, he'd sure be bored with
     ours.

Beth looks at Barnes.  In an instant she knows that Norman
betrayed her.  She exchanges a look with the others -- do
they also know?  Then she miles.

          BETH
     Okay.  So that's how it's gonna be then.

As they hurry toward Edmunds... Norman reaches her first. As
he grabs her, her body swivels and he sees --

EDMUNDS' FACE

Smeared inside her squashed helmet... Norman loses his
grip... As he slips, Edmunds' boot hits his glass face plate.
As he struggles to get away, Edmunds' boot slides off,
revealing a pulpy, enpurpled foot. Containing his nausea, he
grabs Edmunds...

          BARNES (V/O)
         (on intercom)
     Norman...is everything alright out there?

As she moves to help Norman with Edmunds, she grabs Edmunds'
foot... Shocked as her fingers sink into it... She reaches up
to feel Edmunds' ankle, her shin...

     My God, Norman, she's like a rag doll.
     Her body's been completely pulverized.

Norman and Beth turn, hauling Edmunds toward the habitat.

Then a single luminous, glossy white ball, about the size of
a baseball, falls slowly through the water between them...
like the pearl in the Prell ad...

     sonar.  You're not alone out there.

BACK ON NORMAN AND BETH

Beth around her... Turns to Norman.

          BETH
     What the hell makes eggs this size?

The eggs surround them.

          BETH (cont'd)
         Come on, Norman!  Jesus, Norman let's go!

          NORMAN
         Alright!  Alright!  Alright.....!

          BARNES  (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Eighty yards and closing!  Move!

BACK ON NORMAN AND BETH

As they run with Edmunds' body... Stumbling through the
sticky eggs as they pile high on the ocean bottom... The
PONG... PONG... PONG... audible over the intercom...

          NORMAN
     What the hell is it?

          BARNES (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Sixty yards... how close are you?

          NORMAN
     I can't breathe.

          BETH
     Oh, my God!

          BETH
     Norman, you're going the wrong way.

          BARNES (V.O.)
     Forty yards...Move!  Move!  Move!  Move!
     Move!!

          BETH
     We can't see anything through the eggs.

          BARNES (V.O.)
     Move! Twenty yards...Move! Move!
         (beat)
     Whatever it is, it's directly overhead.

NORMAN'S POV - THROUGH FACEPLATE

THROUGH a heavy fog of condensation, Norman sees a shaft of
light coming down through the airlock... Eggs falling
everywhere... Norman breathing heavily...

Then suddenly hands grab Norman... and pull him up to safety.

INT. HABITAT MOON POOL - SAME TIME

As Barnes yanks Norman inside, passes him to Harry, who help
him to get out of his suit, swaddle him in a blanket...
Barnes reaches down again and pulls Beth aboard... Then turns
as Edmunds' squashed head bobs up through the opening.
Grimly, Barnes reaches down, pulls Edmunds' body aboard.

          BARNES
     I need a report, Beth.

          BETH
     I don't know what the hell's going on out
     there...there's eggs everywhere.

          BARNES
     You should have brought one back.

          BETH
     I wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt. Maybe
     that's what Edmunds was doing. Did you
     get anything on the sonar?

          BARNES
     Whatever it is, it's too big for the
     sonar.

Norman shivers in his blanket. The distant PONG... PONG...
PONG... of the sonar in the video room, audible over the
intercom.  Then it suddenly GROWS SOFTER.  And STOPS.

          TED
         (over intercom)
     It's gone.

Scared looks all around.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

As he shivers...

          NORMAN
     I want to talk to Jerry.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HABITAT - CORRIDORS TO VIDEO ROOM - LATER

Norman leads the others through the corridors toward the
video room.

          BARNES
     I think we need a game plan when we talk
     to him.

          HARRY
     We need to be specific.  What is our
     objective? What do we want to address?
     Specifics.

Barnes goes first into the video room.

INT. VIDEO ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The others file in behind Barnes.  A message awaits on the
computer...

          THE SPHERE
         (on computer)
     WHAT IS A GAME PLAN?

BACK ON TEAM

          BARNES
     Oh, my God!

As Norman gapes at the screen.  The others edge in closer,
gape also.  Is it possible?

          NORMAN
     Jesus!
         (beat)
     Jerry? Jerry, can you hear me?

          THE SPHERE
         (types on computer)
     YES, NORMAN.

          NORMAN
     You've heard everything we've been
     talking about?

          THE SPHERE
     YES, NORMAN.

          BARNES
     Oh, great.

          THE SPHERE
     I AM HAPPY ALSO.

          TED
     Jerry, hi, this is Ted here. You know,
     I'm the guy who actually de-coded the
     keyboard thing that you.....

          BARNES
     Shut up! Tell him we need to discuss this
     together.  Alone.

          NORMAN
     Jerry....

          THE SPHERE
     IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO STOP.  I DO
     NOT WISH IT.

          BARNES
     Well, it's necessary to me.

          THE SPHERE
     NO.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE.  I DON'T
     AGREE.  NO!

ANGLE ON SCREEN

As a series of "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO" unspools across the
entire screen...

          NORMAN
     Jerry, use your words.  He's mad.  Jerry,
     use your words.

          BARNES
     Just pull his plug.

          NORMAN
     I'm not sure it's that simple, sir.

          BARNES
     It's plenty simple.  We leave him alone,
     he leaves us alone.

          NORMAN
     Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.
     He's been down here in isolation for
     three hundred years. Maybe Jerry is
     lonely.

          BARNES
     Lonely?  That's like saying an artichoke
     is lonely.

          NORMAN
         (whispering)
     He hears everything we're saying.

          BARNES
     It's just a figure of speech.

          NORMAN
     Tell him.  Tell Jerry.

          THE SPHERE
     I WANT TO TALK.  NOW.  NOW.  RIGHT
     NOW.  NOW.

Then suddenly the SONAR lights up... PONG... PONG...PONG..

          NORMAN
     Jerry, someone wants to talk to you.

          BARNES
     I'm not talking to a television.

          NORMAN
     I think that's more than a television.

Beth enters.

          BETH
     What's that?

Barnes moves to the console.  Pushes buttons and turns
dials...

          BARNES
     Sonar.  It's picking something up out
     there.

          NORMAN
     Jerry, we all find you a fascinating and
     wonderful entity.  And we wish to talk to
     you for many, many hours, Jerry -- you
     know that.

          THE SPHERE
     I DON'T WANT TO STOP.  NO.

PONG... PONG... PONG... Getting LOUDER and more frequent...

          NORMAN
     In your great understanding and wisdom,
     Jerry, you must understand that entities
     such as ourselves need to talk alone
     sometimes.

          THE SPHERE
     ARE YOU AFRAID?

          NORMAN
     No, Jerry, we're not afraid. We're just a
     little uncomfortable.

          THE SPHERE
     HAVE I OFFENDED YOU?

          NORMAN
     You're tops in our books, Jerry. It's
     just the way we're built, that's all.

          THE SPHERE
     DO NOT BE AFRAID.

ANGLE ON SCREEN

As it goes blank.  PONG!... PONG!... PONG.'...

          NORMAN
     Jerry?
         (beat)
     Goddammit!

          BETH
     Where did he go?

Then Barnes turns suddenly alert.  He moves to adjust a
couple of knobs beneath the gas plasma readouts on the
console.  Pulls on the headphones...

          HARRY
     What's going on?

          BARNES
     Something's clogging everything up out
     there.

Beth goes to the porthole.

          BETH
     Norman, come here!

Norman joins her...

THEIR POV - ON MONITOR

Thousands of eggs on the monitor, like the ones they saw
earlier, falling through the water, streaking mucus...

Some of the eggs stick to the window, then more, till their
view is obliterated...

          BETH (O.S.)
     It's back.

ANGLE ON BARNES

As he works furiously at the console... Turns to Ted.

          BARNES
     Positive thermals on in-line perimeter.

They hear a distant METALLIC CLANK...

          BETH
     What was that?

          BARNES
     It's hitting the grid.

          BETH
     Don't we have any defenses?

          BARNES
     High voltage.  We can run it across the
     surface of the Habitat.  Every time we've
     tested it it's started an electrical
     fire.

Suddenly red lights and an ALARM...

          BARNES (cont'd)
     Peripheral sensors activated.  I'm going
     to try and image it on the fast acting
     sonar.

PONG!... PONG!... PONG!...

ANGLE ON SCREEN

As Barnes looks at it... An amorphous, streaky blob...

          BARNES
     Building image... Eighty yards and moving
     fast...

ANGLE ON SCREEN

A new image, not a lot sharper... A blob with streaks
spraying out from the center...

          BETH
     Can you tell what it is?

          TED
     My God, it's forty feet long.

          BARNES
     Fifty yards.
         (off sonar)
     Re-imaging.

ANGLE ON MONITORS

A blurred mass and a spray of what might be tentacles fanning
out from the center...

          BETH
     It looks like a giant squid.

          TED
     A giant squid the size of this entire
     habitat?  There's no such animal.

          BETH
     That may be, but that doesn't mean it's
     not out there.

          BARNES
     Re-imaging.  Thirty yards.

Another slightly clearer image... It sure looks like a
squid... On the video surveillance, blurred images -- a
tentacle ringed with suckers, an eye -- too close and too
fast to make out.  Then suddenly, all the monitors and
sensors go blank.

          TED
     What's going on?

          NORMAN
     Jerry...Jerry...Jerry...if you can hear
     me, it's Norman.  If we've made you
     angry, or if you're upset about
     anything...

          BARNES
     Norman, you're psycho-analyzing a
     toaster.
         (looking at control monitor)
     Oh, we've got a pressure drop.  Ted, go
     into the control room. Wait there for my
     instructions.

          TED
     Why?

          BARNES
     Just go, please!

Ted exits at a run... Then they hear a METALLIC CLANKING...

          NORMAN
     What's that sound?  What is that?

          BARNES
     It sounds like he's right above us.

          NORMAN
     I know where it is, but what is it?

Then suddenly the MONITORS FLASH ON...

          THE SPHERE

          BARNES
     Alright, Ted, listen to me carefully.
     The computer's showing we've got
     structural damage.  We've got seams
     compromised, and we're taking on water
     all over the habitat.  You've got to
     increase the positive air pressure and
     drive the water out, do you understand
     that?

          TED
     Increase the pressure? Won't that use up

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     Ted, you're a smart guy, try to follow
     this one.  If the Habitat is full of
     water, you'll be dead.  Now, open the red
     gate valve.

          TED
     Don't get technical with me, Barnes.
     What's a gate valve?

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     It's a red knob.

          TED
     Good.  I can understand knobs. Er...which
     knob?

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     Ted, the pressure is dropping.  It is
     dropping, Ted!  We'll be crushed like a
     tin can!  Find the red knob, Ted!  It's
     the only one in the room.  It's over the
     console.

          TED
     Which console?

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     It's the one with the schematics on it,
     you cretin.  What do you have a Ph.D
     for?!

Ted looks for the knob.

          TED
     Layout...layout...layout...layout. Bad
     time not to have my glasses.  Shit!

Then he finds it.

          TED (cont'd)
     Got it!

          BARNES
         (over intercom)
     Turn it counter-clockwise right away.
     Alright, good. We're getting positive
     pressure.  Alright, not too much now.
     Start to ease it back.

     Over here...there's one there.

asleep.  Snoozing like a baby in his bunk.  Ted takes a beat -

          NORMAN
     Yes...yes....okay.

He gets up, moves toward the door.

NORMAN'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

The Pilot and Seaman from earlier scenes, in full dress
uniform, stand guard across the corridor. Norman opens the
door.

          NORMAN
     Thank God you guys are here.

          SEAMAN
     Yes, sir.

          NORMAN
     It's been like a nightmare...the
     fire...Ted's dead, and the fire got out
     of control.  We did what we could.

          PILOT
     Yes, sir.  Just follow us.

Norman walks between the Pilot and the Seaman.

     Yes, sir.

          NORMAN
     Are we leaving now?

          SEAMAN
     Yes, sir.

          NORMAN
     When did you guys get here?

          SEAMAN
     Just now, sir.

          NORMAN
     And do the others know yet?

          PILOT
     The others, sir?

          NORMAN
     The others.  There's three of us
     left...Harry and Beth.  We've had a rough
     time.

          PILOT
     I can see that, sir.

          NORMAN
     Rough time...So, shouldn't we go and get
     them?

          SEAMAN
     Yes, sir.

          NORMAN
     When?

The Seaman and Pilot walk away.  Norman stands alone in the
corridor.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     When? When? When do we get 'em? When?
     When we do we get 'em? When are we gonna
     get 'em? When?

INT. VIDEO ROOM

Norman is asleep and wakes himself up with the same refrain.

          NORMAN
     When are we gonna get 'em...? Get
     'em...when?  When?

He sits up straight in his chair, looks around - nobody
there.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Jerry?

     Jerry, it's Norman.  Is that you, Jerry?

Norman moves closer to the monitors...

ANGLE ON SURVEILLANCE MONITORS

Norman sets about flipping switches -- different views
and angles, some flooded and sealed off, all deserted...

          NORMAN
     I don't know, Jerry.  I just woke up.  Do
     you know where he is?

          THE SPHERE
     HE WAS NOT FRIENDLY.  HE DID NOT
     ENJOY TO TALKING WITH ME.

          NORMAN
     I know.  He's a difficult entity
     sometimes.  Can you tell me what happened
     to him, Jerry?

          THE SPHERE
     I DO NOT SENSE THE ENTITY TED.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

          NORMAN
     I know. Something happened to Ted, Jerry.

          THE SPHERE
     BRING HIM BACK.

          NORMAN
     I can't.

          THE SPHERE
     BRING BACK THE ENTITY TED.  HE WAS
     HUMOROUS.

          NORMAN
     I can't do that, Jerry.  It's not in my
     power.
         (beat)
     There was a fire and I froze.  I didn't
     help him.  I wanted to, but I didn't help
     him.  I knew him since he was seventeen
     years old and I let him go.
         (beat)
     Okay, but I'd like to just deal with this
     at a later time.  So, do you want to tell
     me about the others?

          THE SPHERE
     DID YOU LIKE THE GIANT SQUID?

          NORMAN
     You made that, Jerry?

          THE SPHERE
     DO YOU LIKE IT?  I CAN MANIFEST IT
     MORE FOR YOU.

          NORMAN
     No, no.  Don't do that.  Nothing more
     right now, thanks.

          THE SPHERE
     I DO NOT WISH TO STOP.

ANGLE ON MONITORS

As Norman punches a view of the galley... Harry placidly eats
a sandwich and reads a book... Then Norman resumes punching
up other views of the habitat...

          NORMAN
     You see, the problem is, Jerry, your
     manifestations injure our entities. And
     pretty soon, there'll be no entities to
     play with, and you'll be all alone again.
     All because you can't control yourself.
     Because with all your power you don't
     have the power to stop, do you, Jerry.

A long beat as Norman waits for a response.  Then:

          THE SPHERE
     STOP CALLING ME JERRY.

          NORMAN
     What name do you want? Jerry...Jerry.
     What name do you want? Jerry...

Norman waits.  No response.

INT. CAFETERIA - SAME TIME

Harry munches on his sandwich and reads his book -- 20,000
LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.  Norman enters.

     Hey, Harry.  How you doin'?

          HARRY
         (looks up)
     Norman.

          NORMAN
         Wow, can you believe what happened?

          HARRY
         What?

          NORMAN
         You know.  The attack on the habitat?
         (off Harry's look)
     You know there was an attack on this
     place?

          HARRY
     I must've slept through it.

          NORMAN
     You slept through it.

          HARRY
         (yawns)
     I was dead tired.

          NORMAN
     It's a good thing you don't have a living
     will, Harry.  We would've had to have
     given all your organs away.

Harry laughs.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     So the smoke didn't bother you? All the
     leaking...you know...

          HARRY
         (with book)
     Did you ever read this? Twenty Thousand
     Leagues Under the Sea? I found it in the
     john -- probably somebody's misguided
     attempt at levity.  I always loved this
     book. I could never get past page eighty-
     seven, though.  Too scary.

          NORMAN
     You seem to be, uh, strangely detached,
     Harry.  Given our predicament.

          HARRY
     I dunno, Norman. With all your panic and
     running around, what have you
     accomplished?

Norman looks at Harry's unnerving, serene smile.  Then eases
back into the corridor, looks up and down for Beth...

          NORMAN
     You knew I was running around?
         (beat)
     Have you, uh, seen Beth?

          HARRY
         (shrugs)
     No, I thought she was with the others.

          NORMAN
     What others?  Barnes and Ted are dead,
     Harry.
         (off Harry's look)
     There's nobody down here who knows how to
     run the place anymore.  The fire screwed
     up the electronics. We've used up most of
     our reserve gas...you're reading your
     book...

Harry is saddened by the news of Barnes and Ted. Then his
gloom lifts suddenly.

          HARRY
     Look on the bright side, Norman.

          NORMAN
     What's that?

          HARRY
     With Barnes and Ted dead, we don't need
     as much gas. And with half this place
     flooded, we don't have to worry about
     filling that space with gas either.

          NORMAN
     That's a helluva bright side, Harry.

          HARRY
     It is what it is.

Suddenly Beth hustles inside.  Heads for the refrigerator
for a bottle of water...

          BETH
     Somebody has to go reset the minisub.  If
     we don't reset it every twelve hours it
     floats to the surface.  Remember?

          HARRY
     I'll go.

          NORMAN
         (quickly)
     No, no.  I'll go.

          HARRY
     You sure?

          NORMAN
     Yeah.

          BETH
     It might be our only way out of here.

          HARRY
         (brightly)
     See, there's another bright side, Norman.

          NORMAN
     Yeah?

          HARRY
     With Barnes and Ted dead -- the minisub
     only holds three people!

Norman looks at Harry, grinning at him.

          NORMAN
     Beth, could I talk to you for a second?

Norman grabs Beth and hurries her out of the galley. Harry
returns to reading his book.

                              CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDORS - LATER

Beth and Norman head toward the moon pool.

          NORMAN
     I don't want Harry anywhere near that
     minisub.

          BETH
     You think he'll leave without us?

          NORMAN
     Oh, I think he's already left without us.
     I think Harry's in a whole 'nother place.
         (beat)
     Did you know he slept through the attack?
     You don't think that's a little strange?

A beat between them as Beth considers this...

          BETH
     Well, I guess it's me and you, Norman.
     Just like I said at the beginning.  It's
     good I have someone down here I can
     trust.

          NORMAN
         (smiling)
     You and me Beth.

          BETH
     You'd better get going.  I'm not sure how
     much time we have.  I'll keep an eye on
     you from the control room.
         (beat)
     And Norman...it's not like swimming, it's
     walking.

Norman smiles.

Norman splashes down out of the air lock.  Walks out from

Norman starts out toward the minisub...

INT. SUB DOME HANGAR/INT. MINI-SUB - LATER

The minisub rocks gently, as if someone's clambering on top
of it.  Then the hatch opens... And Norman drops down inside.
He hums as he situates himself in the cockpit.

ANGLE ON CONSOLE

As Norman's hands run over the controls...

          NORMAN
         (mutters to himself)
     Reset... Reset...

Then, up above the dashboard, he finds a flashing red button
marked "TIMER HOLE" beside a digital clock that's running
down... Norman presses it and a small screen glows...

TIMER RESET -- COUNT:  12:00:00

It starts counting down... Norman smiles with
satisfaction.

EXT. SUB DOME HANGAR - SAME TIME

Norman plunges back into the water...

NORMAN'S POV - THROUGH FACEPLATE

Of the habitat in the distance... Then the faceplate starts
to fog up... Norman's view is a little woozy... Then he LOOKS
DOWN at his gas hose as bubbles slowly start leaking out.

          NORMAN (O.S.)
     Beth, something's happened to my hose.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

He fumbles, all thumbs with gloves, his faceplate
fogged...trying to tighten the valve where bubbles are coming
from.  Instead, he loosens it, and more bubbles are released.

          NORMAN
     Beth, I've got bubbles coming out.
         (beat)
     Beth!

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

Of the habitat, the nimbus of the lights THROUGH the fog of
the FACEPLATE.  It looks really far away.

          NORMAN
     Beth, can you tell me what to do.  It's
     fogging me all up here.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

He looks like he's running in place and getting nowhere...

His feet slipping on the silty bottom...

          NORMAN
     Beth, there's something wrong here.  I've
     got to get out of here...I've got to get
     out of here.  Where the hell are you!

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

Thoroughly fogged now... Norman stomping blindly through the
ocean, his BREATHING panicked, the INDICATORS BLEEPING in
alarm... Then suddenly Harry breaks in over the intercom.

BACK TO SCENE

          HARRY (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Hey, watch out for that rock.  It's me,
     Harry.

          NORMAN
     Harry...

          HARRY (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Come around the rock... go to the right of
     the stanchion.

          NORMAN
     Harry, I'm hurting.  Come around which
     way?  I can't breathe Harry...

          HARRY (V.O.)
         (matter-of-fact)
     Yes, you can.  You just have a loose
     valve. It's not gonna kill you.  You've
     got plenty of gas.  Can you see the
     airlock?  It's right in front of you.

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

Heavily fogged, he can dimly MAKE OUT the shaft of light
coming down from the airlock.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

as he stumbles toward the airlock... then his indicator
flatlines...Norman looks down at his loose gas hose...

INSERT - GAS HOSE

No more bubbles...no more gas.

BACK ON NORMAN

In a total panic, holding his breath.

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

The fogged glass and murky water... Can't see...

BACK ON NORMAN

thrashing through the water...

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

As he swims furiously, he sees the light from the moon pool
and the ladder leading down, right in front of him... he
grabs for the rungs of the ladder... it's a...

SEA SNAKE

The sea SNAKE HISSES, then snaps at Norman as Norman lets go,
falls to the ocean bottom...

NORMAN'S POV THROUGH FACEPLATE

As the snake swipes at his face, its forked tongue smearing
slime across the faceplate... then the snake scurries away
as...

Grab Norman and pull him up to safety...

          HARRY
     Try and relax your breathing. You're
     gonna hyperventilate.

          NORMAN
     Where is she?  She said she'd...keep an
     eye out for me.

          HARRY
     I looked through the whole habitat, I
     couldn't find her.  I thought maybe she
     was with you.

          NORMAN
     Where is she? Where is she?

Norman looks over... we follow his gaze...

ANGLE ON BETH'S LOCKER

He and Harry exchange a look.

          NORMAN
         (whispering)
     Did she tell you she was going out?

Then Norman addresses the mike.

     Beth?

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Norman? I can't hear you.

          NORMAN
         (to Harry)
     If she can't hear me, why did she answer?
     Beth, what are you doing?

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     I went out looking for food. We're out
     of food.

Harry covers the mike with his hand.

          HARRY
     There's plenty of food.  I was just in
     there.

Norman and Harry exchange a look.

          NORMAN
     You went to look for food in the
     spacecraft? That seems a little odd,
     don't you think?

INTERCUT WITH:

BETH

As she walks toward the habitat...

          BETH
     Why, what's odd about it?

          NORMAN
         If there was food? Beth, uh -- wouldn't
         it be three hundred years old?

          BETH
         I was hoping our luck would change and
         I'd find a cryogenic freezer. Or a bottle
         of bordeaux.

          HARRY
         She's lying.
         (off Norman's look)
         Norman, she's lying about everything.

          BETH
         Is Harry there, Norman?

          NORMAN
         Why don't we just talk when you get back?
         Meet me in the galley. We'll have a cup
         of coffee.
         (charming)
         We still have coffee, don't we?

          BETH
         Very funny.  I'll take mine black, like
         my mood.

          NORMAN
         All right. See you soon.

Norman turns off the microphone. Turns to Harry.

          HARRY
         Norman, what we have here are two
         ingredients -- Beth and this underwater
         environment... you put them together and
         you've got one big ass bomb.

          BETH
     How'd it go with the mini-sub?

          NORMAN
     It was a little disconcerting out there,
     actually.

          BETH
     Oh?

          NORMAN
     Weren't you supposed to be watching out

     Harry said he'd take over for me.
         (off Harry's look)
     He sat down right in front of the
     monitors and -- Norman, what happened?

          NORMAN
     I was in trouble. Where the hell were
     you?

          BETH
     What's going on, Norman?

          NORMAN
     All I know is, going out to find food in
     the spacecraft when there's plenty of
     food here isn't exactly normal.

          BETH
     What do you mean, plenty of food? I was
     just here.  There's nothing in the --

Beth goes to the cupboards, opens them.

ANGLE ON OPEN CUPBOARDS

Spilling over with food... Beth takes a beat to size up the
situation -- she can sense their eyes on her.

          HARRY
     A veritable horn of plenty.

          BETH
     He must've hidden it.

          HARRY
     You think I hid all this food?

          BETH
     I don't know what's going on here, but
     twenty minutes ago I was standing right
     here and there was no food in the
     cupboards and no food in the
     refrigerator.

          NORMAN
     Why, Beth? Why would Harry do that?  Why
     would he set you up?

          BETH
     I don't know what happened.  All I know
     is this food wasn't here.

          HARRY
     Paging Dr. Halperin.  Please report to
     reality.  Dr. Halperin?

          BETH
     Shut up!
         (to Norman)
     Okay, you can see what he's doing to me.

          NORMAN
     You were supposed to be watching, Beth.
     That's the facts.  You think Harry said
     something he didn't.  That the cupboards
     are empty when they're full...Clinically,
     we would call that a psychotic break.

          BETH
     I'm not crazy, Norman. What're you gonna
     do? Write me a prescription? Just get
     rid of me? Well, it's not that
     convenient down here, Norman, okay.  I am
     not psychotic.

          NORMAN
     What about a mini-psychotic break.

          BETH
     It's not fair.

          NORMAN
     Beth.

          BETH
     What?

          NORMAN
     Beth, I'm down there...I'm
     hyperventilating, I can't breathe...I'm
     hyperventilating.  The man saved me!

          BETH
     But I....

          NORMAN
     Wait a minute.  Now you want me to
     believe that the man set me up.  Why?
     This isn't 'Alice in Wonderland'.
     Remember 'just you and me babe'? Is it
     unrealistic to think that at this point
     you are a danger to yourself - you are a
     danger to us...that your misguided anger
     towards me for something that I don't
     know what it was that happened decades
     ago is spewing out like poison.  I was
     out there.  You almost got me killed.
     The man tried to save my life!  You now
     want me to disbelieve Harry?

          BETH
     Yes, I want you to disbelieve Harry.  I
     want you to look at me and believe me for
     one time, Norman. Don't you...? Just
     look at me, Norman! Am I telling you the
     truth?

          NORMAN
     You weren't there, Beth.

          BETH
     You want to believe Harry, Norman, then
     that's fine, because he's done everything
     but part the sea for you since we've been
     down here, but I'm telling you that he is
     not telling you the truth.

          NORMAN
     This is not about Harry, okay?

          BETH
         (right back)
     He didn't tell you what's inside The
     Sphere.
         (to Harry)
     You didn't tell him, did you?  You didn't
     tell him what's inside the Sphere, did
     he?

An exchange of looks all around.

          HARRY
     And how would you know that, Beth?

Norman looks at Beth.

          NORMAN
     Beth, did you go inside The Sphere?

Beth smiles enigmatically.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Answer me.  Did you go inside the Sphere?

Beth just looks at him.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Why won't you answer me, Beth?  It's a
     question.

          BETH
     You don't want to talk to me, remember?

          NORMAN
     Answer the question.

She gives him a hard look. Then walks out.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     What do you think, Harry. Do  you think
     she went into the Sphere?

Harry says nothing.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Here.  You dropped your book.

Norman picks up the book of "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" to
hand to Harry, but sees that he's still reading the book.

Norman thinks a beat.  Then opens a cupboard to reveal rows
and rows of books of "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" arranged
neatly inside.

Puzzled and scared, Norman opens another cupboard - more
copies of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea...row after row of
books...

BACK ON NORMAN

His fear accelerating... struggling to think, to put the
pieces together...

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - LATER

Norman broods alone... Then he turns to the monitors...

          NORMAN
     What isn't Harry telling me? I know
     you're there, Jerry. What's inside the
     Sphere, Jerry?  Jerry, I know you're
     there.  You're always there.
         (beat)
     Harry is reading this book "20,000
     Leagues Under The Sea".  What makes me
     nervous is that after page 87...
         (he ruffles through the book)
     ...it's all blank pages.  Harry's
     upstairs sitting in the cafeteria reading
     blank pages.  Why? Why did he go into
     the Sphere and come out like this? Why?
     Why? Why, Jerry? Why is this book half
     a book, Jerry? Why? What's going on,
     Jerry?  Why, Jerry? Why? Why? Why?

No response.

Then Norman turns back to 87.  Reads...

JUMP CUT

BACK ON NORMAN

as he works out the code of Jerry's original message with a
pencil...

          NORMAN
     So, it's 'g' being one spiraling out from
     the center and 2 is 'b', that means that
     h' is 3 and 4 then is 'y'.

He completes the sentence: "My Name Is Harry." A piece of
the puzzle may be in place.  He goes back to the dormitory to
check on Harry.

INT. DORMITORY - SAME TIME

THROUGH the Porthole in the door, Norman looks in on Harry
who is still thoroughly engrossed in 20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea.

                              CUT TO:

INT. ENGINE ROOM - LATER

The noise of the various PUMPS and COMPRESSORS... Norman,
his nerves frayed, juggles a copy of 20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea, the printout and the pad as he confers with Beth.

          NORMAN
     He makes it real for you, he makes it
     real for me...he has made it real for
     everybody.  It's really frightening
     because you don't know whether it's
     really real or whether he's made it real
     for us to believe it's real, and it's
     because of the Sphere.

          BETH
     Our Harry... our Harry is Jerry?

          NORMAN
     Come on, Beth, I'm just as tired as you
     are.  Come on, I know you can get this,
     okay?  Here.

He hands her a copy of "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea".

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
     because he said it was too scary, okay.

          BETH
     If there's nothing on the pages, where's
     the rest of the book.

          NORMAN
     Read what's on page 87.

          BETH
         (reading)
     '... According to calculations of some
     naturalists, one of these animals, only
     six feet long, would have tentacles
     twenty-seven feet long.  That would make
     a formidable monster.'
         (closes book)

          NORMAN
     Yes.  And what does Harry hate?

          BETH
     Squid.

          NORMAN
     And when he read that, it scared him.
     Getting the picture?  Do you remember
     when all those jellyfish attacked.  What
     was Harry doing?

          BETH
     Sleeping.

          NORMAN
     He was dreaming, and this is the really
     wild part - what he dreamed....

          BETH
     Happened.

          NORMAN
     It happened.

          BETH
     You're telling me that because Harry went
     inside the Sphere, he now has the power
     to manifest his dreams, his fantasies,
     his emotions, his fears.

          NORMAN
     Manifest.  He manifested it...he made it
     happen.

          BETH
     Well, we'd better not piss him off.

INT. DORMITORY - CLOSE ON HARRY - SAME TIME

Still reading "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea".  Then he stares
into space.

                              CUT TO:

INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth and Norman still figuring things out.

          NORMAN
     It's like an E-ticket ride for Harry's
     subconscious.  It's the wildest ride you
     could imagine.  It's the ultimate acting
     out.  It's not that different when you're
     a child.  A child when it imagines
     something, thinks that it's real, but
     it's not.
     In Harry's case, it's in fact so real
     that it's not only real to Harry it's
     real to all of us...and what I can't
     understand is that ever since he went in
     the Sphere, the Sphere has some kind of
     power that projects every subconscious
     thought that Harry has, out to the
     computer. It prints it out, and we
     interact with it.  We thought it was
     Jerry.  It's not Jerry, it's Harry.
     Harry's Jerry.

          BETH
     Does Harry know this?

          NORMAN
     No, and what I don't understand is that
     you went in The Sphere and nothing
     happened.

          BETH
     'Cos with my subconscious, can you just
     imagine?  It'd be like Liquid Drano out
     there.

          NORMAN
     But nothing happened.

          BETH
     Obviously I didn't go in the Sphere.

          NORMAN
     Beth.  You never went inside the Sphere.
     You didn't go in there?

          BETH
     I was so angry at you, I wanted you to be
     scared.

          NORMAN
     Maybe you had a right to be.

          BETH
     Thanks.

Norman looks at her.

          NORMAN
     You're sure you didn't go in there?

Beth thinks a long beat.

          BETH
     We have to kill Harry.

          NORMAN
     No, no.  We don't have to kill Harry.

          BETH
     Yeah, we do.

          NORMAN
     Why?

          BETH
     Because, I don't know about you, Norman,
     but I don't feel like dying down here.

          NORMAN
     We don't have to kill him.  We just have
     to find something to put him under,
     right?  So he's in some kind of deep,
     unconscious sleep.

          BETH
     Dreamless sleep, I hope.

          NORMAN
     A dreamless sleep, yes. How do we do
     that?

          BETH
     Well, I've got a bunch of drugs up there.

          NORMAN
     Fancy that.

INT. LAB - LATER

Norman and Beth fumble through the habitat's pharmacy...

          NORMAN
     Diphenyl paralene.

          BETH
     Burns.

          NORMAN
     Ephedrine hydrochloride.

          BETH
     Motion sickness.

          NORMAN
     Valdomet.

          BETH
     Ulcers. You might want to keep that.

          NORMAN
     Sintag.

          BETH
     Sintag is a synthetic opiate. It's a
     painkiller.  I might want to keep that.

          NORMAN
     What about Parasolutrine?

          BETH
     Really?  I've got paracin trichloride -
     that's an anesthetic.

          NORMAN
     What do you do, combine it?

          BETH
         (holding up vials)
     Huh, huh.  If you've got 20 cc's of this
     one, six of this one, you're in business.

          NORMAN
         (vial in hand)
     Here's some more Parasolutrine.  Will
     that be enough?

ANGLE ON HUGE HYPODERMIC

Norman looks on as Beth fills it from the vials...

          BETH
     This'll put him under for three to six
     hours.

          NORMAN
     Can't we give him a little boost?

          BETH
     You want to kill him?

          NORMAN
     Yes and no.

                              CUT TO:

INT. DORMITORY - SAME TIME

Harry sleeps.  A shaft of light as the door opens and Beth
and Norman tiptoe in, Beth with the hypodermic.

          NORMAN
         (whispers to Beth)
     I'm gonna hold him.

They exchange a look.  Then Norman grabs Harry as Beth
plunges the needle into him.  Harry howls, more from surprise
than pain, as Beth pushes the plunger and injects him.

          HARRY
     What's going on?

          NORMAN
     Nothing.  Go back to sleep.

          HARRY
     I was asleep.

Harry's eyes roll back into his head and he falls asleep.

          BETH
     I wasn't sure it would be that fast-
     acting.  Thank God.

          NORMAN
     We didn't kill him, did we?

          BETH
     I don't think so.

          NORMAN
     Okay.

     Okay.

BACK ON BETH AND NORMAN

          BETH
          Here we go.
          NORMAN
     It's a code. How the hell are we supposed
     to be able to...oh, it's decoding itself.

ANGLE ON MONITORS

As the letters unjumble and resolve into a decoded message...

WEATHER CONDITIONS NORMAL SURFACE SUPPORT VESSELS RETURN.

ETA:  16:00:00 hours

Then the 16:00:00 begins to count down...

          BETH
     Weather conditions normal surface

     we're out of here.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

As he breaks into a smile... Turns to Beth.

          NORMAN
     It's over.  If you trust it.

          BETH
     You know me.  I believe everything.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

The sound of RUNNING WATER as Norman washes his face.
Then turns OFF the WATER.  He hears a HISS like water
leaking.  He tightens the faucets again.  Still that HISS.
Norman runs his hands along the pipes, reaches under the
sink...

INSERT - NORMAN'S HANDS

As they run beneath the sink... To where the pipe turns
into...

BELCHER'S SEA SNAKE

A wriggling white streak with a long thin fin and black
stripes...

CLOSE ON NORMAN

As he freezes... His skin goes cold and clammy... He peers
around the edge of the sink to get a look...

NORMAN'S POV - SNAKE

As it HISSES and SLURPS its forked tongue at him, bares its
fangs... Its body coiling and uncoiling...

BACK ON NORMAN

As he faces the snake... Then hears another HISS... Looks
down and sees a SECOND SNAKE coiling its way up his leg...

          NORMAN
     Aaaaargh!!!  Get out!  Get out!
     Aaaaargh!  Get out!  Get out!

Then the door opens and Beth enters.  Sees the snakes...

          BETH
     What time is it, Norman?

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH

     What time is it, Norman?

It is all Norman can do to unstick his dry mouth and reply...

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH
     Norman. What time is it?

          NORMAN
     I don't know.

     What, are you crazy!

NORMAN'S POV - LOOKING DOWN

The SNAKE around his leg HISSES and bares its fangs as Norman
slowly turns his wrist... But the crystal is fogged.

BACK TO SCENE

          BETH
     Is it day or night?

Norman thinks hard, trembling with fear...

          NORMAN
     It's day. It's morning.
         (to snakes)
     Get out!!  Get out!!!! Get out!!!!

With cat-like quickness, Beth plunges in, grabs the snakes
right behind the head... Holds them up to inspect them...

          BETH
     They're Belcher's sea snakes, Norman
     They're the most poisonous snakes in the
     world, but they're nocturnal. They're
     only dangerous at night.
         (holding up snake)
     Say "Good morning, Beth."

          NORMAN
         (weakly)
     Good morning.

Beth moves with the snakes to exit.  She turns, holding the
snakes in her hands...

          BETH (cont'd)

Norman enters.  Beth's not there  He enters further, looking
around... Looks on a notepad to see if she left a note...

Then, on the dissecting table, Norman sees something... He
moves closer...

NORMAN'S POV - DISSECTING TABLE

Alone on the table, a hypodermic needle filled with fluid...

BACK ON NORMAN

As he hears a CLICK behind him.  Turns to see that the DOOR
is now closed... The wheel spins... Norman hurries to the
door.  Can't budge it.  He locks eyes with Beth THROUGH the
porthole in the door...Then a SUCTION noise as the DOOR SEALS
SHUT... And Beth disappears.  Norman knocks on the glass.

     What are you doing?
         (beat)
     Beth? Why are you locking me in here?
     Beth!  Beth!

He looks around the lab and sees jars full of liquid on
shelves.

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Norman!  Norman!  Up here...up here.
     Norman, it's me, Beth.  I'm up here.

          NORMAN
     Why aren't you here? Why am I talking to
     you like this.

          BETH
     I'm talking to you from the video room.
     Norman, listen to me.  Turn around. Turn
     around and look on the table.

Norman turns around and sees a hypodermic needle on the
table.

          BETH
     Do you see the hypodermic needle, Norman?

          NORMAN
     Yeah.

          BETH
     I want you to inject yourself, Norman.

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH
     It's the same thing we gave Harry.  It's
     almost the same amount.

          NORMAN
     We gave that stuff to Harry because he
     was manifesting -- to make him
     unconscious.  I don't need to take that
     stuff.

     The snakes, Norman...the snakes were you.

Norman, trapped, looks at the snakes in their specimen
jars... He searches the room for a way out...

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Then how did the snakes get there,
     Norman?

          NORMAN
     Maybe they're just snakes. I mean...did
     you ever think of that?

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Pick up the needle and inject yourself.

          NORMAN
     I'm telling you, I didn't go in the
     Sphere.

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Obviously you went in the Sphere, Norman.

          NORMAN
     If I went in the Sphere I would have told
     you now.

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     If you don't use the hypodermic needle,
     I'm going to have to defend myself.
     Norman, don't make me do this.  I don't
     want to do this.

          NORMAN
     I didn't manifest anything. I didn't
     manifest anything....I didn't manifest
     anything...

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth moves a slide switch marked "A CYL--LAB"... As the gas
pressure gauge dips...

INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

There's a SOFT HISS and the ALARM BADGE on Norman's wrist pad
starts to BEEP...

          NORMAN
     Beth, what are you doing?
         (beat)

The pressure gauge begins to dip.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Beth.  Why does it say that its low
     level? Why are you taking the oxygen out
     of this room?

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom - squeaky voice)
     It's not oxygen.  It's gas, remember?

          NORMAN
     Beth, why are you taking the gas out of
     the room? Beth? It's my air...

A glass explodes.

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Think it through.  Whose childhood fears
     were the jellyfish?  Remember, Norman...
     remember?

          NORMAN
     Yes, but -- anyone could be afraid of
     jellyfish, Beth.

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Norman, look at your wrists.  Remember
     when you told me about getting burned.
     You're manifesting fire, Norman...you're
     manifesting jellyfish.  The squid were
     Harry's, but everything else is you.
     Isn't it possible that you went inside
     The Sphere and you just don't remember.

          NORMAN
     Beth, you would've seen it on the video.

          BETH
     The video blanked out and you were gone
     for two hours.  So, where were you,
     Norman?

          NORMAN
     Your logic is screwy, okay.  Because if
     I'd gone in the Sphere, I would have been
     different when I came out.  I'd have been
     strange like Harry.

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Just use the hypodermic needle, Norman.

          NORMAN
     Okay, we're not gonna have time to go
     back and forth on this.

Norman opens and closes his jaw, wiggles a finger in his ear
as his ears pop... The water level rising on the floor...
Then Norman jumps as the medicine BOTTLE BURSTS...

          NORMAN
     Beth.  What's with this water?

The bottles with liquid, now contain snakes. The bottles
explode and the snakes are released.

          NORMAN (cont'd)
     Beth...Beth...It's not me!

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     It's not me.  You're doing
     it.

          NORMAN
     Beth...Beth...oh, my God!  Beth!  Beth!

More bottles explode.

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Norman, you're manifesting this. Water
     is your fear, Norman. You said you
     hadn't been in the water since you were a
     kid.  Norman, inject yourself with the
     hypodermic needle.

          NORMAN
     Oh, my God!!

          BETH
         (over intercom)
     Norman, use the hypodermic needle.  It's
     snakes, it's fear.  You can make it go
     away, Norman.  You can make it go away.
     Pick up the hypodermic needle and inject
     yourself, Norman.

          NORMAN
     No.  I'm not going to.

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Norman, you can make it go away.

          NORMAN
     No, I'm not going to use it.  I told you,
     it's not me!  I can't breathe, Beth.

Then a BANG! as another BOTTLE EXPLODES...

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth watches Norman on the monitors.

          BETH
     Norman, I'm begging you.  Pick up the
     hypodermic needle.

INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

Water rises around Norman.

          NORMAN
     No, I'm not gonna use it.  It's not me!
     It's too late anyway! Beth...Beth...what
     are you doing? You're going to kill me!

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     I can't help you, Norman.  I'm not doing
     this.

Norman pulls himself up out of the water, hanging onto
equipment in the habitat.

          NORMAN
     Beth....!

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Try not to be so afraid, Norman.  Let go
     of your fears and it will all go
     away...and the ships will come and we'll
     all get out of here and we'll be fine.
     You're doing the right thing.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

Terrified as he watches the water rise around him...

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Just climb up.  Just get as high as you
     can get.  Try to take a deep breath,
     Norman.

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth watches as water rises in the lab...

          BETH
     Try to pull yourself together, Norman.
     Your fears are going to kill all of us.

                              CUT TO:

INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

Norman opens a cupboard and finds a first aid box...
Inside, a small gas tank with a fire mask... He breathes
deeply.

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     The oxygen in that tank will only last
     about three or four minutes.  It's not
     gonna save you, Norman.
     Just get a hold of yourself.  Take a few
     breaths.  It'll calm you down.

WIDE ANGLE - LAB

As water rises rapidly...

          NORMAN
     The water's gonna blow you out, Beth.

                              CUT TO:

INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

Norman falls into the water. Then he looks up...

NORMAN'S POV - HATCH

At the ceiling of the lab... Carrying his fire mask, Norman
climbs up on the counters...

          BETH (V.O.)
         (over intercom)
     Norman, Norman...you can stop it. Norman,
     what are you doing? Norman, don't open
     the hatch, you'll kill yourself. Norman,
     please!

He shoves hard at the lever... Shoves again and the hatch
door flies open...

WATER

explodes down into the laboratory as Norman shoots out...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

As Norman shoots out in a cloud of bubbles... The gas tank in
one hand, he grabs wildly at a steel pipe that runs along the
habitat... Without weights he has to pull hard to keep from
floating to the surface...

INSERT - NORMAN'S HAND

Purpled by the cold, as Norman pulls himself along the
pipe... Then, from below, a thick flock of jellyfish drift
out from beneath the habitat...

ANGLE ON NORMAN

In a panic, he fumbles the fire mask... Jellyfish swim past
him, brush against his flesh, his face... Norman looks
down...

NORMAN'S POV

The fire mask as it tumbles, bubbling, to the bottom... The
GAS TANK COLLIDES with the habitat WALL with a CLANK!

ANGLE ON NORMAN

Desperately, he pulls himself down, reaches for the fire
mask -- can't get it... Reaches again as it continues to
leak... His fingers clumsy from the cold... He reaches
again... And suddenly the bubbles stop...

No more gas.

CLOSE ON NORMAN

The veins bulging in his face, his neck... He uses the pipes
to pull himself under the habitat -- eyes closed against the
pain... Then his eyes flutter open and he sees the airlock...

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth watches as all the monitors go static and flash on and
off.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

Barely conscious, Norman bangs his head against the habitat
and begins to float.

WE HEAR the echoed voice of Harry.

          HARRY (V.O.)
     ....if we never told anyone, it means we
     never made it back. Hence, we die down
     here....

                              CUT TO:

INT. VIDEO ROOM - SAME TIME

Beth watches the monitors as the words we're hearing from
Harry are printed on the screens.

"WE DIE DOWN HERE.  JUST AS A MATTER OF DEDUCTIVE LOGIC."

Beth rushes out of the video room.

                              CUT TO:

INT. MOON POOL - SAME TIME

Norman bursts up into the moon pool, gulping for air...  He
clumsily pulls himself up, then slips and falls back into the
pool... flails in the water...

Then he heaves his chest over the rim and flops onto the
deck of the airlock... He peers through heavy-lidded
eyes...

NORMAN'S POV - MOON POOL ROOM DOOR

Leading inside to the habitat...

BACK ON NORMAN

He blows into his hands, trying to get warm.  Coughs through
chattering teeth... He stumbles toward the airlock door...

                              CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Beth ducks around the corner, spins the wheel of a corridor
door and it opens... But WATER SURGES in, BLASTS the door

Beth throws her body against the door, trying to close it,
but the force of the water is too strong.  She slips and
falls... The water sweeps her down the hall.  Then a huge
wave sweeps toward her, carrying --

BODY OF BARNES

Beth finds himself in a macabre embrace with Barnes'
severed torso, Barnes' face flush against her...

          BETH
     Aaaaaaaargh!

                              CUT TO:

INT. DORMITORY - CLOSE ON HARRY - SAME TIME

He wakes up with a start.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HABITAT - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Lights flicker in the hall. A DISTANT BEEP... BEEP...
BEEP...

ANGLE ON NORMAN

Wading furiously through knee-deep water like a Marine
storming a beachhead...

CLOSE ON

a limp hand knocking against the floor.  It's Beth.  She's
rolled up in a ball on the floor and is in a stupor.

          NORMAN
     Beth...Beth...Beth...

She looks up at him.

          BETH
     Norman...? Are you real?

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH
     Are you real?

          NORMAN
     Real as the water that almost killed me.
     What are you doing?

          BETH
     Part of Barnes....
         (she sobs)

          NORMAN
     What?  Part of Barnes...?

          BETH
     Part of Barnes went by me in the water.

          NORMAN
     Where?

          BETH
     Right here.

          NORMAN
     Here?

          BETH
     Here.

          NORMAN
     There's no water here.  It's dry and your
     clothes are dry.  You must have
     manifested.

          BETH
     I don't know what's real any more.

          NORMAN
     Elizabeth?

          BETH
     Huh?

          NORMAN
     You went into the Sphere, didn't you?

                              CUT TO:

INT. HABITAT - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

WE SEE the figure of Harry making his way along the corridor.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HABITAT - PREVIOUS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Beth gets up.

          NORMAN
     Beth.  Beth.  You want to answer me?

          BETH
     I don't know what to think, Norman. I
     feel like I can't breathe.

ANGLE ON HARRY watching them from a grating above them.

          BETH (cont'd)
     I can't breathe...I'm losing it, you
     know, and I'm trying...I'm trying to get
     it back...

          HARRY
     What's going on? Why did you put me out?
     Just what are you guys up to?

          NORMAN
     You went in the Sphere, Harry.  So did
     Beth, so did I...I think.

          HARRY
     And if so, what?

          NORMAN
     Whatever the Sphere is, it makes what we
     feel, real.

          HARRY
     Meaning what?

          NORMAN
     It happens.  What we're thinking, what
     we're feeling...happens.  Like those
     three astronauts in the spacecraft, Beth,
     remember? We went in there...the guy,
     the astronaut in the chair, what did you
     say about his head?

          BETH
     He had blunt force trauma.  He got hit in
     the head.

          NORMAN
     They went in the Sphere one by one, and
     they became more and more afraid of each
     other until they killed each other off,
     and we're doing the same thing.

          BETH
     I don't want to kill you, Norman.

          ALARM VOICE (V.O.)
     Your attention please.  All construction
     personnel must exit the blast area
     immediately. PANTHER explosives are now
     activated. Mark thirteen minutes and
     counting...

          HARRY
     Does somebody want to tell me what that
     voice is?

          BETH
     They had explosives down here to blast
     through the coral, so when I went out
     before, I set up a defense perimeter
     around the door of the spaceship.  You
     know, when I went to look for food,
     Harry. Something must've triggered  it.

          HARRY
     What?

          BETH
     Something from inside the Sphere.

          HARRY
     There's nothing in the Sphere, Beth.  You
     know that.  You've been inside it.

          NORMAN
     Then what?

          HARRY
     I don't know.

          NORMAN
     Then who...?

          BETH
     It's me.

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH
     Oh, God!  I was just thinking about the
     explosives...they just flashed inside my
     mind, and it must have triggered them.
     I was thinking about wanting to die.

          HARRY
     You put explosives near the spacecraft?

          BETH
     Yes, I did, but they're about a hundred
     yards away.

          HARRY
     There's a lot of liquid hydrogen left on
     that spacecraft.  If it explodes it'll
     disintegrate everything for ten miles.

          NORMAN
     What do we do?

          HARRY
     Mini-sub.  Now!

                              CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE B CYLINDER - SAME TIME

Norman, Harry and Beth hustle through the flooded corridor...

Norman, Beth and Harry, in their suits now, run toward

blink red in the distance...

In a panic, Norman moves to climb up onto the sub and

INT. MINISUB - SAME TIME

Harry drops dawn into the minisub as Norman hustles into the
driver's seat...

          BETH
     Okay, hit it!  Come on, let's go!

          NORMAN
     Wait...wait...wait...

          HARRY
     Come on!

          BETH
     Norman, let's go.

          NORMAN
     Wait, wait...it's not like I drive subs,
     Beth, okay.

          BETH
     Well, you're driving one now, honey.

ANGLE ON CONSOLE

Buttons that read:  ANGLE OF DESCENT... ANGLE OF ASCENT...
SECURE... SHUTDOWN... BALLAST... THROTTLE...

          NORMAN
     Let's see... 'Shutdown'... 'Ballast'...
     'Throttle...'

As Norman runs his fingers over the console.  Then stops.

REVERSE ANGLE - NORMAN'S FACEPLATE

Reflected there, we see the monitors of the video room...

          NORMAN
     Oh, my God!

INT. HABITAT - VIDEO ROOM - WIDER

They're back inside the video room...

          BETH
     What's going on?

          NORMAN
     I don't know.

          BETH
     Why are we inside the spaceship?

          NORMAN
     I don't know.

          ALARM VOICE (V.O.)
     Seven minutes and counting...

          HARRY
     I don't know either, guys but we don't
     have time to figure it out.  Let's get
     out of here.

They run out of the video room...to the elevator and get
inside.

          NORMAN
     It's not moving.  Anybody hit the button?
     What the hell?  Wait a minute, this was
     an elevator before, right?

          BETH
     Which one of us is doing this?

          NORMAN
     Oh, God!

They get out of the elevator and run down a corridor.

                              CUT TO:

INT. HABITAT - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Beth, Harry and Norman run down the corridor and come to a

          HARRY
     It's a dead-end.

          BETH
     Where are we?

          HARRY
     It's an illusion.

          BETH
     It doesn't look right, guys. Come on.

She leads them down another corridor.

          NORMAN
     Beth, which way?  Harry, where do we go?

          HARRY
     Where? Where's where, Norman?
     Around that corner -- down this corridor -
     - what's there, huh?

     Another blind alley in the maze of our

     He's right, Norman.

REVERSE ANGLE - TEAM TWO

BACK ON OUR TEAM who are frantically looking for a way out.

          HARRY
     Just go on. Leave me.  Leave me alone.

BACK ON SECOND TEAM

          NORMAN
         (double)
     Harry, no...no.  It's not your time,
     Harry.  Not your time.

          ALARM VOICE (V.O.)
     ... Four minutes and counting...

          BETH
     What's the point, Norman?

She shines her flashlight on the habitat floor.

          BETH (cont'd)
     Somebody's been here.

          BETH
         (double)
     There's footprints, and they ain't ours.

          NORMAN
         (double)
     Look, I don't know where we are, Beth and
     I don't know where we're stuck in.

          HARRY
     Where we are, we are...stuck in the
     illusion that we can change the future.
     It's a dead-end, Norman.

          HARRY
         (double)
     It's just like I said all along, we die
     down here.

          NORMAN
     I'm not going to die down here.

          NORMAN
         (double)
     No...no, you're not going to die down
     here.  Beth's not gonna die down here.
     I'm not gonna let you die, Harry.

They run down another corridor.

          HARRY
         (double)
     You have to push the button, Norman.

          NORMAN
     What button?

          HARRY
         (double)
     The button.  Push the button!

          NORMAN
     What button?

          BETH
         (double)
     He doesn't know.

          HARRY
     Button...the button, Norman.

          NORMAN
     I can't see the button.  I can't see the
     button.

          HARRY
         (double)
     See the button...

          NORMAN
     I can't see the button!

          HARRY
         (double)
     See the button.

          NORMAN
     I don't know what to do!

          HARRY
         (double)
     Push the button.  The button -- push the
     button.

          ALARM VOICE (V.O.)
     Two minutes and counting...

                           SMASH CUT TO:

INT. SUB DOME HANGAR/INT. MINI-SUB - EXTREME TIGHT SHOT

OF RED BUTTON - SAME TIME

as it lights up... ASCEND...

WIDER - TEAM

Inside the minisub now.  They look at each other.  Then a
RUMBLE...Harry jumps in the driver's seat - Beth and Norman
jammed in next to him, as the minisub drops down out of its
mooring... The WHIR of the ELECTRIC MOTORS STARTING...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

A high-pitched WHINE as the BALLAST TANKS FILL WITH AIR
and the minisub noses sharply up, pulls away from the
habitat...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN/INT. MINISUB - SAME TIME

Harry looks at his watch, steers the minisub while Beth
straps herself into the shotgun seat with Norman squeezed in
between the two of them.

          BETH
     Oh God.  Thank God. We're out!

          HARRY
     Don't celebrate yet.

          NORMAN
     Why not?

          HARRY
         I don't think we're moving fast enough.

          NORMAN
         Fast enough for what?

          HARRY
         A blast underwater creates a suction.
         It'll pull us right back down there.  If
         the shock wave doesn't kill us first.

Norman looks out the rear porthole...

NORMAN'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

The ring of explosive red cones with their little digital
countdown timers flashing...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. MINISUB - SAME TIME

As the minisub accelerates...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HABITAT - SAME TIME

The PANTHER explosives start to flash red as the countdown
timers rattle down...

     Attention, please.  You must exit the
     blast area immediately.  This is the last
     warning you will receive.  Thank you for
     using PANTHER brand, the first choice of
     blasting professionals, and have a nice
     day.

INSERT - COUNTDOWN TIMER

As it counts down from ten... nine... eight...

                              CUT TO:

INT. MINISUB - SAME TIME

Harry runs full throttle... Looks at the depth gauge...

          HARRY
     Six hundred forty feet...six hundred
     thirty...six twenty...six hundred ten...
         (beat)
     You a religious man, Norman?

          NORMAN
     I'm an atheist.  But I'm flexible.

INSERT - COUNTDOWN TIMER

INT. MINI-SUB

Inside the minisub... Five... four... three...

                              CUT TO:

EXT. SPACECRAFT - SAME TIME

As the countdown timer goes to zero and the EXPLOSIVES
DETONATE... A giant underwater FIREBALL...

                              CUT TO:

INT. MINISUB - SAME TIME

They all hold on for dear life as the BLAST spins the minisub
like a toy, upends it. A blinding, blistering, white-hot
fireball races directly toward the windshield... They all
scream.

          NORMAN
     Hold on! Hold on!  Hold on!  Hold on!!!

          HARRY
     Oh, my God, we got turned around.  We're
     going into the blast.  This is the wrong
     way!!  We're piling into it!!!  Come on
     Norman, come on!!!

And the screen goes WHITE.

                              CUT TO:

INT. SHIP'S DECOMPRESSION ROOM - LATER

A bright white room.

ANGLE ON NORMAN

As he wakes up in his bunk.  Looks over.  Sees Harry snoozing
in his bunk.  Beth looks out the porthole, then turns... She
and Norman exchange a look.  She sits on the edge of his
bunk.

          NORMAN
     What's going on?

          BETH
     More of nothing.
         (beat)
     I want to thank you for saving my life.

          NORMAN
     An interesting life to save.

She squeezes his hand.  Kisses him on the cheek.

          BETH
     Get some more sleep.

He watches her as she heads back to the porthole to look out
at the ocean.  Then he rolls over, goes back to sleep.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. SHIP'S DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER - SAME TIME

TWO CREWMEN peer inside through one-way glass.

          CREWMAN #1
     Which one is Jerry?

          CREWMAN #2
     That's our problem, we really don't know.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. SHIP'S DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER - LATER

Norman, Beth and Harry sit at a card table.  A long beat --
an unspoken question hangs in the air.  Then Beth breaks the
ice.

          BETH
     So, what are we going to tell them?

          HARRY
     We can't tell them that we found an alien
     sphere on an American spacecraft from our
     own future, and we definitely can't tell
     them we discovered the power to manifest,
     just by imagining, killer jellyfish, a
     giant squid, sea snakes --

          BETH
     No.  They're definitely not ready for
     that.

          HARRY
     The greatest discovery in the history of
     mankind, and we destroyed it.  And it's
     better that we did. What if it fell into
     the wrong hands?

          NORMAN
     We were the wrong hands.  That's the
     scary part, isn't it? All three of us,
     relatively enlightened, ethical, educated.
     We think of ourselves as good people.
     But when The Sphere gave us this power,
     what did we do with it?

          BETH
     We freaked out.

          NORMAN
     Yes.  We were given the greatest gift in
     the history of mankind.
     We were given this magic ball and it
     says: "Imagine what you will and you can
     have it", and we're so primitive, we have
     so many fears that we carry with us, that
     we manifest the worst in us rather than
     the best in us....and that ain't gonna
     change.

          BETH
     Maybe we still have it.

          NORMAN
     What?

          BETH
     The power.
         (beat)
     Maybe we still have the power to manifest
     what we will.

          NORMAN
     If we do still have the power...
         (off her look)
     Then we have the power to forget. To
     manifest a world in which we don't have
     the power.

They look at each other.

          HARRY
     I say we do that. On a count of three.

They all hold hands.  Close their eyes...

          NORMAN
     One... two... three.

Then all open their eyes.

          HARRY
     Three what?

          NORMAN
     What?

          HARRY
     You said three?

          NORMAN
         (blankly)
     Three? Why are you holding my hand?

They all laugh.

                              CUT TO:

INT. SHIP - DEBRIEFING ROOM - LATER

One by one, Beth, Harry and Norman respond to questions - all
against a WHITE BACKGROUND.  They seem confused.

          NORMAN
         What do you mean?  What happened to the
         Habitat?

          HARRY
         Wait...wait...something happened to the
         Habitat?

          BETH
         The Habitat exploded?

          NORMAN
         A sphere?

          BETH
         Like a circle?

          HARRY
         Sphere?

          BETH
         Sphere?

          HARRY
         No...

          BETH
         Barnes?

          NORMAN
         Barnes?

          HARRY
         Major Barnes?

          BETH
         Edmunds and Fletcher?

          NORMAN
         I haven't seen Edmunds and Fletcher since
         we were brought back up.

          HARRY
         Something happened to them?

          BETH
         Maybe the women...Edmunds and Fletcher
         are the women.

          NORMAN
         Ted?  Where is he?

          HARRY
         I just assumed he had stayed wth Mr.
         Barnes.

          BETH
         Ted Fielding?

          NORMAN
         I would think you could tell me.

          HARRY
         He had to go out there and change the
         tapes.

          NORMAN
         The tapes are blank?  What do you mean
         the tapes are blank?

          BETH
         The tapes are blank?

          NORMAN
         Now why don't you tell us, but you're not
         telling us.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. HELIPAD - DAY

Norman runs to a waiting helicopter, his hair whipped
around by the backwash of the WHIRRING ROTORS... He
climbs into...

HELICOPTER

The PILOT we saw earlier turns to Norman.

          PILOT
     So how'd it go, Doc?

Norman looks at him, confused.

          NORMAN
         (blankly)
     What?

          PILOT
     You know, what they brought you in for.

          NORMAN
     I don't know.

          PILOT
     Oh, I get it...classified, big secret,
     huh?
         (beat)
     Hang on.  Here we go.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. SHIP - SAME TIME

Beth emerges on the bridge.  Watches as Norman's helicopter
takes off...

CLOSE ON BETH

Thinking... As if she harbors some secret... We FOLLOW
her gaze out TO the horizon and OVER the ocean... Then we
DIVE DOWN INTO the water... The debris gets thicker as we GO
DEEPER... The water gets murkier... Till it clears and we
see...

The Sphere.

FREEZE FRAME.

                                 FADE OUT.
