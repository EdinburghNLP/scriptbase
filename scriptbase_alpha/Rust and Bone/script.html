<b>                                   RUST AND BONE
</b>


                                    Written by

                        Jacques Audiard &amp; Thomas Bidegain

                  

                 Based on Craig Davidson's short story collection





                                                   16TH August 2011
                         

<b>          1. THE CHILD
</b>          Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face
          of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and
          miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids
          quickly contracting.
          Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and
          shadows, of the day's noise.

<b>          2. EXT. - NORTHWEST LANDSCAPES. DAY
</b>
          A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can
          knock a man off his feet.
          On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with
          spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25.
          He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other.
          He talks on the phone as he continues walking:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid
          with me. She can't take care of him anymore.
          I got into a fight with the guy she's with.
          I don't know where to go. What do I do with
          the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more
          credit... Call me back!
          He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Move it!
          His phone rings. He immediately answers.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do
          I get there? I don't know. Today or
          tomorrow. Yeah...
          Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny,
          he looks like a squirrel on his father's back.

<b>                         2
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3. INT. TRAIN.DAY
</b>
          There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets
          in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He
          follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where
          France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the
          bathroom, straightening his pants.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm thirsty.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          We don't have any money.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm thirsty!

<b>          4. INT. TGV. DAY
</b>
          A different speed, different countryside.
          Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a
          tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under
          other empty seats.
          Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish
          off abandoned bottles of water.

<b>          5. INT. TGV. DAY
</b>
          Another TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has
          fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the
          landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali
          opens one eye.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Stop it.
          Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their
          banging.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I said to stop it.
          The sandals freeze.
          Cut.

<b>                         3
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          6. THE CHILD
</b>          All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking
          quickly.

<b>          7. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY
</b>
          Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon
          sun.
          Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's
          hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts,
          short skirts, sandals...
          In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes.
          Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the
          other.
          Ali is on the phone:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I don't know. A big street that started at
          the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We
          just came from there!
          Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to
          the beach...

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I'm tired.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on!
          Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder.

<b>          8. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY
</b>
          A four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town.
          Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy-
          back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get
          to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a
          moustache and a cap: Richard.

<b>                         4
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          9. INT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. DAY
</b>
          While driving...

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          (Southern accent)... A couple miles back I
          saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching
          brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He
          says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred
          feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I
          ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't
          even understand what he answered. Another
          few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every
          Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go
          call your sister...
          Ali is thrown for a loop.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (uncertain) You kidding?

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          A little.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          (to Ali) Is he a little crazy?

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          (to Sam) What? You don't like my truck?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Yeah I do.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          (pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like
          my truck!

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I do too like it!
          Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears:

<b>                         SAM
</b>          (screaming) I like your truck!
          The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a
          railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's

<b>                         5
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
          distant voice.

<b>          10. EXT. SUBURBAN KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
          A kitchen with mismatched furnishings. China and cheesy
          wallpaper. Sam devours the cookies and Coke that Richard
          gives him.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          We all got fired after some Spanish guy
          bought out the trucking company... Eight
          truckers. I thought it over, discussed it
          with your sister and figured I could do it
          on my own. So I bought this truck with my
          severance pay...
          Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches. He gets up
          and opens the old fridge.

<b>                         RICHARD
</b>          Oops, poor man, not those! She'll kill you!
          Start with the expired ones, on the top
          shelf! They're organized by date. First the
          top shelf, then move down.... Anna brings it
          home from the supermarket where she works.
          As soon as they reach their expiration date,
          those idiots throw it all away, even if you
          can still eat it for a week! (to Sam) You
          want some more?

<b>          11. INT. SUBURBAN HOME. DAY
</b>
          Anna empties Sam's Spiderman bag onto the table, spilling
          out old, dirty, crumpled clothes.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          (with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all
          you have for him?
          Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a
          huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears
          leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a
          pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a
          passport and opens it. It is Sam's.

</b>          She didn't remember anything. It was already
          in there. She forgot about it, that's all.
          When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the
          kid to smuggle dope...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          That's what she told me.
          Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          How will you tend to the kid? I won't be
          able to all the time. I work, and so does
          Richard... Was he in school there?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I don't know.

<b>                         ANNA

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school?
          No answer. Sam is watching TV.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Back at your mom's place, did you go to
          school?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll
          see... We also need to get him some clothes.
          He can't go like that... I'll ask the
          neighbors.

<b>          12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING
</b>
          Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home-
          made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam
          touches them through the chicken wire.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          You want to pet them?
          She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws.
          They're just babies.
          Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next
          month. Brings in some money. Otherwise,
          Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for
          you and the kid... That okay?

</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          It's not too much, but I don't have it. I
          had to pay for the train...

          should I have gone?

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          I have no idea, but if you stay here you
          have to pay your share, or else go somewhere
          else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy:
          we can't! How long were you thinking of
          staying?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I don't know.
          She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house,
          calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel,
          giggling in delight.
          He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to
          one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special
          50 moped, plastic junk, etc.
          Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights
          shining.

<b>          13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT
</b>
          In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping
          bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the
          antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight.

<b>          14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY
</b>
          Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to
          be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can
          see Sam waiting outside in the sun.

<b>          15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY
</b>
          Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying
          to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them
          disappear into a tiny lane.
          Sam looks around a bit frightened.

          Farther off, in a busy shopping districtâ€¦
          Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security
          guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a
          wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath.

<b>                         SECURITY GUARD
</b>          Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets!
          Ali keeps his cool.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Unzip it yourself!
          Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The
          guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges:
          The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right
          hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him
          flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the
          benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own
          biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off.

<b>          16. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY
</b>
          Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the
          terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father.
          Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot
          where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A
          voice calls out.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Hey! Here I am!
          Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who
          is sniffling, tears in his eyes.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all
          alone.
          Ali unlocks the moped.

          In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a
          few 20 Euro notes.

<b>          18. EXT. ANTIBES - BEACH. DAY

          On the beach, Ali and Sam eat some McDonald's.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Are you happy here?
          Sam nods.

</b>          Mm.

</b>          The dogs.

</b>          Is that all? Nothing else besides the dogs?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          The truck.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          The dogs and the truck. The house? Auntie?
          The ocean?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          The dogs and the truck.
          Ali nods. Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the
          plastic toy from his Happy Meal.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          We have it good here...
          Ali's fingers stop. Sam looks up to find his father
          watching some girls in swimsuits go by.
          They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise.

          over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office:

          hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a
          helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie.
          He stares at Ali.

          Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down
          the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture.

          Saturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club.
          Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing
          Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van
          Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight
          boxer, guard the door.
          Ali wears a faded blue "ALTA Secu" jacket and stiff,
          matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a
          white shirt and tie. Well-groomed.
          A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued
          acts like he's hesitating:

<b>                         FOUED
</b>          Okay, I'll let you through because I'm

          vanish.

<b>                         FOUED
</b>          You say something nice, anything. That way,
          when they leave, they remember you and you
          can hit on them. If they're a little
          plastered, if things didn't go too well for
          them, you're there with a nice thing to
          say...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          And it works?

<b>                         FOUED
</b>          Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like
          that. Like a parking lot attendant...
          They are interrupted by the bouncer.

<b>                         THE CAUCASIAN
</b>          (pointing) Fight!
          They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali
          and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali
          delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off

          While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot,
          Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond,
          must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face.
          It is Stephanie.

<b>                         ALI

          Walk and breathe...
          He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her
          to walk. She looks groggy.

          We hear a voice from the parking lot.

          in pain.

          Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is
          about to scream again, but remains silent, although open-
          mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her

          thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his

          Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom.
          Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the

          There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back

          people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo,

          Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her

          It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon
          know who he was dealing with.

          metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear.
          She glances at Ali as if to say â€˜Please go now.'

          The whale washes up on the "beach" beside her. She performs

          diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles.
          A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift.
          It's about to be her turn.

          Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then
          picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat,
          then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles.
          On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the
          crowd cheers.
          What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into
          the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's
          rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing
          with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously
          tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in
          one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world
          of greens and blues whirls around them.
          Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum,
          Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the
          water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a
          rush of adrenalineâ€¦ clouds of sediment are lifted as if by
          a gust of wind.
          A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska
          immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and
          flattens him against the plastic wall.
          In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can
          make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the
          â€˜beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas
          for their next number.
          Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump
          into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into
          the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning.
          Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but
          just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears
          out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him.
          We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into
          the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge
          video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery,
          and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried
          away half the platform in her wakeâ€¦ It all seems to fall
          in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe.
          Something sinks toward usâ€¦ a body, floating weightless and
          disjointed in a cloud of red.

          Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving
          suit. She tries to find a pressure point.
          Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears:

          Sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali
          reaches in and grabs him by the arm. Sam is covered in mud,
          straw and dog shit.

          Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down. The

          and screams.

          Sam shrieks. An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee-
          shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the
          neighbors' daughter.

          Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside.
          Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open
          door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel.
          Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset
          photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on

          microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the
          window sipping coffee.
          She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled
          back. She hasn't had any sleep.
          She hears a scream. She rushes into the corridor.

          Chaos. Louise rushes into the room. She finds Stephanie

          On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's

          Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks

          always from the same POV.
          In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face
          and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another.
          Stephanie's eyes are shut.
          She opens them:
          - The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets.
          They are silent and look devastated. They occasionally
          speak to each other in whispers.

          Stephanie opens her eyes:
          - Louise is seated nearby

          She opens them.
          - A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting
          behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her
          mother. She speaks with a slight accent.

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>          I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to
          talk to you but I didn't think it was the
          right time. We'll all come with Hugo during

          It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall,
          uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy. She leans over to

          A diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed
          of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones. He examines the
          replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being
          replaced. He digs his hand into the sediment and feels
          something there. He surfaces and deposits his find on the

          hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their
          prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along.
          From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as
          if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face
          swollen by her medication and induced sleep.
          She looks through the big window that opens onto the
          exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one
          group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is
          smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of
          his hand. His name is Gilles.

          parking lot.
          Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to
          Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the
          scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth.
          There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his
          arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his

          agency.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Hey, Kadhi, come here!
          Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy.

<b>                         KADHI
</b>          Okay, okay... Are you Martial?

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         KADHI
</b>          Give me your keys.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Who's he?

<b>                         KADHI
</b>          It's fine. The boss told me he was coming.
          He works for the company.
          Ali hands him the bunch of keys.

          Ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally
          finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder.

<b>          43. INT. HYPERBRICO - STOCK ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
          Martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the
          back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by
          palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras
          still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae,
          packs of batteries... A small radio is playing a night
          program on Radio Monte Carlo.
          Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a
          hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors. He
          conceals a tiny camera inside.

          Ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Will this do?

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Perfect. Put it down there.
          Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Imagine you're the manager of a big store
          like this and the union reps have been
          busting your balls. What do you do?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Fire them.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          You think that's how it works? What do you
          do before you fire them?
          He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole,
          then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket
          monitor.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Well, beforehand you try to see how long
          they spend in the restroom, if they take
          extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the
          premises, steal from the stockroom, rip
          customers off with the sales receipts...
          When you know all that, you put the pressure
          on them and you fire the ones who don't
          leave.
          Can you give me a stroll down the aisle?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          A stroll?

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Walk down the aisle. No, further down, like
          you came out of that door there. Good,
          perfect...
          Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision.
          Martial climbs down his ladder.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Okay, then I'll be getting back.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Hold on!
          Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          It's fine.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Take it.

          Ali is in the security room reading a kickboxing magazine.
          A small radio is playing a late evening program. Outside
          in the parking lot, Kadhi smokes while walking his dog. The
          dog takes its time. Ali watches Kadhi pull on the leash.
          Ali's cell phone rings. The screen reads â€˜unknown'.

          She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick.

<b>          46. EXT. STEPHANIE'S RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
          A gated community made up of four story buildings, lawns,
          bougainvillea and lavender. It looks pretty as a picture
          and squeaky clean.

<b>          47. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAY
</b>
          The door opens automatically. He is surprised. He hears a
          tired voice from inside.

<b>                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
</b>          Come in.
          She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote
          control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali.
          Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there
          are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T-
          shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom
          whose legs hang limp.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Have you been waiting long?

          She looks exhausted but feverish.

</b>          No.

<b>                         STEPHANIE

          He sits down on a small couch.

<b>                         STEPHANIE

          wheelchair.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Need any help?
          She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her
          wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama
          legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap.

          She manages to navigate from the living room into her
          bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle
          whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours

          out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on.

          He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a
          sprinkler area. He goes to free it and gets splashed...
          Heavy chain, padlock... he comes back with soiled hands.
          When he comes back, she's gone. He sees the wheelchair

          Ali rents the whole shebang: parasol, beach towel, deck
          chair and a small tube of sunscreen 50.

          and watches him dive in, wearing his boxers, and noisily
          and clumsily crawl some laps. His body is pink and white.

          wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her
          legs. Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their

          gently.
          She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually.
          She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and
          grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread
          water. He joins her. She grabs onto him.

</b>          This is bothering me!
          She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts
          press against Ali's chest.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay, you can let go.
          She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put,
          holding her t-shirt.
          Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a
          burst of laughter.
          Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time
          to see how she's doing.
          She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She
          motions for him to come and get her.
          He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on
          to him, still out of breath.

          She shuts her eyes.

</b>          Fuck that's good!
          The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck
          chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away.
          They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her
          lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe.

          heavenward.

          A decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean
          workout room. Guys of every color work the punching bags,
          lift weights, do chin-ups... From the gym next door, we
          hear the booming music of an aerobics class.
          In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down
          with protective gear, pound each other. Each of their blows
          lands right on target. They repeat the same series of moves
          several times at varying speeds.

          Ali and Foued are dripping wet. They have towels around
          their necks. They fill their small plastic bottles at a
          faucet in the workout room.
          Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the
          aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in
          rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the
          braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure,
          as she swings it from one shoulder to the other.

          Outside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had
          prepared for him. A bit farther off, the aerobics
          instructor is smoking in the sun. She has a short, buff
          body. She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them
          out sparingly.

          A cell phone vibrates. Through a narrow transom, a ray of
          sun slices through the dark equipment room. They haven't
          bothered undressing. Ali and the aerobics instructor are
          making love on a pile of workout mats.
          Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent,
          vibrates again. He answers. We hear a crackling voice.

          Sam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the
          schoolyard.
          Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a
          corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard. The principal
          is waiting for him at the door. Ali spurts out some quick
          apologies.
          Sam slowly slides off the structure. We hear the noise of
          his hands skidding on metal.

          Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach. Ali is
          so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike. Behind him on
          the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him. Sam's
          hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco-BN
          cookies. Ali takes one too.
          To their left, a train noisily speeds by.

          Stephanie hangs onto Louise's neck. Louise lifts her out of

</b>          No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to
          grab his legs. Wait.
          His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's
          Martial. He answers.

<b>                         ALI

          He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets
          up to go speak.

          Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden.
          Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then
          goes running.
          Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone
          conversation.

          from? He gave me a website if you want to

          From the living room, Ali hears Sam screaming in the
          garden.

</b>          Tell him to give the website to his mother.

          Ali goes to the window.
          Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a
          jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal
          cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her
          arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark.
          Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into
          the house.

          Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having

          Sam refuses to calm down. Anna looks at her brother.

          He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table.
          Silence.
          Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying.
          He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his
          scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his
          head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over,
          upset.

<b>          66. EXT. BEACH. DAY

          The day is over. The beach boy has already packed away most
          of his paraphernalia. In the water, Ali and Stephanie are
          out with some of the last swimmers.
          Faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit, he
          carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs. They come out
          of the water in the middle of a discussion.

          end wins. Hey, you're strangling me!
          He puts her down on her chair.

          A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with
          the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust.
          Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the
          overhead strap to avoid hurting herself.
          At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge
          homies. They signal Martial to over.
          He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside.
          They see Ali and Stephanie in the back.

</b>          His girlfriend.
          Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his
          reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial
          drives in.

<b>          68. EXT / INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY

          Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted
          windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked
          around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding
          every balcony. Some men are over in one corner,
          discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking
          guys.
          In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans,
          is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up,

          the passenger seat.

          The blazing sun is melting the asphalt. A coin bounces
          between pairs of basketball shoes.
          The cousin picks it up. He points to Ali and the guy in the
          black shorts.

          Martial takes the T shirt and leans over to Ali.

          Ali doesn't flinch. The cousin, the bettors and the other
          fighters move away.

          Stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies
          overhead. She hears the spectators' hostility and cheers.
          A circle has formed around the fighters.
          She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's
          fist barely miss Ali's face.
          Then things speed up. Ali uses his feet, knees and fists.
          When his opponent begins to totter to one side, Ali hangs
          onto him like a pit bull. When he falls, Ali pounds on his
          face with his fists and elbows. The â€˜ref' has to enlist
          Cousin's help to pull Ali away.
          Ali returns to his place in the car. Stephanie looks at
          him: he can't sit still.

<b>                         ALI

          She sees the banknotes in people's hands.
          She sees heads leaning over balconies.
          She sees an opponent's fist hit Ali behind the ear.
          She sees another of Ali's opponents get back to his feet,
          and Ali's fist split open his nose like a ripe fig.
          She sees another opponent's head bounce off the concrete.
          She sees a tooth roll across the concrete, like dice in a
          crap game.
          She sees Ali perform three steps of a moonwalk and kiss his
          own biceps.

          CU on a long cut behind Ali's ear. Stephanie's fingers use
          a Kleenex instead of cotton.
          Bare-chested with a towel around his neck, Ali leans
          forward to make his wound more easily accessible.

          Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and
          remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his
          throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes
          the welts on his body.
          A big service station appears a bit farther down the road.
          Ali sits back up.

          Behind the wheel of his stopped car, Martial counts the
          bills spread out on his lap.

          Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service
          station.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          No, since you know him, I just wanted to

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          No.
          Martial finishes counting the bills.

</b>          He freaks me out.
          He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope.

</b>          1200 for him.
          She looks at the envelope without taking it.

</b>          Why are you giving me that?

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          It's for Ali.

<b>                         STEPHANIE

</b>          Hey, you make it complicated. Either you
          take it or you don't. And either I talk or I
          keep my mouth shut.
          He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally
          gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green
          John Deere tractor with all the accessories.

          The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on
          his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the
          coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes.
          He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the
          beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic.

</b>          You see what you're like with him? You're
          not around and when you are, you scream at
          him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him
          along if you act like that? You should have
          left him.

          on purpose. I'm sorry about it.
          Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls
          out the envelope of money and hands it to her.

          only job you could find?
          Is that why you have marks on your face?

          He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest
          of the group.
          They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam
          and his little friends are playing in the sand with the
          John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali
          sits down in the sand next to him.

          Sam continues to play, ignoring him. Behind them, Richard
          is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded
          neighbor who is also there with all his family.

          A nearby house. Evening is falling. Ali and JoÃ«lle make
          love in her bedroom. His cell phone rings. The screen
          reads: "Stef". He doesn't answer. JoÃ«lle comes noisily. Ali
          puts his hand over her mouth.
          Through the window, we see Sam in Anna's garden, playing

          Sitting on the couch in a T-shirt and boxers, Stephanie
          finishes her dinner, watching TV distractedly.
          Balancing on her stumps, she puts her plate in the
          dishwasher. Then, supporting herself on her hands, she
          leaves the kitchen, wiggling her way into the bedroom. She
          lifts herself into bed as best she can.
          Evening falls over the bougainvilleas. Stephanie watches
          old people coming home in their wheelchairs or hanging on

          Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the

          She shakes her head "no" and points to a box of biscuits on
          the shelf.

</b>          You don't have anyone?

</b>          Yes, but they're not girlfriends.

          I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it

          that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't
          know... they bored me.
          Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't
          understand, or didn't believe her.

</b>          How do you think I go about it? If I were a

          Ali is dumbstruck.

</b>          Okay, let's change the subject...
          She begins piling up plates and silverware.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You want to fuck?
          She is thrown for a loop.

</b>          Huh?

          He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous
          laugh.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Just like that?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Um, yeah. Give me that.
          He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the
          dishwasher.

          She hesitates.

</b>          Wait.
          She wheels herself away from the table and into the
          bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table.

</b>          Okay? Ready?
          Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Let's try.
          He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her,
          but she pushes him away gently.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't
          kiss?

</b>          No. Your breasts... can I?

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Yes.
          He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering
          her. She tries to wriggle herself free.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          You're crushing me!

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Okay, I'll stop.
          His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her
          thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets
          herself go.
          She grabs hold of him.

          Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie
          appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell
          she feels too shy to look at him.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Are you okay? How was it?
          She blushes.

          Ali doesn't understand.

</b>          But did you enjoy it or not?

          A beat.

          She sketches a vague gesture.

          Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.

</b>          Nothing. Great.

          Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to
          the staff room. The room is apparently empty.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Louise? Louise, are you here? Is anyone
          here?
          No answer.
          She looks over the office she once knew so well and that
          hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the
          wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names,
          etc...

<b>          88. EXT. MARINELAND - BLEACHERS. DAY
</b>
          Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools,
          the big one as well as the others... suddenly, in nÂ° 3, a
          huge but limp black dorsal fin appears.

<b>          89. EXT. POOL N3. DAY
</b>
          Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down
          on the rim of pool nÂ° 3 to reach the water. She reaches out
          and slaps the water with the palm of her hand. Nothing

          really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the
          bottom of the pool... She slaps again and the black mass
          swims faster and faster... a wave is formed around the
          sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher...
          Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska
          emerges.

          Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex-
          colleagues. They have been there a moment, surprised,
          unsettled and ill at ease.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          I stopped by the office but there wasn't
          anyone.
          Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes. The guys
          rush over to help her. They hug and kiss. All four remain
          like that for a moment.

          Sun and music. The public is beginning to invade the lanes
          and paths.
          Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace
          of the employees' cafeteria. They are thrilled and
          reassured to see her again. At times a hand touches her
          arm or shoulder. Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and
          kisses her.
          Under the table, Stephanie types â€˜oper?' into her cell
          phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings.
          We can imagine the "How are you?" "And you?" "Great". The
          "Let me get a look at you... You look wonderful!"...all a

          her, leans over to her:

</b>          (softly) See? It wasn't hard!
          They smile at each other and return to the conversation in
          progress. Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table. She
          discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up,
          exchanges a glance with Louise.
          From that glance, we cut to:

          Stephanie and Louise are out shopping. Stephanie holds
          herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing. We
          join their conversation already in progress.

</b>          I'm with a friend.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          You bring girls back to my place now?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          She's a friend, I said.
          Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on
          her crutches. Anna is dismayed. Ali motions to Stephanie:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my
          sister! (to Anna) This is Stephanie. You
          know the girl from Marineland.
          Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then
          realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth:

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          Oh, my God. Poor thing!

<b>                         82

          Sam arrives with his snack. Stephanie looks at him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          So that's him?
          They are sitting around the garden table. Anna comes
          carrying a tray.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          They were out of grapefruit. I took tropical
          fruit.
          She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on
          the table. Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can
          watch Sam playing under the table.

<b>                         ANNA
</b>          I'll make tea. I have some cookies. You
          drink tea, don't you?

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Don't bother. This is perfect, I swear.
          Thanks.
          Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the
          way back to the kitchen.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You don't want to get going?

<b>                         STEPH
</b>          Wait, your sister...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You freak her out. Can't you see? She feels
          like a cashier with you. Pathetic with her
          tea and cookies. It's a pain.
          Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                         STEPH
</b>          I'm going to help her.

          Later, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the
          house. She has a hard time with her â€˜legs' and canes.

<b>          98. INT. SAM'S ROOM. DAY
</b>
          A child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins.
          Stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          So this is where you sleep? It's a nice
          room.
          Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Why are you looking at me like that? Does it
          scare you? You want to see them, is that it?
          He nods.
          She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis
          underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand,
          touches it carefully.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Does it hurt?
          Stephanie smiles at him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          No... Want to touch it?
          Sam reaches out his hand.

<b>          99. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY
</b>
          In CU through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes
          Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and
          being pummeled.
          Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel
          around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees.

<b>                         84

          Ali watches the fight. Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills
          a plastic bag with ice cubes. She hands it to him.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Here.
          He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand
          of hair and replaces it with another.
          We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          You okay?
          He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          You ready?
          Ali nods â€˜yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and
          empties the bottle of water over his head.
          Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the
          spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the
          air conditioning full blast.

          His opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe.
          Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare. And
          then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a
          kick behind the ear.
          He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying. He
          is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can. He
          tries to block his opponent's arm. He hears himself
          wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows. He sees his
          blood splatter his opponent.

<b>                         ALI (OFF)
</b>          ... All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's
          like it tasted like bone. A taste of rust
          and bone.

<b>                         STEPHANIE (OFF)
</b>          Because you think bone has a taste?

<b>                         ALI (OFF)
</b>          Yeah, there I did.
          Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something:
          sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just
          opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a
          pair of shortsâ€¦ He also sees the heads of the tough guys
          who turn back to look.
          He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of
          blood and returns to the task at hand.
          His opponent tries to get up. Ali jumps on him to finish

<b>                         HIM OFFÂ€¦
</b>
<b>          101. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY
</b>
          The car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The
          windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek
          bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over
          his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what
          they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the
          open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial
          does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suitâ€¦

<b>          102. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES. DAY
</b>
          Muzak.
          Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store.
          Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent,
          hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's
          happening.
          The head of security elbows his way through.

<b>          HEAD OF SECURITY
</b>          Let them through, please!
          The personnel reluctantly make way.

          Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the
          ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager,
          protected by two guards and being harangued by union
          representatives.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          (to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the
          equipment. I need to see him.
          Ali obeys.

<b>                         UNION REP
</b>          Don't bother. We're the ones who will call
          the police. The police and the press. That
          way they'll know you spy on your workers!
          The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards.

<b>                         UNION REP
</b>          At least have the courage to look at me when
          I talk to you!

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>          The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have
          been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime
          squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends
          over to retrieve the equipment.

<b>                         WOMAN (OFF)
</b>          What are you doing there?
          She's a young employee in the store uniform.

</b>          (suspicious) Packing up.

</b>          Is it your stuff?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          No.
          He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a
          picture.

<b>                         87

          She continues to manipulate her phone.

<b>                         WOMAN

          He straightens up menacingly.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I'm going to slap you!
          A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Forget it. Let's get out of here!

<b>                         ALI

          Martial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest.
          He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He
          smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags
          are packed, all he has to do is close them.
          He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on
          his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front
          of room 429.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I

          fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that
          while I'm not here...
          She is thunderstruck.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Is he okay with that?

<b>                         MARTIAL

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Why me?

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          I guess he trusts you.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          (laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure
          but.... I don't know anything about that

          He hands her an old spiral notebook.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          I wrote it all down here. As for the rest,
          ask me your questions and I'll answer them.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          How do I do the bets?

<b>                         MARTIAL

<b>                         STEPHANIE

          A beat.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          And you need money to cover the bets, and
          you have money.
          She looks at him.

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          What? You're not rich? What did the
          insurance company give you for your legs?
          200,000? 300,000? Those jobs must have good
          health plans. Am I wrong?

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          No.
          A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open
          bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place
          looks like it's expecting a police raid.

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Where are you going?

<b>                         MARTIAL

<b>                         MARTIAL
</b>          Yes.
          A beat. He gives her time to wrap her head around that one.
          Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the
          hand.

          Through the door of the club, we hear snatches of the
          introduction to Thunderstruck.
          People are sweating and trying to get into the Fever. Foued
          lets Martial, Ali, Stephanie and Khadi through. Virile bear
          hugs and handshakes.

          Ali knows and greets everyone. Stephanie is in the middle
          of the group. She holds herself up on the shoulders of
          these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along.
          She feels good

          The club is hot as a steam bath. Loud music blares out of
          loudspeakers. Bodies dance and eyes shine bright.
          At the table "left of the bar": Cousin and three friends
          who are with him. Another round of bear hugs and
          handshakes. Martial, Stephanie and Cousin regroup face to
          face. Martial speaks, Cousin listens and at times looks
          over at Stephanie, who looks at him too. She notices one of
          the tattoos on his arm: a green and red snake that seems to
          be slithering out his sleeve. The barman brings two bottles
          of champagne.
          Ali leans toward her:

          The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off,
          the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise
          from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie
          watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to
          her. She accepts and takes a drag.

          We are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther
          off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through
          the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance
          floor, Ali is no longer there.
          Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks
          for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions
          that he's leaving. She waves: "Yeah, ok, I get it."
          Ali disappears with the girl.
          Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into

          to her. She also failed to notice that he's been speaking
          to her for a while now.

          The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He
          might be thought to resemble Simon.

</b>          What's your name? I'm Pierre.

          Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the
          room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She
          can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts
          under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns
          his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on
          the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away
          immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time
          to put a good face on it.

</b>          No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not

          The guy looks disappointed, then manages a â€˜good loser's'
          smile.

          away.

          Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something
          is wrong.
          When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a
          bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of
          her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to
          help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on
          his skull.
          Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.

          milky light of a day that looks like it's going to be
          sunless.
          Stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the
          terrace. Behind her, chairs are still piled up and the
          waiter is slowly getting to work.
          A silhouette appears on the sidewalk. It's Ali, in the same
          clothes as last night. He joins her and takes a seat.

          flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on.
          He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin,
          bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck

          Through the tinted windshield of a Nissan Pathfinder SUV,
          Ali watches Stephanie, wearing a tight T shirt and leaning
          on her cane, talking with Cousin and some bettors. The
          discussion looks intense.
          Stephanie returns to the car. Below her pedal pushers, her
          prostheses sparkle in the sunlight. We hear salacious jibes
          from the surrounding buildings.
          She opens the car door.

<b>                         ALI

          Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect
          she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door.
          The remarks cease.

          CU: a black and red arrow with, in industrial characters:

<b>          "RIGHT".
</b>          It's the tattoo on Stephanie's right thigh. Ali's hand
          grips and squeezes the thigh. They are making love.
          The room is half-lit. Ali growls and grinds his teeth in
          his sleep. Stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to
          her side of the bed. She gets up and, using her hands,
          drags herself toward the bathroom.
          Suddenly, feeling like he's suffocating, Ali awakens. It
          takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is. His
          hand sweeps across the bed.

<b>                         ALI

          Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes
          and leans over her...

          Stephanie is sitting on the toilet, while Ali pees in the

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          I called the numbers they gave me at the

<b>                         STEPHANIE
</b>          Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to
          organize a test match, to see what you're
          worth. To see if you've got the "GÃ¶ttlicher

          Ali comes out of the shower.

</b>
          He carries her back into the bedroom. She looks at his
          face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose.

</b>          How's your nose?

</b>          No.
          They look at each other.
          He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her.
          Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places
          her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving.
          She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock.
          She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away,
          surprised.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Now we're allowed?
          No answer.
          They make love.

          The road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of
          Italian cities. The landscape has changed.
          Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives
          with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the
          voice of an Italian DJ.

          Ali jogs along the sea shore. He sweats, huffing and
          puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but
          soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him
          down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into
          the near distance.
          Nothing.

          A standard hotel lobby.
          Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day
          before the â€˜Ultimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants
          squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows,
          collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears...
          Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some

          Bleachers have been set up in a gym, surrounding a cage-

          On the floor, two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other.
          One is bleeding from the forehead.
          Below the ring, Stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of

          A sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from
          the top of the stairs.

          An SMS arrives from Stephanie: â€œAlmost there. I miss you.â€�
          Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He
          hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and
          begins to stuff things into a bag.
          A new message arrives: â€œI'm home. Oper?â€� Ali hesitates,
          then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed.

          Night has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom
          window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in
          the garden downstairs with her face in her hands.
          A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees
          his father stomp down the street, never once looking back.
          Sam remains glued to the window pane.
          Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight
          before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him
          for as far as he can.

          In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has
          formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie
          looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building
          equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a
          trestle...
          Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit
          farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them.

          leave.

</b>          He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck

          A frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been
          engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track
          suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some
          shadowbox while running.
          Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He
          runs alongside Foued.

          A ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys
          have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his
          trainer's bear-like paws.
          Leonardini sets the pace.

          Young athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some
          not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch TV. Ali does
          too. His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven.

          Through the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a
          stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn.
          Ali runs out to meet it.

          A path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees.
          Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is
          a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him.
          Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of
          squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen
          any before. Ali neither.
          Sunlight filters through the branches. A group of cross-
          country skiers trudges by.

<b>                         SAM

</b>          Skiing.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          You're annoying me.
          They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some
          sandwiches and drink orange soda.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (his mouth full) Does Auntie still have
          dogs?

</b>          No, now it's chickens.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          But Auntie doesn't want me to take the
          chicks in my room.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing
          to his sandwich) Finished? You want some

          Afternoon.
          On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully
          advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he
          lets himself go and glides across the ice.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You can go. But not too far!
          Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on
          the sled and lets it glide.
          Ali pees behind a tree.
          Sam is far away.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Come on, we have to head back!

<b>                         SAM
</b>          5 minutes.

</b>          (showing his fingers) 5 minutes!

<b>                         ALI
</b>          5 minutes.
          And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He
          tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is
          forming over him.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Daddy! Daddy!

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Shit!
          Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He
          kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole.
          Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks
          everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise,
          blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls

<b>                         117

          over and clears away snow as best he can. Under the ice, he
          sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed.
          Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons
          or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag.

<b>          139. UNDER THE ICE. DAY
</b>          Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds. Sam sees his
          father's fists pound on the ice. He sees bloodstains.
          The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him.
          Sam closes his eyes.

<b>          140. EXT. POND. EVENING

          Evening is falling. Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of
          the pond. The child has turned blue. He tries mouth-to-
          mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him
          down.

<b>          141. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. EVENING

          Ali's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan.
          He runs. He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka
          and runs as fast as he can. He slips, gets back up and runs
          again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still
          running...

          Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali
          sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors...
          his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his
          mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a
          respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water
          brutally...
          A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up.

<b>                         NURSE
</b>          We'll take care of you. Come with me.
          He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his
          hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred
          fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.

          Sam is lying in a hospital bed. His eyes are closed and
          coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus.
          Ali is at his side. His hands are now wrapped in thick
          bandages. The disinfectant makes him look like he is
          wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms.
          Richard is standing behind him, near the window.
          Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his
          bandaged hand and looks at them.
          Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids... his
          fingers quiver... his eyes open.

          There are not many people in the corridor at this late
          hour. Richard is bent over a coffee machine. A cup slowly
          fills up. Farther off, Ali is KO, leaning against a wall.
          Richard brings him a coffee. Ali takes it clumsily into his
          damaged hands.
          Richard's cell phone rings. He moves away to answer and
          speaks into it softly. A few moments later, he returns to
          Ali and hands him the phone.

</b>          I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going.
          I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing.

<b>          145. INT. POLAND. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
</b>
          A child sleeps.
          His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light
          and shadow, of noise.
          Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room. At the foot of
          the bed, a TV with the sound turned down low is
          broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish.
          Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the
          floor and packing their bags.
          Over these images, we hear Ali's voice:
          The human hand contains 27 bones. Some
          monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in

<b>                         121
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         
          each thumb. For humans, it's 27.
          If you break an arm or a leg, after a while
          calcium gathers around the bone and joins it
          together. In the end, it's stronger than
          before. But if you break a bone in your
          hand, you know it'll never fully heal.
          You'll think about it before every fight.
          You'll pay attention... And even if you pay
          attention, the pain will come back... like
          needles, like broken glass...
          Ali is wearing a T-shirt. He still bears the marks of
          yesterday's fight. His eyebrows and hands are bandaged.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Did you win?
          He smiles and kisses his biceps.

<b>          146. INT. POLAND. HOTEL - LOBBY. DAY
</b>
          The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate
          tournament... (much the same ambience as in Turin) The
          fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave. They
          greet each other, pose for photographers, answer
          interviewers, sign autographs... Ali's hands are still
          bandaged. He is being interviewed along with a kind of
          Viking with a closed eye and broken arm.
          Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where
          a taxi driver is loading their luggage. A young Polish fan
          calls out: "Ali! Ali!" He wants a photo.
          Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer.
          They pose.
