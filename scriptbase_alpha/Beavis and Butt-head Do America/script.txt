          The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
     and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
     what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
     debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
     coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
     like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
     footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
     intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
     SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
     up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
     shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
     huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
     Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
     buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
          Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
     He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
     swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
     stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
     reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
     lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
     his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
     screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
     lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
     huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
     "Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
     We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
     giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
     around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
     BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
     destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
     Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
     puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
     the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
          We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
     Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
     him.
     
     
     INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
     
     
                         BEAVIS (O.C.)
               Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
     
     Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
     
     Butt-Head comes around.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
               Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               What's gone?
     
                         BEAVIS
               The TV.
     
     Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
     
     Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
     was.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
     
     Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their 
     van.
     
     Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
     see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
     
     Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
     DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
     a couple of times - piecing it all together.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               Whoa! I think I just figured something
               out Beavis.
     
                         BEAVIS
               What?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This sucks.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh.
     
     Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
     the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
     
     Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
     the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This sucks more than anything that
               has ever sucked before. We must find
               this butt-hole that took the TV.
     
     
     EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
     
     Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
     
     A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
     fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
     chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
     off his glasses.
     
     FREEZE ON BEAVIS
     
                         ANNOUNCER
               Beavis!
     
     FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Freeze, butt-wipe!
     
     An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
     a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
     
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
     waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
     collar way open. He plops down in the bed.
     
     FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
     
                         ANNOUNCER
               Butt-Head!
     
     FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
     
                         ANNOUNCER
               Star in...
     
     
     MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
     
     
     EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
     
     ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
     
     OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
     would.
     
     Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
     
     Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
     
     Beavis drives, chasing a car.
     
     Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
     Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
     
     A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.
     
     B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
     
     In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
     
     Butt-Head does the same.
     
     Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
     
     A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
     FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
     bed. Suddenly...
     
     
     INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
     
     From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
     
     B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
     attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
     the cart we hear more equipment falling.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Dammit, it's stuck.
     
     They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
     the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
     all come crashing to the ground.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
               thing back to the house.
     
     
     INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
     
     MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
               here?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, someone stole our TV.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
               Get outta the way. Heh heh.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
               Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
               experience for you guys. There's a
               wonderful world out there when we discover
               we don't need TV to entertain us.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (to himself)
               Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
               heh. Anus. Heh heh.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
                         (frustrated)
               Have you guys heard a word I've said?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
               A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
               more open-minded. Mmkay?
     
     Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               What a dork. Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
     
     
     EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
     
     B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
     attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
     and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
                         BEAVIS
               No it wasn't!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh,...Oh yeah.
     
     B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
     PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
     
                         McVICKER
               Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
               get out! You're suspended. One more
               screw up... and you're expelled.
     
     B&B walk off laughing.
     
     
     EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
     
     B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
               know Anderson had a Camper.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
               Heh heh. TV.
     
     B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
     ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
     
                         MARCY
               Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
               at the refrigerator?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, no.
     
                         BEAVIS
               We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
     
                         MARCY
               Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
               Come on in.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cool. Huh huh huh.
     
     B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
     
     
     EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
     
     Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
     
                         TOM
               Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
               the most important thing you can have
               on a camper is a good propane regulator,
               and this here's the best one they make.
     
                         MARCY
               I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
               before we leave.
     
                         TOM
               Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
               our whole lives and we're gonna go come
               Hell or high water...
     
     Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B 
     AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
     
                         TOM (CONT.)
               What the hell is that noise?
     
     
     INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
     
     B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
     refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
     counter on which the TV is sitting.
     
     Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
     OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
     
                         BEAVIS
               AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
     
     ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
     TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
     goes dead.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
     
     
     EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
     
     B&B come out. Tom notices them.          
     
                         TOM
               Hey, what's goin' on here?
     
                         MARCY
               They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
     
                         TOM
               The TV ain't broken.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
     
     Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.
     
     TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
     
                         TOM
               Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
               familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
               been whackin' off in my tool shed?
     
                         BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
     and forth.
     
     B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
     
     
     EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
     
     B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
     the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
     Cowboy."
     
                         BEAVIS
               Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               What's your problem Beavis?
     
                         BEAVIS
               I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
     
     Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
     golden, throbbing light.
     
     BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
     Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
     featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
     Rates."
     
     B&B stare up, as if at a god.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (crazed)
               Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
     
     
     EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
     
     Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
     door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
     
     B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
     legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
     him.
     
                         McVICKER
               Please mmm... may I have another?!
     
     B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
     
                         McVICKER (CONT.)
               Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
               bastards.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Can we watch your TV?
     
                         McVICKER
               Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
     
     Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
     the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
     by McVicker asking for another.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
               everything!
     
     
     INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
     
     The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
     talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
     - a Jack Ruby type.
     
     On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
     bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
     
                         MUDDY
               ...Are you sure these guys can pull this
               off? It's gotta look like an accident...
     
     We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
     
                         MUDDY (CONT.)
               Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
               I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
               Come in!
     
     B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (sounding suddenly sedated)
               Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
     
                         MUDDY
               Yer late.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
     
     MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.
     
                         MUDDY
               Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
               jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
               the job done. So what are your names?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, Butt-Head.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Beavis.
     
                         MUDDY
               That's alright. I'd rather not know your
               real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
               gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
               ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
               you do her...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (full of innuendo)
               Do her? Huh huh.
     
                         MUDDY
               That's right. I'm offering you ten grand
               plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
     
     Butt-Head stares in shock.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your
               wife.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (trembling)
               Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
     
     Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
               to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay
               us. We can buy a new TV.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (to Muddy)
               Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
     
                         MUDDY
               Okay, then let's get down to business.
     
     ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
     Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
     
                         MUDDY (CONT.)
               Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
               as sweet as she looks. She stole everything
               from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll
               do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
     
     Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
     
                         MUDDY
               She's holed up in a hotel room in Las
               Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of
               hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the
               airport.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Can we watch some TV first?
     
     Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
     
                         MUDDY
               No.
     
     
     EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING
     
     Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with 
     bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the 
     rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a 
     SHRIEK.
     
                         MUDDY
               One more thing. Mah wife's got this
               leather satchel. It's black, about this
               big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
               real important. Sentimental value... Any
               questions so far?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
     
                         MUDDY
               She sure does.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
     
                         MUDDY
               Just make sure it looks like an 
               accident...
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (spastic)
               Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
               accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
     
                         MUDDY
               Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
               a drink on it.
     
     Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
     
     
     EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
     
     In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
     fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
     away.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               We're gonna get paid to score.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
               get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Beavis, this is the greatest day of
               our lives. Huh huh huh.
     
     
     INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
     
     B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
     right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
     them.
     
                         DOLORIS
               Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
     
                         DOLORIS
               I think your tickets have you seated
               in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
               you just go ahead and move back, OK?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               That's OK. Someone else can have those.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, it's not that important to me,
               really. Those seats are too small anyways.
     
     Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
     aisle.
     
     ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
     woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
     
                         DOLORIS
               Here you are.
     
     She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
     Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
               here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
               huh huh.
     
     Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
     
                         MARTHA
               Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
               Vegas?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, we're gonna score.
     
                         MARTHA
               I hope to score big there myself. I'm
               mostly going to be doing the slots.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. 
               Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in
               Las Vegas?
     
                         MARTHA
               Oh, there are so many slots you won't
               know where to begin.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick
               is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be
               tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cool. Huh huh huh.
     
                         MARTHA
               It's so nice to meet young men who are so
               well mannered.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a
               big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
     
                         MARTHA
               Oh, that's nice.
     
                         CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         (through P.A.)
               Good morning. This is your captain
               speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151
               non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you
               turn your attention to the front of the
               cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
     
     B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
     
                         ATTENDANT'S VOICE
               To fasten your seat belt, insert the free
               end into the coupling.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Insert. Huh huh huh.
     
     Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               Uh...
     
     They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's 
     parts.
     
                         TAMMY (O.C.)
               Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
     
     Butt-Head looks up.
     
     From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her 
     hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
     
     CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull 
     one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
     
     Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud 
     CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
     
                         TAMMY (CONT.)
               There you go. You're all set.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (stunned)
               I love you.
     
     Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Wait, I wanted her to do it.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
     
                         CAPTAIN'S VOICE
               Flight attendants, please prepare for
               take-off.
     
     The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
     
     Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything 
     but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
     
     The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to 
     freak.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
     
     Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window 
     and realizes they're in the air.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
                         (screams)
               Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
     
     ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:
     
                         MAN
               D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
     
                         WOMAN
               Oh my God!!!!!!!
     
     ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting 
     up.
     
     ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all
               gonna die!
     
     The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the 
     plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down 
     the aisle.
     
     ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
     
     In free fall:
     
     Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes 
     tearing out.
     
     Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which 
     open and spill their contents.
     
     Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and 
     coffee to pour freely.
     
     ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their 
     screaming.
     
     ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's 
     directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is 
     strapped in.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
               thing with my belt again?
     
     
     INT.  PLANE - LATER
     
     All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the 
     aisle. People read, relaxed.
     
     ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her 
     grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy 
     gave him.
     
                         BEAVIS
               I'm probably going to make out with her
               first before we, you know, get down...
     
                         MARTHA
               You'll have to speak up son. I have this
               ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
               could be related to my heart
               palpitations. I've had two operations on
               my heart.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Really? I poop too much.
     
                         MARTHA
               Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
               I get tired.
     
                         MARTHA
               Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
               take a couple of these.
     
     She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
     
                         MARTHA (CONT.)
               They perk me right up.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh, thanks.
     
     He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. 
     Then his eyes open wide.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
                         (strange)
               Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
     
     Beavis starts wolfing them down.
     
     
     INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER
     
     Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with 
     Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (to Tammy)
               So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
               Vegas? Huh huh huh.
     
     Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
     
     ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
     
     PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The 
     guy's asleep.
     
     Butt-head picks up the beer.
     
     ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. 
     Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, 
     etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
     
     Tammy reaches her next passenger.
     
                         TAMMY
               Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
               tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
               gumbo...
     
                         BEAVIS (O.S.)
               Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
     
     Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the 
     background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of 
     Cornholio mode.
     
                         PASSENGER
               Does the gumbo have corn in it?
     
     ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his 
     head in full Cornholio mode.
     
                         BEAVIS
               I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
               my bunghole!
     
                         TAMMY
               You'll have to wait your turn sir.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Are you threatening me? My bunghole
               will not wait!
     
     Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
     
     ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the 
     other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being 
     pressed.
     
     ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
     
     ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
     
     The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit 
     slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
     
     The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee 
     to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain 
     then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A 
     NOSE-DIVE.
     
     ON BUTT-HEAD
     
     In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take 
     a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go 
     FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
     
     Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in 
     the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, 
     and he continues to fly forward.
     
     COCKPIT
     
     The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
     
     Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel 
     facing the captain.
     
                         CAPTAIN
               Get the hell out of the cockpit!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh, you said...
     
                         CAPTAIN
               NOW!!!
     
     The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane 
     out of the dive.
     
     
     EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
     
     The plane lands.
     
     
     INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
     
     The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people 
     deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with 
     flecks of spilled food and other matter.
     
                         ATTENDANTS
               Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
     
     They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T-
     shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
     
     INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
     
     Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two 
     businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their 
     names. A reunited couple hugs.
     
     B&B look around in confusion.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be
               casinos and lights and stuff.
     
     People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
     
     One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a 
     sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
     
     B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
               a sign?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
               this out.
     
     B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and 
     hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         DRIVER
               Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where
               I can find these guys, would ya?
     
     He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his 
     pants. They look and try to read:
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (reads)
               Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (reads)
               Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (realizes)
               Huh huh. This says Beavis.
     
                         BEAVIS
               And Boot-Head.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,
               Beavis. These dudes have the same name as
               us.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, we should party.
     
     The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
     
                         DRIVER
               This way, sirs.
     
     B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
     
                         BEAVIS
               So where's those guys?
     
     
     EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's 
     TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the 
     door.
     
                         ROSS
               Where the hell is he?
     
                         HARLAN
               You sure this is the right place?
     
     Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No 
     one's there.
     
     Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next 
     to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
     
                         HARLAN (CONT.)
               You Muddy?
     
                         MUDDY
                         (slurring)
               You the cops?
     
                         ROSS
               Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
               care of your wife...
     
     Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
     
                         MUDDY
               What the hell?!... What about those other...
     
                         ROSS
               Huh?
     
     Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
     four.
     
                         MUDDY
               Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
     
                         HARLAN
               Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
               wanna buy a new one?
     
     Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
     
                         MUDDY
               I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all
               three a' them!
     
     Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
     
     Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF 
     THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the 
     back onto the sidewalk.
     
     Ross starts to pick it up.
     
                         HARLAN
               Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
     
                         ROSS
               Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'
               from rich people.
     
     
     EXT.  LAS VEGAS - DAY
     
     MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
     
          Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot 
          Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las 
          Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do 
          With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like 
          "Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's 
          "You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.
     
     The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling 
     up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
     
     Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever.
     
     ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They 
     should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song.
     
     PAN DOWN rows of slot machines.
     
     PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips.
     
     DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe.
     
     REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a 
     bare-chested woman.
     
     Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Beavis. This is what it's all about.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (speechless)
               Heh heh. Yeah.
     
     
     EXT.  VEGAS - DUSK
     
     Lights are popping on.
     
     Billboards and signs are lighting up.
     
     The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK
     
     ON B&B, still staring at the statue.
     
                         B&B
                         (in awe)
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     A security guard comes and drags B&B away.
     
     ON THE LOUNGE BAND, continuing the song we've been hearing.
     
     
     INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The door is opened by a bellboy.
     
                         BELLBOY
               I'm so sorry about that little
               misunderstanding. We didn't know you
               were registered guests. Here's some
               playing chips compliments of...
     
     Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the 
     night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.
     
                         BEAVIS
               This remote's too heavy!
     
                         BELLBOY
               Sir, it's attached to the...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Here, dumbass! Let me try!
     
     They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over 
     backwards.
     
     Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.
     
     
     INT.  ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT
     
     The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated 
     people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:
     
                         ELEVATOR VOICE
               Ninth floor, going down.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Going down. Huh huh huh.
     
     The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
     
     MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk 
     among the gambling tables.
     
     Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites 
     into it.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Ow! These chips suck.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find
               that chick.
     
     Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table.
     
     ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13.
     
     At the table, the DEALER...
     
                         DEALER
               13. We have a winner. (to Beavis) Sir,
               your chips?
     
                         BEAVIS
               I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.
     
                         DEALER
               Let it ride!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (to dealer)
               Uh... could you help us find a chick?
     
                         DEALER
                         (uneasy)
               Sir, the casino does not partake in that
               kind of activity.
     
     The wheel stops.
     
                         DEALER (CONT.)
                         (amazed)
               13! Winner!
     
     People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch.
     
     Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.
     
                         CHERYL
               Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say 
               you're looking for a date?
     
     B&B freeze, shocked.
     
                         CHERYL (CONT.)
               I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real
               fine time.
     
     B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.
     
                         CHERYL (CONT.)
               A time you'll remember for the rest of
               your lives, if you know what I mean.
     
                         DEALER
                         (to Beavis)
               Sir, do you want your chips?
     
                         BEAVIS
               No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!
     
                         DEALER
               Let it ride.
     
     Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.
     
                         CHERYL
               What say we three go up to your room, 
               take off our clothes and just see what
               comes up.
     
     B&B's eyes open wide.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh... Uh...
     
     The wheel stops.
     
                         DEALER
               14. No winners.
     
                         CHERYL
               Hmmmm. Oh well.
     
     She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That chick was talking
               about doing it.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh. This is the best night of our
               lives.
     
     WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.
     
     MUSIC FADES BACK UP...
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
     
     ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song.
     
     Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out.
     
     B&B dance alone near the stage, doing the "butt-knocker."
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.
     
                         WOMAN ATTENDANT
               Good evening. Room service. How may
               I help you?
     
     From the phone...
     
                         B&B
                         (on phone)
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     The woman's disturbed.
     
                         WOMAN ATTENDANT
               Hello... Hello...
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
     
     B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue. 
     Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor 
     hard.
     
     
     INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the 
     toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh, I'd like to be serviced...
               in my room.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
     
     B&B keep dancing as the famous BAND plays the MONTAGE SONG which 
     ENDS.
     
     
     EXT.  VEGAS - DAWN
     
     Sunrise.
     
     The song rings out.
     
     
     INT.  B&B'S ROOM - MORNING
     
     BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it 
     and moving the whole thing.
     
     Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.
     
     Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's 
     one of those double doors to the next room.
     
     Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.
     
     Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B 
     inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
     
     She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight 
     leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (excited)
               Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.
     
                         DALLAS
               All right, who are ya? C.I.A? F.B.I.?
               A.T.F.?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Me first?
     
                         DALLAS
               You got two seconds!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
     
     Dallas grabs Butt-Head by the shirt.
     
                         DALLAS
               Who sent ya?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we
               could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
     
                         DALLAS
               Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he
               payin' ya?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, ten uh...
     
                         DALLAS
               Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a
               better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll
               pay ya twenty if you go back there and do
               mah husband.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No
               way.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (considering it)
               Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is
               a lot of money... Maybe if we close our
               eyes and pretend he's a chick...
     
     Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses.
     
     From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window. 
     The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
     
                         DALLAS
                         (panics)
               Damn! You boys, you wait right there.
     
     Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door.
     
     B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Me first! Me first!
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
     
     Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside.
     
     Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's 
     surrounded.
     
     As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On 
     the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.
     
                         DALLAS
                         (to phone)
               Gimme the number for Dream America Tours.
               (pause) Right.
     
     Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both 
     standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose. 
     Dallas closes the door again.
     
                         DALLAS (CONT.)
                         (to phone)
               Yeah, you got a bus leaving today? (pause)
               Five minutes? Where's it goin'? (listens)
               Washington, D.C.? (mulls it over) Perfect.
               (a look back to the other room) Gimme two
               tickets.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
     
     B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed. 
     Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table.
     
     Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms 
     over Butt-Head.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Me first!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Forget it, bunghole!
     
     B&B start to wrestle. Dallas sees Beavis' pants.
     
                         DALLAS
                         (realizing)
               Score? You boys wanna...?
     
     Butt-Head grabs Beavis' neck.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh.
     
     She picks up the pants, getting an idea.
     
                         DALLAS
               You wait here.
     
     She takes the pants into the next room. B&B keep wrestling.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Me first.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh. No way, dude.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
     
     TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate 
     electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card. 
     An LED light blinks.
     
     Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' 
     pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit 
     in.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
     
     B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at 
     Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
     
     Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly 
     threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into 
     the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose 
     as if she has smelled something.
     
     She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the 
     unit.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
     
     B&B fight wildly. Dallas enters and clears her throat. B&B freeze.
     
     FULL ON DALLAS, posed sexily, seductive.
     
                         DALLAS
               Don't wear yourselves out, boys. Save
               some energy for me.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're 
               finally gonna score.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh. Thank God.
     
                         DALLAS
               I'm gonna do it with both of ya.
     
                         B&B
                         (uncontrollable)
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
               huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     Dallas clears her throat to get their attention. And again.
     
                         DALLAS
               (sexy) Boys... (shouts) Boys!!!
     
     Silence.
     
                         DALLAS (CONT.)
               But first, you hafta do a little job for
               me. (touches seductively) Would you like
               to do a job for me?
     
     Silence. They're in shock.
     
                         DALLAS (CONT.)
               Here's what it is. I want ya to take a bus
               ta Washington, D.C. That's all. And when
               ya get there, I'll be waitin'. You're
               gonna make a whole lotta money. (In their
               faces) And I'm gonaa give you everything!
     
                         B&B
                         (near comatose)
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         DALLAS
               Until then... (tosses Beavis' pants in his
               face) Keep your pants on.
     
     She looks back to the window, now all business.
     
                         DALLAS (CONT.)
               OK guys, time to move out.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY/FRONT DOOR - DAY
     
     A.T.F. agents enter and spread out. We see several agents go up 
     the stairs.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' ROOM/DOORWAY - DAY
     
                         DALLAS
               Remember, Washington, D.C. You'll get
               more money than you ever dreamed of. And
               you'll get me.
     
     She kisses them both seductively.
     
                         DALLAS (CONT.)
                         (urgent)
               Your bus is downstairs. Get going.
     
     She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her 
     cart passes by.
     
     B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.
     
     ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator 
     doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick 
     open Dallas' door.
     
     
     EXT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
     
     More Feds and police enter.
     
     ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks 
     away, Beavis rubs his butt.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This is gonna be cool. Huh huh.
     
     They walk to the tour bus across the street.
     
     
     INT.  TOUR BUS - DAY
     
     B&B walk down the aisle, Beavis rubbing his butt. Most seats are 
     taken by senior citizens.
     
     Up ahead, two vacant seats. B&B fight to get in first.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               No way butt-hole! I want the window.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Cut it out butt-hole!
     
                         A VOICE
               Why don't you take turns?
     
     They turn. It's Martha, the woman from the plane, sitting across 
     the aisle.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the
               plane!
     
                         MARTHA
               Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh, we didn't score yet.
     
                         MARTHA
               Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cool, huh huh huh.
     
                         MARTHA
               That's why I'm bussing it across America.
               I'm so glad you're here. (to man in next
               seat) Jim, I want you to meet two nice
               boys.
     
     JIM, an old guy, wakes up and looks over.
     
                         MARTHA (CONT.)
               This is Travis and Bob... What's your
               last name, dear?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's
               Butt. Huh huh huh.
     
                         JIM
               Pleased to meet ya, Mr. Head.
     
     All the seniors turn around to meet them.
     
                         MARTHA
               Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed.
               And Doreen.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
     
     
     EXT.  TOUR BUS - DAY
     
     It takes off.
     
     We PAN back to the hotel as Muddy arrives in a cab.
     
     
     INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE DALLAS' ROOM - DAY
     
     DRAMATIC REVEAL of AGENT RYAN FLEMMING entering the hallway. He's 
     an A.T.F. honcho, powerful, hard-ass. Looks like an Oliver North-
     type. Sounds something like Fred Thompson. He walks with his 
     assistant, AGENT BORK and another agent.
     
     They find Dallas' room and enter.
     
     
     INT.  DALLAS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Dallas sits calmly, confident, as agents tear apart the room.
     
                         FLEMMING
               So, are you going to tell us where it is
               or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley
               over there give you another cavity search?
     
     ANGLE ON AGENT HURLEY, a tough, stocky woman.

               Ooh is that a promise?
     
                         FLEMMING
               Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell
               her Bork.
     
                         BORK
               Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes.
               You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.
     
     He tosses her some photos of her and Muddy.
     
                         DALLAS
               Oh, you got my bad side.
     
     Bork hands Flemming another file. Flemming checks it.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Three days ago you pulled a job at the
               Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada -
               where you stole... (reads) The X-5 unit.
               Now we happen to know you had the unit
               with you when you checked in here, so why
               don't you be a good girl and tell us where
               it is.
     
                         DALLAS
               You gonna charge me with anything? (pause)
               I didn't think so. You wanna let me go now
               or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful
               arrest.
     
                         BORK
                         (aside to Flemming)
               We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
               apart. We can only legally hold her for
               another couple of hours.
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (aside to Bork)
               Dammit! (slams fist down) Where's that
               damn unit??!!

     B&B are excited.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh. We're in Washington!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
     
                         MARTHA
               Actually, we're at the Hoover Dam.
     
     Martha walks on down the aisle.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Damn, huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
     
     They follow the seniors out of the bus. Beavis rubs his butt.
     
     
     EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY
     
     Dallas drives by in a slick car.

     She adjusts her rearview mirror to observe a Fed car following 
     her. She smiles.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM - DAY
     
     B&B and the seniors are on a tour through the giant basement. B&B 
     talk and approach the HOOVER GUIDE, speaking nearby.
     
                         BEAVIS
               So, like, where is she?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (looks around)
               Yeah, really.
     
                         HOOVER GUIDE
               Over 40 thousand cubic tons of concrete
               were used in the construction of the
               Hoover Dam.
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

               From top to bottom, this dam is 51
               stories.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh, huh huh, excuse me. Is this a God
               Damn?
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     They follow the tour into the next room.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/OBSERVATION ROOM - DUSK
     
     A glass wall separates this from the master control room. There, 
     two technicians are on watch. Banks of monitors show the water and 
     pipes from various angles.
     
     B&B are the last in. Beavis rubs his aching butt. The guide is 
     already speaking.
     
                         HOOVER GUIDE
               ... Generates over 6000 gigawatts of

     The tour moves on.

               This is dumb, let's find that chick.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
     
     They walk back from where they came.
     
     Through the glass wall, we see the two control room technicians 
     heading out.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cool! Huh huh huh.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/HALL OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM DOOR - DUSK
     
     SOUND of air compression as this secure door opens. The two 
     technicians walk out.
     
     They walk away, not seeing that behind them, B&B approach the 
     control room door. They enter just before the door closes. SOUND 
     of air compression locks.
     
     
     INT.  A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS/FLEMMING'S OFFICE - DUSK
     
     Agent Bork knocks and enters.

               Talk ta me, Bork.
     
                         BORK
               Chief, we found a witness that says he saw
               two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly
               before we arrived.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Did you give him a full cavity search?
     
                         BORK
                         (confused)
               Ah, the witness?
     
                         FLEMMING
               Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
     
                         BORK
               Well sir, I didn't really think it was
               necessary. You see we have a picture of
               them from the elevator security cam. Here,
               have a look.
     
     TIGHT ON PICTURE. A still of B&B laughing on the elevator.
     
                         BORK (CONT.)
               They look like a couple of kids chief.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Bork, don't you realize what kids today
               are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
     
     Suddenly the lights blink on and off. All three men look up.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
     
     We see a bank of TV monitors, video of water, turbines, etc. 
     Beavis is rubbing his butt against a switch on the console, 
     causing the lights to blink on and off.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
     
                         BEAVIS
               My butt's bothering me!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh
               huh.
     
     Butt-Head looks at the bank of monitors - all showing water.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               Dammit, all they have is shows about
               water.
     
                         BEAVIS
               That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows
               about fire! Change the channel.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh...
     
     Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis 
     rubs his butt against a computer keypad.
     
     TIGHT ON CONTROL:  "Main Water Release Valve". Butt-Head turns it. 
     An alarm sounds.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, turn it up! Louder! Heh heh.
     
     
     INT.  DAM DOORS - DUSK
     
     An alarm sounds. Giant doors open, causing water to start to flood 
     through the gates.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
     
     Butt-Head presses more buttons. His hand is near the biggest 
     switch for: "Master Station Control".
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (reads sign)
               Uh... Mas... Ter... Huh huh. Masturbation,
               huh huh.
     
     Butt-Head throws the switch. Lights go out. SOUND of generators 
     grinding to a halt.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/MACHINE ROOM - DUSK
     
     Machinery stops suddenly and large support beams break. A 
     disaster.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
     
     SOUND of twisted, grinding metal, loud alarms.

               Uh...
     
     ON ONE OF THE MONITORS, we see a small electrical fire.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, fire! Fire! FIRE!!!

     The lights go out.

     In succession, one set of lights after another goes out. The 
     famous strip goes dark.
     
     
     INT.  A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS/FLEMMING'S OFFICE - DUSK
     
     The lights go dead.

     EXT.  CAMPGROUND - DUSK
     
     Marcy Anderson hammers the last peg in for their tent. Tom checks 
     the stew on the fire and looks around.
     
                         TOM
               I'll tell ya, it doesn't get any better
               than this. This here is God's country.
               Unspoiled and...
     
     A rumbling interrupts him. He and Marcy turn to see:
     
     A wall of water, heading for them.
     
                         TOM (CONT.)
               Aaaaghhh!!!...
     
     They're smashed by the flood.
     
     
     EXT.  HOOVER DAM - DUSK
     
     Mass chaos. Traffic jams. Honking horns. People shouting.
     
     ANGLE ON B&B AND THE SENIORS, about to get on the bus.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               That was boring. Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, it's just the same thing over and
               over again.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we
               find that chick.
     
                         MARTHA
               Oh, we're a long ways from Washington Bob.
               This is the Hoover Dam.
     
     Martha gets on the bus. HOLD ON B&B.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Damn! Heh heh hmm heh.
     
     They get on the bus.
     
     
     INT.  VEGAS HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK
     
     Mayhem. People scream in the dark. Some steal chips and run.
     
     ANGLE TO SIDE, where Muddy has the Concierge by the neck.
     
                         CONCIERGE
               I swear, that's all I know! They got on
               that tour bus. It was probably heading 
               west. Please...
     
     Muddy slams him against the wall and walks away.
     
                         MUDDY
               I'm gonna kill 'em!
     
     
     EXT.  HOOVER DAM - DUSK
     
     The doors close on the tour bus. It pulls out and drives away.
     
     
     EXT.  SIDE OF ROAD - DUSK
     
     At her car, Dallas watches the bus from a distance, then lays down 
     her binoculars, satisfied.
     
                         DALLAS
               You boys better show up.
     
     With a look at the Fed car behind her, she gets in her car and 
     drives down a different road.
     
     
     EXT.  ROAD - DUSK
     
     The bus heads off into the desert.

     EXT.  HOOVER DAM - MORNING
     
     Police cars everywhere. Fire engines. Reporters. News helicopters. 
     Disaster.
     
     Several A.T.F. cars pull up. Flemming and several of his agents 
     get out and head immediately for the dam.
     
     
     INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
     
     TIGHT ON A TV MONITOR. It shows B&B at the Hoover Dam controls the 
     eve before, shot on surveillance camera. Frame freezes. B&B 
     looking particularly stupid.
     
     REVEAL Flemming's there with his agents. Flemming leans forward.
     
                         FLEMMING
               You see what I see, Bork?
     
                         BORK
               I see it. I don't get it.
     
                         FLEMMING
               You got half the state looking for ya -
               how do you get away?
     
                         BORK
                         (realizes)
               Cut the power!
     
                         FLEMMING
               Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real
               pros here. My opinion, terrorists...
               What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
     
                         BORK
               Well, sir it's not good. (to an assistant)
               Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new
               top-secret biological weapon, a manmade
               virus...
     
     ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.
     
                         BORK (CONT.)
               The deadliest known to man. It could wipe
               out five states in five days. It can be
               activated by simply entering the right
               code. Here's what happened when it was
               tested on a group of Army recruits...
     
     ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling 
     around in pain on stretchers, dying. Grotesque (but funny).
     
                         FLEMMING
               Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
               fall into the wrong hands...
     
                         BORK
               It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished.
               It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard
               enough, it could break open, releasing the
               virus.
     
     A murmuring through the room. Flemming rises and holds up a 
     picture of B&B.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Okay People, as of right now these are the
               most dangerous men in America. I want
               these faces in front of every Fed and two-
               bit sheriff within a thousand miles. The
               orders are dead or alive. Let's just pray
               that nothing hits that unit.
     
     
     INT.  TOUR BUS - DAY
     
     TIGHT ON Beavis' butt, as Butt-head KICKS IT REPEATEDLY.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.

                         (a la Carl Sagan)
               There are over two hundred active geysers
               in Yellowstone Park alone. Old Faithful
               here is one of the largest. During an 
               eruption the water can reach as high as
               two hundred feet!...

               It shoots out over twelve thousand gallons
               of water in a single eruption...
     
                         BEAVIS
               That's not that much.

               Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis.
               Huh huh huh. This sucks.

     benches where they wait for the geyser to erupt.

     REVEAL they're standing before the urinals. Butt-Head moves to the 
     side, tripping a motion detector which makes the urinal 
     AUTOMATICALLY FLUSH.

     Suddenly the guide sees B&B's photo, then, out the window, the bus 
     closing its door and pulling away.

     IN MONTAGE SHOTS:
     
     A.T.F. agents put up roadblocks.
     
     Agents load guns.
     
     Agents pile up sandbags and prepare for battle.
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT - DAY
     
     WIDE SHOT. A wasteland. Scorching desert hear. B&B, small in 
     frame, look lost. They're parched, weak.
     
                         BEAVIS
               This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This desert is stupid. They need to put a
               drinking fountain out here.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or
               something... Are we almost there?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, probably like, another five minutes or
               something.
     
     ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B wobble like they haven't 
     long to live. Overhead, vultures circle.
     
     ANGLE ON B&B, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly 
     sees something.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               Whoa! Check it out!
     
     Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.
     
                         B&B
               Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
     
     Excited, saved, they rush weakly forward.
     
     B&B'S P.O.V. REVEALS they rush to: A GIANT BIG SCREEN TV.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Turn it on! Turn it on!
     
     As they get closer it disappears - just a mirage.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
     
     ANGLE ON SUN, brightening. The FRAME WHITES OUT.
     
     
     EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY
     
     Cars are backed up into the horizon.
     
     The car up front is waved on. Up next: Tom and Marcy. An agent 
     steps over and shows the picture of B&B.
     
                         TOM
               Something wrong, Officer?
     
                         AGENT
               Sir, we're looking for these two
               fugitives.
     
     ANDERSON SQUINTS to see.
     
     HIS P.O.V. REVEALS the photo out of focus.
     
                         ANDERSON
               Why I'll be danged. It's those boys been
               whackin' off in my camper...
     
                         AGENT
               You saw these two?
     
                         ANDERSON
               I sure did. They were whackin' off in my
               tool shed. Then whackin' off in my camper.
               I never seen so much whackin' off.
     
     The agent steps back and shouts into his walkie-talkie:
     
                         AGENT
               Blue Den this is post nine! I have
               positive ID!! (to Tom) Sir, I'm gonna have
               to ask you and your wife to step out of
               the vehicle.
     
                         ANDERSON
               Well you see, me and the missus are on our
               way to Washington. We got this schedule...
     
     The agent pulls his gun and orders:
     
                         AGENT
               Now!!!!
     
     
     EXT.  SIDE OF HIGHWAY/JUST OFF ROADBLOCK - DAY
     
     A BIT LATER. Agents swarm over Tom's camper, turning everything 
     upside, pulling out dishes, trashing everything.
     
                         TOM
                         (furious)
               Now wait right there. You're dealing with
               a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the
               ones been whacking off. If I find anything
               broken in there, you and I are gonna
               tangle!
     
     An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through 
     the pieces.
     
     Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (appalled)
               Masturbating in a man's camper! We're
               dealing with two sick individuals. I want
               that camper torn apart, full cavity
               searches all around.
     
     SNAP! SFX as Agent Hurley puts on her rubber gloves and leads Tom 
     and Marcy away.
     
     Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
     
                         BORK
               Chief - just came in! Two days ago,
               Express Airways had a disturbance by
               someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess
               who matches the description?
     
     He holds up a police sketch of Cornholio. Flemming walks to a 
     nearby chopper. SOUND of engine revving. Others follow.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Finally, a real break. Get me that
               flight's point of origin. We're gonna kick
               some ass.
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT - DAY
     
     B&B walk along in the scorching heat. Ahead of them they see a 
     DUMB GUY and a DUMBER GUY with motorcycles parked. They are trying 
     to start a camp fire, LAUGHING.
     
                         DUMB GUY
                         (to B&B)
               Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (dehydrated)
               Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
     
     
     INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
     
     Peaceful. Empty. Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents break in, guns 
     ready, searching every corner. They tear it apart.
     
     
     EXT.  B&B'S TOWN/STREETS - DAY
     
     Agents rush down the business streets. People are in a panic. It's 
     like an invasion.
     
     ANGLE ON ELITE MOTOR LODGE - ON B&B'S TV SET as agents rush by, 
     knocking it over with a crash.
     
     
     INT.  VAN DRIESSEN'S CLASS - DAY
     
     Guitar in hand, Van Driessen sings:
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               She flies so gracefully,
               over rocks, trees and sand. Soaring over
               cliffs and gently
               floating down to land.
               She proudly lifts her voice
               to sound her mating call.
               And soon her mate responds
               by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw."
               Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.
               Settle down and rest with me...
     
     Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents crash into the room. The door 
     bashes in, knocking Van Driessen down hard and crushing his 
     guitar.
     
     Flemming enters. Behind him, McVicker.
     
                         McVICKER
               Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their
               teacher.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               What's going on here?
     
                         FLEMMING
               I'll ask the questions. Are these your
               students?
     
     He shows a picture of B&B.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               I assume you're a government agent. I
               would think you would know there's
               something in this country called due
               process.
     
                         FLEMMING
               That's about the kind of talk I'd expect
               from the guy who taught these two. Take
               this scum away.
     
                         VAN DRIESSEN
               I believe I'm supposed to be read my
               Miranda Rights...
     
     An agent interrupts, punching Van Driessen in the gut. He's taken 
     away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker.
     
                         McVICKER
               I...I...I always knew they were no good.
               I... I... I hate them!
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (to McVicker)
               You've been harboring two criminal
               masterminds!
     
     Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.
     
                         BORK
               Chief, you know that guy whose camper they
               were whacking off in?
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (appalled)
               Bork! You are a federal agent. You
               represent the United States Government...
               Never end a sentence with a preposition.
               Try again.
     
                         BORK
               Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose
               camper they... I mean that guy off in
               whose camper they were whacking?
     
                         FLEMMING
               That's better. Yes?
     
                         BORK
               We've run a sample through the National
               Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two
               possible genetic matches for a father.
               (holds up photos)
     
     TIGHT ON PHOTO. It's the DUMB GUY and DUMBER GUY from the desert.
     
                         BORK (O.S./CONT.)
               Former Motley Crue members turned
               drifters.
     
     Flemming takes the paper and marches off. Others follow.
     
     DISSOLVE TO:
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT
     
     B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. 
     The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
     Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from 
     Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's.
     
     Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
     the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, 
     hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
     
                         DUMB GUY
                         (mouth full)
               Yup. Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Fire.
     
                         DUMB GUY
               Here's another true story. About fifteen
               years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
               called Highland...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Really? That's where we're from.
     
                         DUMB GUY
               Well, then you know what I'm talking
               about. Anyway, here's the story. I
               scored with these two chicks. True story.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               You scored with two chicks?!
     
                         DUMB GUY
                         (spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
               Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
     
                         DUMBER GUY
               Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
     
     Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
     
                         DUMB GUY
               Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
               scored with both of them...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, do you think these two sluts still
               live in Highland? That would be cool.
     
                         DUMB GUY
                         (after taking another big bite)
               Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
               Huh huh huh.
     
     Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to 
     drop his pants.
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
     
     The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant 
     sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange 
     fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
     
                         B&B/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY (O.S.)
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.

               Fire.
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT - MORNING
     
     B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is 
     scorching.
     
     B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
     
     ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at 
     the sun, squinting.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (barely alive)
               The sun sucks.
     
     A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
     
                         BEAVIS
                         (to the vulture)
               Cut it out butt-hole!
     
     The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
               like, water in cactuses?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (semiconscious)
               Uh...
     
     Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
                         (sees something)
               Hey Beavis, check it out.
     
     IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.
     
                         B&B
                         (struggling to laugh)
               Huh huh huh (cough) huh huh (cough).
     
     
     EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY
     
     START ON SUN - over B&B?
     
     REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B held by an 
     A.T.F. agent.
     
                         MUDDY
               No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
               it's safe to drive around here.
     
                         COP
               Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
               roads. If they're around, they're probably
               hiding out in the desert.
     
                         MUDDY
               That's good to know, Officer.
     
     Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
     
     
     EXT.  DESERT - LATER
     
     B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're 
     barely able to talk.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
               life is like, flashing in front of my
               eyes!
     
     BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him 
     sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the 
     exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Whoa, my life is cool!
     
     TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
               It's like a really long time ago...
     
     BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. 
     It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
     
                         BEAVIS/SPERM
               Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
     
     Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
     
     With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
     
                         BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
               Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
     
     Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His 
     conception looks like a dumb accident.
     
     BACK ON BEAVIS:
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, heh heh I scored.
     
     Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
               I think I'm freaking out.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh? Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
               everything looks all weird and...
     
     BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors 
     start shifting.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               ...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
               all these weird shapes and it's sort of
               like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
     
     Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
     
     THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
     could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
     lower left hand corner.
     
     I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
     something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
     is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
     fire!"
     
     The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
     I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
     Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
     
     BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
     
     We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
     The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
     
                         FIRE
               I am God of Hellfire and I bring
               you...(music begins) Fire...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
     
     THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
     of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
     
     At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
     bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
     
     As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
     of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird 
     stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
     
     At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
     
     As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
     surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
     maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
     movie.)
     
     Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead 
     bodies.
     
     The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not 
     far from the side of a road all along.
     
                         B&B
               Ahhhhghhhhgh!
     
     B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
     with a shotgun.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
               Heh heh heh. Water.
     
     Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.
     
                         MUDDY
               Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
               b'fore ah kill ya?
     
     B&B think.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
               cheeks, huh huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say
               that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
     
                         MUDDY
               Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cool, huh huh. (realizing) Hey Beavis
               that's that dude that's paying us to do
               his wife.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Oh yeah. Can you just take us to
               Washington? We're gonna meet her there
               and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
     
                         MUDDY
               Washington! That's where she was gonna
               meet up with ya? (realizes) Damn, she's
               goin' all the way!
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
     
                         MUDDY
               You know, I just might need you after all.
               Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
               me get mah unit back.
     
     Muddy pops it open. B&B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them 
     and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
               Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh

     Muddy peels out.

               Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.

     ANGLE OUTSIDE MUDDY'S TRUNK. From within we hear:
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (O.C.)
               Hey, Beavis, check it out. I'm jacking
               off!
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to 
     bend.
     
     Suddenly, it pops open. B&B are a sweaty mess. They gasp.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               This sucks. Let's get outta here.
     
     They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis 
     stares dumbly.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Uh, you first.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               C'mon, Beavis, just start running really
               fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Okay. I'll go right after you.
     
     Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Ahhhhghghhghghgh!
     
     Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over - 
     and smashes his butt.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Owwwwww, my butt!!!!!!
     
     His body stops in the middle of the road. A huge truck, about to 
     hit him, swerves and jackknifes over the side.
     
     Behind the truck, several cars screech to a halt, one smashing 
     into the other.

     Butt-Head looks at the road.

               Huh huh huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
     ANGLE ON MUDDY'S TIRE. It hits a pothole.
     
     ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, shooting out of the trunk, he grabs onto the 
     lid. He bounces against the road again and again.
     
     Finally, he loses his grip as the lid to the trunk closes.
     
     ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, rolling along the highway.
     
     A car, about to hit Butt-Head, screeches to a halt. Other cars 
     behind it smash and pile up.

               alone with them two little bastards...

     crashes into it. And the car behind crashes into Tom.

     Flemming, Bork, and about six other agents look at a map. Behind 
     them, a TV is on with the reporter continuing. Behind the 
     reporter, B&B poke their heads into frame at 45 degree angles, 
     looking like deer in the headlights.
     
                         REPORTER (CONT.)
               ... Behind me, over 400 vehicles lay
               wrecked or stuck. No one knows what caused
               it, but police have not ruled out the
               possibility of terrorists.
     
     Bork notices B&B on TV and taps Flemming on the shoulder. Flemming 
     looks.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

               Where did these guys come from?
     
     Flemming looks at the big map which traces sightings of B&B across 
     America.
     
                         FLEMMING
               The question is, where are they going.
     
     He looks again at the TV. On the news, a story about...

               what would happen if they set that thing
               off in our nation's capital, or even
               worse, if they sold it to some damned
               foreigner at that conference. (rises and

                         SENATOR
               Thank you for returning, Senator Packwood,
               to help us understand how sexual
               harassment happens in this sacred
               institution.
     
     Suddenly, SOUND OF BUTT-HEAD over the PA.

               Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking
               for that chick with the big boobs.

               Heh heh. We wanna do her now!

     Muddy finishes tying Dallas' hands behind her back. He crosses to 
     his trunk.
     
                         MUDDY
               You forgot who yer dealin' with, Honey. Ya
               see, I got your mules right here in my
               trunk and...
     
     Muddy pops the trunk. It's empty.
     
                         MUDDY (CONT.)
               Say what?... I'm gonna kill 'em!!!
     
                         DALLAS
               No honey we're gonna kill 'em.

                         BEAVIS
               Hey wait a minute. What's going on? Why
               are we getting back on the bus?
     
                         OLD GUY
               It's time to go son.
     
                         BEAVIS
               We can't leave! We never met that chick!
               Dammit!!! We were supposed to get some!
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle
               down! Not this time!...
     
     Beavis is shaking, fed up. He delivers the speech of his life.
     
                         BEAVIS (CONT.)
               Dammit, this always happens! I think I'm
               gonna score and then I never score! It's
               not fair! We've traveled a hundred miles
               'cause we thought we were gonna score, but
               now it's not gonna happen!
     
                         BUS DRIVER
                         (yelling from his seat)
               Hey buddy, sit down! Now!
     
                         BEAVIS
               SHUT UP! (continuing) I'm sick and tired
               of this! We're never gonna score! It's
               just not gonna happen! We're just gonna
               get old like these people, but they've
               probably scored!
     
                         BUS DRIVER
                         (standing)
               Hey! I'm warning you! Sit down!
     
                         BEAVIS
               It's like this chick's a slut (motioning
               to Martha)... and look at this guy!...
               He's old but he's probably scored a
               million times!
     
                         OLD GUY
                         (nods in agreement)
               Ohh yeah.
     
                         BEAVIS
               But not us! We're never gonna score! WE'RE

               it.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Oh I don't huh? How about lewd conduct?
               Maybe indecent exposure?...
               Here's what's gonna happen. One of you's
               gonna make a deal and get me the unit. The
               other can spend the next sixty years in
               jail.
     
                         MUDDY
               There you're wrong, boy. Me and mah wife
               are back together and you'll never...
     
                         DALLAS

                         MUDDY

     The driver sits down and drives on.
     
     Beavis is slightly beat up. Martha reaches into her purse, filled 
     with prescription medications.
     
                         MARTHA
               Now Travis, it doesn't do a body good to
               get all worked up. Here. This should help
               you relax.
     
     She holds up a box of NoDrowz and squints at the label.
     
                         MARTHA
               Does that say Xanax?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.

     As the tour moves on, Beavis stays behind. He goes over to a 
     coffee-serving cart sitting outside a meeting room. He starts 
     WOLFING DOWN SUGAR CUBES.
     
     BACK ON THE TOUR:
     
     The tour is led by a smiling guide, SANDY.

               This is the East Room. Many of the

               set by the British in 1814...

     Beavis now has his T-shirt pulled over his head and is pacing 
     around and babbling. He's too loud now for Sandy to ignore.

                         LIEUTENANT
               Yes, Mr. President.

               bunghole! I am Cornholio!
     
                         LIEUTENANT
               Mr. President, I can't make out what
               you're saying.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
                         (on phone)
               Bungholio! Presidente! I need teepee!
     
     A GENERAL comes by.
     
                         LIEUTENANT
                         (to general)
               Sir, the President sounds strange.
               Something's going on. I don't think it's a
               drill.
     
                         GENERAL
               Washington may be under attack. Go to
               Defcon 4.
     
     ANGLE ON LIEUTENANT'S HAND, moving to push a button. Alarms sound.
     
     ANGLE ON BIG MAP. A sign flashes: DEFCON 4. Soldiers run through 
     frame.
     
     
     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     The seniors, along with other tourists and dignitaries are 
     escorted out of the building.
     
     
     INT.  WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY
     
     A.T.F. agents rush by. We HOLD here after they go. Butt-Head walks 
     by, unaware.
     
     Butt-Head walks around and opens a door. The door to CHELSEA 
     CLINTON'S room.
     
     Inside, she's folding clothes. (NOTE: If Clinton is not reelected, 
     the shot will be wider, revealing she's packing a suitcase)
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (excited)
               Whoa! Huh huh uh,... (suave) Hey, baby.
               Huh huh, I noticed you have braces. So do
               I, huh huh.
     
     
     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     We HOLD ON A WIDE SHOT of the back of the White House for a beat. 
     Then:
     
     We see Butt-Head come CRASHING out of a second-story window - 
     thrown by Chelsea. He lands deep in the bushes below.
     
     ANGLE ON the bushes.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. That was cool.
     
     We see Butt-Head slowly emerge from the bushes. He looks up, 
     suddenly seeing:
     
     DOZENS OF A.T.F. AGENTS surround him, rifles trained.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (awestruck)
               This is the coolest thing I have ever
               seen.
     
     Flemming steps up.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Alright, where's the unit?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, in my pants?
     
     Bork and others quickly frisk Butt-head.
     
                         BORK
               Not on him, Chief.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Agent Hurley...
     
     Hurley steps forward.
     
                         FLEMMING (CONT.)
               ... I want you to give this scumbag a
               cavity search. I'm talking Roto-Rooter.
               Don't stop 'till you reach the back of his
               teeth.
     
     Butt-Head is led away.
     
     
     INT.  OVAL OFFICE - DAY
     
     Beavis is on the red phone. He goes through the President's 
     drawers.
     
                         LIEUTENANT
                         (on phone)
               Mr. President, the bombers are scrambled.
               Sir, we're awaiting your final orders.

     INT.  STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND - DAY
     
     The General grabs the phone from the Lieutenant.
     
                         GENERAL
               Gimme that! (to phone) Mr. President, in
               the name of all that is holy, I must have
               those launch codes!
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
                         (on phone)
               Are you threatening me? Bungholio!
     
     Click. Beavis hangs up.
     
     
     INT.  WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY
     
     Beavis walks out of the Oval Office.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Presidente Bungholio! You will cooperate
               with my bunghole!
     
     
     INT.  A.T.F. VAN - DAY
     
     Hurley steps out of a van to speak with Flemming and Bork. She 
     pulls off a LONG GLOVE that goes almost to her shoulder.
     
     Butt-Head sits, disheveled.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh, did I just score?
     
                         HURLEY
               He's clean, chief.
     
                         FLEMMING
               The other guy must have it. He's gotta be
               in here somewhere. (re: Butt-Head) Bring
               him.
     
     Flemming, Bork and the other agents take off.
     
     
     INT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     In the main reception area, Beavis is surrounded by a few FOREIGN 
     DIGNITARIES who try to make sense of what he is saying.
     
                         DIGNITARY #1
               Que es un "bunghole"? Que lengua es?
               Arabigo?
     
                         DIGNITARY #2
               De donde eres tu?
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Arabigo? I am the Great Cornholio. I have
               no bunghole. Where I come from there is no
               T.P.
     
     A White House representative comes up. He assumes Beavis is with 
     the dignitaries.
     
                         REPRESENTATIVE
               I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience
               gentlemen, but we're going to have
               outside for a moment. Follow me please.
     
     He leads them out, including Beavis who continues to babble.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               You can run but you cannot hide from the
               Almighty Bunghole! Heh heh hmm.
     
     
     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     Beavis/Cornholio and the dignitaries are escorted out. Beavis, 
     unnoticed, keeps walking.
     
     Beavis, walking along stops. He sees something.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Aaaaahh...
     
     ON BEAVIS' P.O.V. across the street, we see what Beavis is looking 
     at:
     
     ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
     
     ANGLE ON BEAVIS. He takes the picture of Dallas out of his pocket.
     
     TIGHT ON the picture of Dallas.
     
     TIGHT ON Anderson's camper.
     
     TIGHT ON Beavis.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (CONT.)
               Aaaahh, heh heh...
     
     Beavis looks alternately at the camper and the picture a couple of 
     times, and then walks across the street.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (CONT.)
               Booiiing! Ptang ptang! Wagh-hah!!!
     
     Beavis goes into Anderson's camper and shuts the door.
     
     A Secret Service agent walks by, just missing Beavis.
     
     
     INT.  WHITE HOUSE/CORRIDOR OF PRESIDENTS - DAY
     
     Tom and Marcy enjoying a moment.
     
                         TOM
               Boy I tell ya what, it really makes ya
               proud. I could stay here all day.
     
     An A.T.F. agent comes up and interrupts Tom.
     
                         AGENT
               Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave...
     
                         TOM
               Now wait just a minute...
     
                         AGENT
               Now!
     
     NEARBY, Flemming and Bork are showing the police sketch of 
     Cornholio to Sandy and questioning her.
     
     Bork sees Anderson walk by from a distance.
     
                         BORK
               Say chief, isn't that guy whose
               camper,...I mean, off in whose...

                         (irritated)
               Not now Bork.
     
     
     EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DAY
     
     From inside the camper we hear THE STRANGEST CORNHOLIO SOUNDS YET.
     
     ANGLE ON the front of the camper. Tom and Marcy walk up.
     
                         TOM
               I tell ya what honey, this country's goin'
               to Hell in a handbasket.
     
     They get in the front. Tom adjusts the side-view mirror.
     
                         TOM (CONT.)
               I'm gonna go over right now and talk to my
               Congressman about this...
     
     TOM'S P.O.V.: In the side-view mirror we see the camper SHAKING 
     and hear Beavis/Cornholio.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (O.S.)
               Ooooaaaaaghhh!!! Whack-awhack-aaaaghh!!!
     
                         TOM
               What the hell?...Wait here a minute...
     
     Tom gets out and goes into the camper.
     
     HOLD ON THE CAMPER DOOR.
     
     Tom throws Beavis/Cornholio out the door. Beavis is in his 
     underwear with his T-shirt still pulled over his head.
     
                         TOM (CONT.)
               And if I ever catch ya whackin' in here
               again I'm gonna hog-tie ya! (to himself)
               Now I gotta straighten up in here.
     
     Tom goes back in the camper.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               You have offended my bunghole!
     
     
     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     Bork reports to Flemming. Butt-Head is held by two agents.
     
                         BORK
               We just cleared all four floors. No sign
               of him.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've
               found him by now.
     
     Bork sees something. It's Beavis, about a hundred yards away.
     
                         BORK
               Chief, look!
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (picks up radio)
               Attention all units. We've got him. He's
               in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
     
     
     EXT.  OUTSIDE ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DAY
     
     Beavis stands, T-shirt still over his head. Suddenly, dozens of 
     agents surround him, pointing guns at him. Beavis seems oblivious 
     to the danger.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste
               to your bunghole! Heh heh.
     
     BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
     
                         FLEMMING
               OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the
               unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't
               wanna take a chance on hitting it.
     
                         BORK
               Where are his pants?
     
                         FLEMMING
               Who knows?
     
     Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious.
     
     Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
     
                         FLEMMING (CONT.)
               This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't
               hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us
               where the unit is.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
     
                         FLEMMING
               We'll get you whatever you want. (to
               agents) Get that other kid. We might need
               him.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
     
                         BORK
                         (on a radio)
               This is Bork. We need some T.P. and
               some...(to Flemming) What's he say?
     
     ANGLE BEHIND AGENTS. Butt-Head is brought in by two agents.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Whoa, this rules! Can I have a gun too?
               Huh huh huh.
     
     ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               You must bow down to the Almighty
               Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
               (Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (to Bork)
               He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna
               have to take him out. Get ready to fire on
               my orders... (on bullhorn) This is your
               last chance. Give us the unit now...
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               (Beavis) Why does everyone wanna see my
               schlong? (Cornholio, chanting) I am the
               one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (to agents)
               OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of
               three. (on bullhorn) I'm gonna give you
               three seconds...
     
     ANGLE ON AGENTS taking aim, cocking their guns.
     
                         FLEMMING (CONT.)
                         (on bullhorn)
               One...
     
     ANGLE ON BEAVIS, chanting.
     
                         BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
               Cornholio-o-o-o-o...
     
     ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, huh huh huh.
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (on bullhorn)
               ...Two...

                         (on bullhorn)
               Thrr...
     
     Suddenly Tom Anderson throws open his camper door, holding Beavis' 
     pants.
     
                         TOM
               And take yer damn pants with ya...!
               (noticing) What in the hell...?

                         (pointing)
               THE PANTS!!! He's got the unit!
     
     Suddenly all guns are on Anderson.
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (through bullhorn)
               Drop the pants! Now!
     
                         TOM
               Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
     
     IN SLOW MOTION:
     
     A S.W.A.T. TEAM GUY lunges at Tom, grabbing the pants.
     
     Tom pulls away, causing the pants to RIP. THE UNIT GOES FLYING.
     
     A FROZEN MOMENT. SLOW MOTION.
     
     TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
     
     TIGHT ON FACES IN THE CROWD.
     
     TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
     
     TIGHT ON FLEMMING.
     
     TIGHT ON BUTT-HEAD, LAUGHING IN SLOW MOTION - OBLIVIOUS.
     
     TIGHT ON THE UNIT, FALLING, FALLING.
     
     IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS.
     
     The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do.
     
     Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
     
     The crowd CHEERS.
     
     ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
     
     Tom is handcuffed roughly.
     
                         TOM
               Now wait just a minute...
     
     An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork 
     grabs it and shows it to Tom.
     
                         BORK
               How do you explain this?
     
     Flemming approaches Tom.
     
                         FLEMMING
               Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as
               pawns in your sick game, huh?
     
                         TOM
               I don't know what the hell...
     
                         FLEMMING
                         (disgusted)
               Take him away.
     
     Anderson is dragged away past a group of young, boy-scout types 
     who shake their heads in shame.
     
     ANGLE ON Beavis and Butt-head being interviewed by a reporter. 
     Beavis is in his underwear. Tom is being dragged away in the 
     background.
     
                         BEAVIS
               I always thought there was something wrong
               with him. Heh heh heh.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh
               huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
                         (leaning towards camera)
               Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     DISSOLVE TO:
     
     
     EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
     
     Later. Establish. Most A.T.F. cars are pulling out.
     
     
     INT.  WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY
     
     B&B sit as Flemming paces in front of them. Beavis is no longer 
     Cornholio.
     
                         FLEMMING
               I gotta admit, I didn't believe it. I
               thought you were scum. But you saved more
               lives today than you'll ever know. You led
               us to one of the sickest criminals in our
               history. This country owes you a debt.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get
               money and stuff?
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to
               score.
     
                         FLEMMING
               For security reasons, your actions will
               have to remain top secret. But someone
               very special wants to give his thanks.
     
     Flemming motions to the big chair. The PRESIDENT swivels around 
     and rises to shake hands with B&B.
     
                         PRESIDENT
               Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all
               your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest
               thanks. You exemplify a fine new crop of
               young Americans who will grow into the
               leaders of this great country.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Huh huh huh. He said crap. Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh. This guy's cool.
     
                         PRESIDENT
               In recognition for your great service, I'm
               appointing you honorary agents in the
               Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Whoa, huh huh!!!
     
     The President hands them citations.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
               You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get
               alcohol, tobacco and guns!
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
     
     B&B leave the office, muttering.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes
               and chicks! We're gonna score!
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh huh huh.
     
     
     EXT.  AIRPORT NEAR B&B'S HOMETOWN - DAY
     
     A plane lands.
     
     
     INT.  PLANE/DOOR - DAY
     
     As before, the flight crew stares in horror and silence as B&B 
     deplane.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... bye-bye.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
     
     
     EXT.  ELITE MOTEL LODGE BAR - DAY
     
     Walking home, B&B pass the motel. They notice the sign for big 
     screen TV. They stop and look at it.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               You know what else sucks? We never even
               got a TV.
     
     ON BEAVIS, seeing something, amazed, ecstatic.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Heh mmm, hey mmm Butt-Head! Look!
     
     Heavenly MUSIC. B&B stare at the wonder before them.
     
     ANGLE ON THEIR TV, mangled, partly-crushed junk.
     
                         B&B
               Yes! Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
     
     B&B run up to the set like it was their lost and found dog.
     
     
     EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
     
     B&B walk off into the distance with the TV.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever
               gonna score?
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're
               too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
     
                         BEAVIS
               Shut up, dill-hole.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Butt-dumpling...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Turd-burglar...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Dill-wad...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Bunghole...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Butt-snatch...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... dill, um, face...
     
                         BEAVIS
               Um... ass... head...
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Uh... butt-snatch...
     
                         BEAVIS
               You already said that, Butt-Head.
     
                         BUTT-HEAD
               Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
     
                         B&B
               Huh huh huh...
     
     B&B head off into the sunset, trading lame insults as we FADE OUT.
     
                              END
