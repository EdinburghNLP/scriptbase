<b>1   BLACK SCREEN                                                   1
</b>
    TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic.

<b>                                                    FADE UP:
</b>

<b>2   EXT. THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK                       2
</b>
    The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
    their shows. Cabs line the streets.

<b>    SIDE ALLEY
</b>
    A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a
    screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
    rushes to the side entrance of a theater.

    In the background we see that the title of the play,
    "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...


<b>3   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK                       3
</b>
    We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through
    narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS
    dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make-
    up, etc...

<b>    TITLES CONTINUE.
</b>

<b>4   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE/EMPTY STAGE - DUSK           4
</b>
    The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the
    audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .

    Stagehands are moving stage lights as--

<b>    A STAGE MANAGER
</b>
    takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the
    audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella
    in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.

    He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief
    floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit
    hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly
    hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in
    the background.

    The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the
    audience dies down.


<b>                                                               1
</b>                                                     pg. 2


<b>5   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                5
</b>
    The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a
    single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see
    the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).

    "Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before:

<b>                              PROLOGUE
</b>                Soul of the Age!
                The applause, delight, the wonder of
                our stage!
                Our Shakespeare, rise...
                       (beat, repeating)
                Our Shakespeare... For he is all of
                ours, is he not? The most performed
                playwright of all time! The author of
                37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several
                epic poems that are collectively known
                as the ultimate expressions of
                humanity in the English language. And
                yet... And yet...
                       (beat)
                Not a single manuscript of any kind
                has ever been found written in
                Shakespeare's own hand. In four
                hundred years, not one document-- be
                it poem, play, diary or even a simple
                letter.
                       (beat)
                He was born the son of a glove-maker,
                and at some unknown time, armed with
                but an elementary school education, he
                went to London where, the story goes,
                he became an actor and eventually a
                playwright.

<b>    OFF STAGE
</b>
    A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a
    flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.

    Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a
    stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.

<b>    ON STAGE
</b>
    "Prologue" opens his umbrella.

<b>                             PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
</b>                He died at the age of 56, and was
                survived by his wife and two daughters
                who were, like Shakespeare's own
                father, irrefutably illiterate.

<b>                                                              2
</b>                                                 pg. 3


<b>OFF STAGE
</b>
In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to
<b>RAIN.
</b>
<b>                         PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>            His will famously left his second best
            bed to his widow. But it made no
            mention of a single book or
            manuscript.

The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears
in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a
prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of
Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.

<b>                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
</b>            Is it possible Shakespeare owned no
            books at his death because... he could
            not read? That he wrote no letters
            because he, like his father before him
            and his children after him, could not
            write?
                   (lets that sink in, then)
            Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost;
            his biography made not by history...
            but by conjecture. His story not
            written with facts, but with...
            imagination.

The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the
camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....

<b>                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
</b>                   (more energetic)
            So! Let me offer you a different
            story. A darker story... Of quills
            and swords. Of power and betrayal.
            Of a stage conquered, and a throne
            lost!

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of
RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then,
trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben
Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of
houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We
are:




<b>                                                          3
</b>                                                      pg. 4


<b>6    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT                             6
</b>
     Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
     toward a large circular theater.

     He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--


<b>7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7
</b>
     --and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and
     desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards
     the stage as--


<b>8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8
</b>
     About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They
     are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.

<b>                            POLE
</b>               Break it down!

     And several of the guards charge the door with their
     pikes, HITTING it hard.

<b>                            POLE (CONT'D)
</b>               Again!


<b>9    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            9
</b>
     Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view
     just as--


<b>10   EXT/INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                    10
</b>
     --the guards SMASH the door open.    Pole is the first
     in.

<b>                             POLE
</b>               Jonson!   Jonson!!    Show yourself!

     The soldiers immediately spread out into different
     parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--

<b>     JONSON
</b>
     has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
     trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
     props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,
     shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes
     when he sees--

<b>                                                               4
</b>                                                pg. 5


<b>THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS
</b>
--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole
amongst them.

<b>                          POLE (CONT'D)
</b>            Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke
            you out like a rat if we have to!
                   (beat)
            Jonson?! Jonson!!

Nothing.    A beat, then--

<b>                         POLE (CONT'D)
</b>                   (to a soldier)
            Torch it.

The soldier hesitates.

<b>                          POLE (CONT'D)
</b>            Torch it!   All of you!

The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the
galleries, the columns as--

<b>JONSON
</b>
GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.

He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place, then
closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--

<b>FLAMES
</b>
--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the
front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the
seating galleries... the columns...

<b>A TRAP DOOR
</b>
opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in
his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.

Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers!

Ballocks!

Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.

<b>11   EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                            11
</b>
     Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through
     the door, Pole following.

     A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the
     theater burn. The guards have to push their way
     through them.

<b>     INSERT
</b>
     The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's
     stage, and--

<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     -- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
     and see:

<b>     THE THEATER
</b>
     Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.


<b>12   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN                             12
</b>
     A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes
     its way towards the Tower Of London.


<b>13   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN      13
</b>
     Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side
     of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few
     torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far
     side of the room.

     An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him.   Dressed all in
     black, he is wispy thin.

<b>                            INTERROGATOR
</b>               You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright?
               Son of William Jonson, glass-blower,
               son of James Jonson brick-layer?

     Jonson nods.

<b>                            INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
</b>               And have you ever been arrested
               before, Mr. Jonson?

<b>                            JONSON
</b>               I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course
               I've bloody well been--

<b>                                                              6
</b>                                                     pg. 7


And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--
hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground.
His nose starts to bleed.

As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks
across the room-- there is someone else there, a
FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.

Jonson notices the figure as well.      We hear a voice
from the darkness.

<b>                          FIGURE
</b>             Ask him about the plays.

<b>                            JONSON
</b>                      (to the Interrogator)
             Plays?
                    (to the Figure)
             Which would you prefer, my lord? A
             pastoral? An historical? An
             historical-pastoral, or an hysterical
             historical pastoral--

And SMACK!    He's hit by the guards again.   He SPITS out
a tooth.

<b>                          INTERROGATOR
</b>             We are not interested in your plays,
             Jonson. We are interested in the
             plays given to you by Edward de Vere,
             Earl of Oxford.

Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the
darkness.

<b>                          JONSON
</b>             I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I

laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere
outside. Before we really understand what we are
seeing we are:

<b>BACK IN THE CELL
</b>
Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious.      His mouth is
ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.

<b>                                                              7

     The skin has broken on his forehead.     The Interrogator
     leans into the bloody Jonson.

<b>                               INTERROGATOR
</b>                  Where are the plays?

     Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK!

     walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the
     Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes
     have seen better days.

     His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON
     (22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and
     extremely enthusiastic.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          I promise you, Edward, you've seen
          nothing like it before! Nothing!

<b>                       OXFORD

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>                 (teasing)
          You're an elitist, you know that,

Oxford pauses at the entrance.

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          There won't be puppets, will there?

Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER,
who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay
outside) inside.

<b>                        USHER
</b>          My lords...


<b>INT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford
observes everything as they walk.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          The stage-craft is quite spectacular.
          Far more elaborate than anything I've
          seen at court. I've witnessed be-
          headings that god as my witness look
          as real as at the Tower, cannons fired
          in battle...

They come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has
a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much
like a match-stick girl.

<b>                        SELLING-MAID
</b>          Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord?

Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up
another flight of stairs.

<b>                        SOUTHAMPTON
</b>           ...and last week, they had some sort
           of a device to hoist cherubs into the
           air and fly over the entire audience!

</b>           An apò mekhanes theós. Deus ex
           machina. Machine of the Gods.

And as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches
glimpses of the stage and performance through the
rafters and over the heads of the attending audience.

<b>                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>           Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes
           into a situation from which they
           couldn't write their way out--

Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost
despite himself.

<b>                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>           --Out came the apò mekhanes theós...
           As when Hippolytus is saved by
           Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens...
           Always good for an apò mekhanes theós
           was Euripides

Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.

They come to the third floor and enter the box seating
area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real
look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and
sees-

<b>FROM OXFORD'S POV
</b>
Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids
SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...

It's alive.   Magical.

<b>BACK TO OXFORD
</b>
Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.

<b>ON-STAGE
</b>
The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner.
He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard
of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.

Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a
pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.

<b>                                                            10

He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage
is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays
"Sogliardo"

<b>                         SHAKESPEARE
</b>            And whither were you riding now,
            signior?

<b>                         "FASTIDIOUS"
</b>            Who, I? What a silly jest's that!
            Whither should I ride but to the
            court?

<b>                         SHAKESPEARE
</b>            O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more;
            your hot-house, your pig-house, or
            your whore-house!

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks
below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings".
He smiles seductively. She smiles back.

<b>BACKSTAGE
</b>
Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the
performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking
the lines with the actors.

<b>IN THE RAISED SEATING
</b>
A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an
air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE
(32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the
boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard
drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered
a bit of a hack by his colleagues.

They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they
frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.

<b>                         NASHE
</b>                   (takes a swig of ale)
            His second play, and almost a full
            house.
                   (burps)
            He's got a wit, does Jonson.

<b>                         MARLOWE
</b>            That might be so, but like a grain of
            wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you
            shall seek all day ere you find it,
            and when you have it, it's not worth
            the search!


<b>                                                             11
</b>                                                 pg. 12


The others smile as a WOMAN passes.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          Ale!   Ale!!

<b>                       DEKKER
</b>          Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will
          you? Henslowe still owes me for
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

<b>                       MARLOWE
</b>                 (retrieving coins)
          That would be because no one saw
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

<b>                         DEKKER
</b>          Ale here!

Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--

<b>                       NASHE
</b>          Kit... Isn't that one of your
          unrequited loves in the box over
          there?

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots
Southampton siting next to Oxford.

<b>                       MARLOWE
</b>                 (frowns)
          But with whom? Tell me not he prefers
          the company of such old grey men as
          that!

Nashe squints.

<b>                       NASHE
</b>          I think-- yes, by the beard, that's
          the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker
          used to play for him. Had his own
          acting troupe for private Court
          performances and the like.

<b>                       DEKKER
</b>          I wonder if he needs any material?

<b>                       MARLOWE
</b>          Certainly not any of yours.

<b>                       NASHE
</b>          No, no-- that was years ago. Had a
          falling out with the Queen, I heard.
          He's more of a recluse than a patron
          these days.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".

<b>                          SHAKESPEARE
</b>             Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a
             gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the
             earth; man, he looks like a fresh
             salmon kept in a tub!

Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place.
The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in
laughter.

<b>                          SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
</b>             He sleeps with a musk-cat every night,
             and walks all day hang'd in perfumed
             chains for penance.

<b>                           A GROUNDLING
</b>             Oi!   So that's what I been smelling!

More groundlings laugh.     Interestingly--

<b>NOBLEMEN
</b>
in the box seats do not.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to
the groundlings.

<b>                          SHAKESPEARE
</b>             He has his skin tann'd in civet, to
             make his complexion strong, and the
             sweetness of his youth lasting in the
             sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly,
             the poor man's brain is lighter than
             his feather...

As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:

<b>A NOBLEMAN
</b>
with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the
theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him
as he goes.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.



<b>                                                              13

<b>                         SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
</b>            He is a good and empty puff, but he
            loves you well, signior. I wish you
            well with him.

<b>OXFORD
</b>
Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass
by.

<b>BACKSTAGE
</b>
Later in the play...

Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig
from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his
performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson,
and grabs him.

<b>                        SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
</b>            Jonson! Wonderful dialogue!
            Wonderful. I hope your next--

<b>                          HENSLOWE (O.C.)
</b>            Will!   Will Shakespeare!

Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE
(50'S) heading his way.

<b>                         HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>            That's not ale in that goblet is it?

Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back.

<b>                         SHAKESPEARE
</b>            Ale? Me? Drink during a performance?
            I am a professional sir!
                   (burps)
            A complete and--

He is interrupted by SCREAMS.    Not from actors on
stage, but by the audience.

<b>IN THE THEATER
</b>
Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard
STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as
quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry
CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13).

theater.

     Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind
     him.

<b>18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18
</b>
     Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against
     Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will
     learn, very ambitious.

<b>                            ESSEX
</b>               ...and how do the Cecils spend their
               time and energy? Shutting a theater!
               A theater, for god's sake? It's
               madness! No wonder the mob hates them
               so!

     The court is inside, and slightly different from
     today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat
     like racquet-ball.

     Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot,
     but it goes--

<b>                              OXFORD
</b>               Out!

     Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton
     prepares to serve.

<b>                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>                      (to Southampton)

     Southampton pauses before serving.

<b>                           SOUTHAMPTON
</b>               Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand,
               maybe more.

     Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated
     rally begins.

<b>                            OXFORD
</b>               And how many performances are there of
               a play like that?

<b>                            SOUTHAMPTON
</b>               Five or six I suppose.

     He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it.

<b>                             ESSEX
</b>               By the--!

<b>                            OXFORD

               So! Ten thousand souls. All
               listening to the writings of one man--
               the ideas of one man. That's power,
               Robert. And if there is one thing the
               Cecils understand, it's power.

<b>                            ESSEX
</b>                      (snorts)
               And when did words ever win a kingdom?
               I think I'll keep my sword, thank you
               very much.

     Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naiveté.


<b>19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19
</b>
     Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis
     clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two
     valets.

<b>                            ESSEX
</b>                      (to the valets)
               Leave us.
                      (they exit)
               Henry... Some of my men have...
               intercepted... some of William Cecil's
               recent correspondence with King James
               of Scotland...



<b>                                                               17
</b>                                                 pg. 18


Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is
serious.

<b>                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>          Cecil's all but promising him the
          throne...

<b>                        SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          To James?   Elizabeth would never agree
          to-

<b>                       ESSEX
</b>          Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her
          old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even
          recognize me. And yet, still she
          refuses to name an heir.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?

<b>                       ESSEX
</b>          You are not in the Privy Council.
          Elizabeth does everything the Cecils
          wish of her. Everything!

<b>BEHIND THEM
</b>
Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He
instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He
listens as:

<b>WIDER
</b>
<b>                        ESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>          Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his
          throne, Cecil will have more influence
          in the next reign than he does in this
          one. And after William Cecil, his
          hunch-backed son will take his
          place...
                 (careful)
          That is why we must do everything in
          our power to ensure that the right man
          succeeds her.
                 (beat)
          A man deserving of the Tudor crown.

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.

<b>                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
</b>          I ask you for the support of you and
          your men, Henry.... if it comes to a
          fight.


<b>                                                          18

     Southampton looks at Essex hard.

<b>                             SOUTHAMPTON
</b>                You know you need not ask. I stand
                with you, as I always have.

     Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something
     shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

<b>     WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING
</b>
     Nothing.   He is gone.

<b>     BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX
</b>
     They exchange a slightly worried look.

     Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
     elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
     residence.

<b>                             OXFORD
</b>                Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?

     Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out
     to him, and touches his shoulder.

<b>                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>                       (warning)

     Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--

<b>                             SOUTHAMPTON
</b>                       (re: his discussion with

<b>                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
</b>                And what would you have me do?

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          I would have you deny him.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          The son of the Queen?

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          That is rumor only, Henry--

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
          look at Essex to see the Queen's
          reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
          son, everyone! And I for one would
          rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
          he may be, than a Scotsman!

<b>                        OXFORD
</b>          I desire nothing more than to see the
          next king be the rightful king. But
          what Essex contemplates will surely
          lead to Civil War.
                 (beat)
          No. If this is to be done, it must be
          done carefully, skillfully.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you
          from her presence for the last twenty
          years because of your "skill" at Court
          politics.

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that.

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          I only have your interests in mind,
          Henry. For as you so rightly point
          out, my interests are already lost.

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          I know. Forgive me. You know how I
          feel about you. You have been a great
          friend to me ever since my father
          died. I promise you that I will do
          nothing rash without consulting you
          first.

Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for
his horse.

<b>21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21
</b>
     The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
     house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in
     design.

     It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area
     which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
     the noblemen off for a week-end get away.


<b>22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22
</b>
     Most of England's nobility is assembled in small
     groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some
     music, no life. Quite Puritan.

     Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere
     to be seen.

<b>     A HUNCH-BACKED MAN
</b>
     --makes his way through the room, causing conversations
     to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the
     nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This
     is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).

     He pauses near Southampton.

<b>                              SOUTHAMPTON

               chamber with her majesty...

</b>                        (sharp, annoyed)
               Alone?




<b>                                                               21

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON

          With your father in London dealing
          with all the troubles in Ireland, who
          else should the Queen turn to but
          Essex?

Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the
SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.

A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--

<b>                       FOOTMAN
</b>          By the grace of god, her majesty,
          Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and
          Ireland!

<b>DOUBLE DOORS
</b>
open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar.

She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like
she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being
all the more regal, all the more un-human.

Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet.

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

<b>                       ESSEX
</b>                 (to Elizabeth)
          Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord
          of Southampton has a gift for you.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>                 (eyes sparkle)
          A gift?

<b>                       SOUTHAMPTON
</b>          Yes, your grace, though not from me.

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room
<b>OPENS.
</b>
A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors
swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.


<b>                                                           22

Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a
smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          Are you this gift, my precious little
          man?

<b>                       DWARF
</b>          No, no, my most majestic majesty. I
          am a free man. My gift is a play,
          majesty.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          A play?

The dwarf bows his assent.

<b>                       ROBERT CECIL

          Plays are the work of the devil, born

          thievery, fornication, and heresy.

Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked.

<b>                       ESSEX (CONT'D)

          Of course that is if you so desire,

                 (to Robert Cecil)
          The choice is her majesty's to make,
          not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert?

Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the
political tides around her. Then--

<b>                       ELIZABETH

               Oh, but I do so admire his verse...

     Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the
     Dwarf, who smiles brightly.

     And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex
     follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him.
     They exchange a knowing look as--

     Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not
     happy with this turn of events as we hear--

     Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the
     ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"
     surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.

     Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the
     grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of
     course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a
     young woman. Essex is next to her.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a
commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the
fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck
hides behind a tree watching.

</b>            I will walk up and down here, and I
            will sing, that they shall hear I am
            not afraid.

<b>BACKSTAGE
</b>
Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully
observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him.

<b>                         "BOTTOM" (CONT'D)

            With orange-tawny bill,
            The throstle with his note so true,
            The wren with little quill--

Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur.

</b>            What angel wakes me from my flow'ry

<b>ELIZABETH
</b>
strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some
memory in her. A pleasant memory.

<b>OXFORD
</b>
watches, delighted by her reaction.

<b>FROM HIS POV
</b>
We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from
the same play. We are:


<b>                                                            25

</b>
     Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches
     an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A
     Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a
     bit more thrown together).

     All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.

<b>     FROM BACKSTAGE
</b>
     A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw
     Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old.
     But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the
     character of "Puck".

<b>                             "OBERON" (O.S.)
</b>                ...and the owner of it blest ever
                shall in safety rest. Trip away; make
                no stay;
                meet me all by break of day.

     And the characters of "Oberon" and "Titania" exit.     Boy
     Oxford hurries--

<b>     ON STAGE
</b>
<b>                             "PUCK"
</b>                If we shadows have offended, think but
                this, and all is mended, that you have
                but slumber'd here while these visions
                did appear...

     Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father,
     also watches, his face beaming with pride.

<b>                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)

                mend.

<b>     A STERN LOOKING MAN
</b>
     is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He
     is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a
     Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace
     collar), and has a long   beard. He is frowning,
     loathing the play.

     her.

     are removing their costumes and make-up, including Boy
     Oxford, who sits in front of a make-shift, leaning
     mirror.

     Much excited talking and commotion, until Boy Oxford
     notices everyone has gone silent. He turns-- his winged

     Young Elizabeth and her senior Court, including William

She thinks.   Then--

     William Cecil stiffens in discomfort.

               Our Lord Cecil is our most religious
               of subjects, and no doubt thinks your
               little masque will deliver your soul
               straight into the arms of Lucifer
               himself. Don't you, William?

     The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by
     such a thing.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               That is God's decision, your majesty.

     William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting
     in an uncomfortable silence.

     Elizabeth notices.

<b>                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
</b>               Well, if plays are indeed such a sin,
               I pray I do not find my salvation

      Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time
      in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
      Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
      of arms on its chest.

      The City of London is far in the distance.

      Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
      for a moment before--

<b>                                JONSON

</b>                   And where are we going?

      Francesco is silent.

<b>      WIDER

      Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he
      turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards

      Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
      Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one
      of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).

      Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
      place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.

<b>                       JONSON

</b>          That is true. And it was quite hard
          to come by. One does not cross my
          father-in-law lightly.

Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.

<b>                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          Lord William Cecil. I have the
          questionable distinction of being

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow.

<b>                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          It did, however, serve as helpful when
          I wrote to your jailers to release you

to Anne.

</b>                 (in a panicked whisper)
          My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my

          But you are free, are you not?

They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne
watches them as they disappear into the maze.

</b>               But it's politics did seem to have
               quite an effect on the Tower. My
               father-in-law's men felt it quite
               seditious.

<b>                            JONSON
</b>               Politics? My play had nothing to do
               with politics! It was just a simple
               comedy--

<b>                             OXFORD

               All art is political, Jonson.

               And all artists have something to say,
               otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
               you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

     As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to
     his servant.

               Francesco.

     Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
     bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and
     opens it.

<b>                            JONSON

</b>          My name, my lord?

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          I can't very well use my name, can I?
          I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford.
          The Lord Great Chamberlain of England,
          Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales,
          Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc.
          No. I have a... reputation to
          protect. In my world, one does not
          write plays, Jonson. People like you
          do.

Jonson tries not to be offended.

<b>                       JONSON
</b>          Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire
          play, my lord. I know how difficult--

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.
          No doubt, many more than you yourself.
          A good number performed at Court years
          ago, others never seen by a living
          soul.

<b>                       JONSON
</b>          And you want... me to apply my name to
          this play?

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          No. I mean you to put your name to
          all of them.

<b>                         JONSON
</b>          All of them?

<b>                       OXFORD
</b>          Well don't look like I just gutted
          your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make
          you the most popular-- and therefore
          the most monetarily successful--
          playwright in all of London.

Jonson pales.   This is a disaster for him.

<b>                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          I wish you god speed and good morrow.

Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.

</b>               My lord-- I really--

     He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze
     without so much as a good-bye.

<b>                              JONSON (CONT'D)
</b>               My lord?

     But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather
     pouch of coins at his feet.

<b>                            FRANCESCO
</b>               That is for your trouble, Signor
               Jonson. And your silence. If I hear
               you break that silence, then... not so
               good for Signor Jonson.

     And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
     up the pouch, examining its contents.

     And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out
     of the maze. He chases after them.

<b>                             JONSON
</b>               Hello?   My lord?! I--

     And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks
     a path (the wrong one).

     Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river   entrance
     to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge   docking.
     William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the   barge,
     waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an    ornately
     carved white cane.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               So! I am gone for three days, and you

               them solely in the company of the Earl
               of Essex...

     Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.

</b>               Don't think because I was in London, I

               unwell, she is reading, she is seeing
               the Ambassador from Russia. For God's
               sake, use your imagination, Robert.
               Whatever will you do when I am gone?
                      (beat)
               We will have to deal with Essex soon.
               His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.


<b>30   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           30

     William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to
     his son.


<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               Now tell me about the play.

     Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he
     knows about that as well.

<b>                            ROBERT CECIL
</b>               It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex
               insisted it be performed, just to
               spite me in front of Court...

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               Of course he did.
                      (concerned)
               But what was it about?

<b>                            ROBERT CECIL
</b>               About? Some nonsense about fairies
               and cherubs.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               ...And dancing asses?

     Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped
     suddenly.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>                      (realizing, to himself)

     And he starts back up the stairs.

<b>                              ROBERT CECIL
</b>               Father...    It was just a play...

<b>                             WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               And do you know how long it took me to
               banish them from her presence? She
               adores them! Adores them! And Edward
               knows it.

               Mark my words, Robert, he has done
               this for a purpose.

<b>                              ROBERT CECIL
</b>               Purpose?    What purpose?

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>                      (thinking, to himself)
               What purpose indeed?
                      (to Robert)
               But through your carelessness I must
               now deal not only with Essex, but
               Edward as well. For whether in shadow
               or in person, Edward has returned to
               Court!

     And with that he slams the door shut.

     Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window. Visibly
     upset he starts to stare out of the window and
     remembers...

     And it is thirty years earlier.

     BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window.
     His back must have been deformed either in utero or at
     birth, because even now he is hunchbacked.

</b>                 (more commanding)
          Robert! Come here.

Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford
(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and
his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of
them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are
<b>TUTORS.
</b>
Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move.

          I am sorry, my lord. But my son

Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his
mother and sister.

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>          May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and

Young Anne curtsies.

</b>          I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
          The realm lost a great lord with your

finally come over.

     Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good.
     In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his
     age.

     Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess
     against himself.

     Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed
     attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES
     into the air, and hits--

<b>     THE CHESS BOARD
</b>
     making the pieces scatter.

<b>     WIDER

     Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see
     Young Oxford coming over to him.

     Young Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his
     tutor, who catches it.

     Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black
     king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't
     catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the
     floor.

     Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall
     alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his
     hand.

     And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly
     stuffing them into a bag.

     But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks
     for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--
     he runs to it-- the door is locked!

     So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens,
     and Young Oxford enters.

     After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss.
     Looks at his--

     where the parchments are scattered.

<b>     YOUNG OXFORD
</b>
     goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of
     parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes
     through some other pages. And realizes other pages are
     missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--

<b>     UNDER THE TAPESTRY
</b>
     Two feet.




<b>                                                               40

<b>     WIDER
</b>
     Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand.     He
     THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.

     The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just
     die, but screams and screams and screams.

     Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in
     triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:


<b>36   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY                      36
</b>
     Thirty-three years later.

     Shakespeare is on stage, taking a bow. The audience is
     APPLAUDING and SCREAMING their approval of a
     performance that has just ended. He steps backwards--

<b>     BACKSTAGE
</b>
     --where Jonson stands holding the manuscript Oxford
     gave him.

<b>                              SHAKESPEARE
</b>                 Is it any good?

<b>                              JONSON
</b>                 How in blazes should I know?

<b>                              SHAKESPEARE
</b>                 You haven't even read it?

     And Shakespeare is drawn back--

<b>     ON STAGE
</b>
     --where he bows again, then steps--

<b>     BACKSTAGE
</b>
     --so Jonson can answer him.

<b>                              JONSON
</b>                 I read a line or two-- I promised
                 Henslowe I'd finish "Eastward Ho" by
                 Saturday.

<b>                              SHAKESPEARE
</b>                 And you say he's a nobleman?

     Jonson doesn't answer.


<b>                                                                 41

<b>                             SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
</b>               Powerful?   Rich??

     Jonson still doesn't answer, which is answer enough.

<b>                            SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
</b>               Ohhhh, you have to do it then, don't
               you?

     And Shakespeare goes back on stage.


<b>37   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                  37
</b>
     Jonson and Shakespeare are walking along Bankside,
     still mid-conversation. They pass all sorts of vendors
     selling fish, fresh water, food, etc...

<b>                            JONSON
</b>               I tell you Will-- I came to London to
               become a great poet, to, to, be the
               conscience of our times, the soul of
               our age! To change the world, not to
               become someone else's--

<b>                            SHAKESPEARE
</b>                      (amused)
               Change the world? With rhyme?

<b>                            JONSON
</b>               Yes, why not? Why can't a man change
               the world with words?

     Shakespeare laughs at him.

<b>                            JONSON (CONT'D)
</b>                      (mimicking Oxford)
               "I can make you the most popular and
               the richest playwright in all of
               London."

               Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank
               you very much.

     Shakespeare is perusing the manuscript.   Some of the
     actors from the Rose are in the BG.

<b>                            SHAKESPEARE
</b>               You know, it's actually not half
               bad...

     Jonson takes a swig of ale, then--

<b>                              JONSON
</b>                 Not half--?! You're an actor, what in

                 He's an amateur, Will, a complete and
                 utter amateur. Last week gardening,
                 this week playwrighting, next week
                 hawking.
                        (takes another swig)
                 No. I won't do it. It would be an
                 affront against the Muses...

<b>                              SHAKESPEARE
</b>                        (smiles)
                 Well we musn't offend the muses,
                 whatever we do.
                        (thinks, then)
                 How much money did you say he gave
                 you?

<b>                              JONSON
</b>                 What, you think my name can be bought,

     Shakespeare smiles enigmatically.

<b>                              SHAKESPEARE
</b>                 No, not at all... I think we should

</b>
     Elizabeth is behind an elaborately painted screen.
     Several ladies-in-waiting attend her, helping her get
     ready for the day. It's an intricate process. Make-
     up, multiple articles of clothing, jewelry...

<b>                              WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)

<b>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN (THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE
</b><b>OF SCREEN AS NEEDED)
</b>
William Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has
sneaked in the room behind him to listen in.

<b>                        WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          There are rumors of his sending
          financial aid, and even troops. We
          must act quickly.
                 (beat)
          We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of
          Ireland, and send additional troops
          immediately, majesty.

<b>                        ELIZABETH
</b>          Replace?   With whom?

William Cecil hesitates slightly, then--

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          I would recommend the Earl of Essex,
          your majesty.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          Essex?  To Ireland?

</b>          As long as the present crisis
          warrants, majesty.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          Impossible. He cannot be spared. We
          feel his counsel is of greater import
          with each passing day.

Not what William Cecil wanted to hear.

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          I only recommend we send your most
          able subjects where they are most

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          Essex's martial abilities are, in my
          opinion, the only antidote to the
          plague of Philip.
                 (clears his throat)
          Though, Essex would not,
          unfortunately, be able to remain in
          the Privy Council if he is in
          Ireland...

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          And who would you advise to replace
          him?

Three ladies-in-waiting approach with three different
gown. Elizabeth studies them as:

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          Sir Robert Cecil.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          Your son?

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          He is my own advisor first, my son
          second, majesty. His counsel has been
          invaluable to me, and no doubt will be
          to you as well.

Elizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the
handmaidens away.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>          Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to
          Ireland and place Robert on my Privy
          Council.

But William's flash of victory is dampened by--

<b>                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          I saw a play this last weekend,
          William. It made me think of... days
          long past. Of memories... long past.
          Long past. I should like to see more

     disgust.

join them.

Before Jonson can answer--

<b>ON STAGE

An actor, CONDELL (40's), dressed all in white (even
his face is painted white) enters stage. He is
"Prologue". He addresses the audience directly.

<b>                        "PROLOGUE"
</b>           Oh, for a muse of fire, that would
           ascend the brightest heaven of
           invention. A kingdom for a stage,
           princes to act, and monarchs to behold
           the swelling scene! Then should
           warlike Harry, like himself, assume
           the port of Mars, and at his heels
           should famine, sword, and fire crouch
           for his employment. Can this cockpit
           hold the vasty fields of France?

          surging ambitions of a courtier, the
          foul designs of a murderer, the

     Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge--
     the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it
     is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost
     like a mall.

     Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of
     "Romeo and Juliet"

<b>                            SHAKESPEARE

               It's really not that difficult, if you

<b>                            SHAKESPEARE
</b>               And have you ever tried?

     Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some
     onions from a stand.

     Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples
     at the next stand.

          "But soft, what light through yonder

Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street.
Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling
smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after
Jonson.

     A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen

     played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet".

Young Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish

<b>YOUNG ELIZABETH

seems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She
STARES intently back at Young Oxford.

<b>WIDER

There is a natural change in the music, and all the
dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance.
Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish
Ambassador goes to Anne.

<b>YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD

stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate
moves.

<b>                       YOUNG ELIZABETH

          ear...

<b>WIDER

Much of the Court is watching this.   They can tell
there are sparks between them.

All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth
and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again
finds himself with Elizabeth.

<b>                       YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

out.

Young Oxford glances over at--

<b>YOUNG ANNE

who is now dancing with the Spanish Ambassador. But
she watches Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford with a
great deal of jealousy.

Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he
sees any more than Young Anne does.

Still dancing.

<b>                          YOUNG OXFORD
</b>             If she is, it is but a small comfort
             to me. I am returned only under my
             father-in-law's insistence.

A beat as this sinks in.

</b>
     Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc...

     outside the Rose, announcing each play's title.      At
     first, Shakespeare's name is small, with each
     succeeding play his name gets bigger. And--

<b>     AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE
</b>
     Shakespeare bows to the ever-increasing applause of his
     audience. He looks up to see the Mermaid's Wits all
     watching him with stony silence.

     And as each play is seen, Jonson and the rest of the
     Wits seem more and more depressed.

     And after each performance, Shakespeare seems to be
     greeted with more and more adulation.

     Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front
     of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk.

     William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill,
     and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels
     attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan
     wheelchair.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               No, Robert, think. If he is really as
               popular as you say, we would only
               anger the mob. No. We must strike at
               Edward directly.

     William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from
     his chair as--

<b>                            ROBERT CECIL
</b>               But we cannot maintain our authority
               if the mob thinks us laughing stocks--

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>                      (angry)
               Our authority comes from Elizabeth and
               from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is
               the key to all.

     desk-- a spring loaded secret drawer POPS open. Robert
     Cecil has never seen it before.

     drawer, offers it to Robert Cecil.

      A beat as this registers on Robert Cecil.

     Robert Cecil looks surprised.

<b>                             WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>               This is how kings are made, Robert.
               So it was with Elizabeth, and so it
               shall ever be. There were many rival
               claims to her throne, but none
               survived to make their claim. James
               must know that you will do the same
               for him, and he will reward you for
               it.
                      (beat)
               But we must do one thing more...

     William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass
     vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>               Like Essex, Edward must be removed.

</b>                      (confused)
               Edward?

     William Cecil is slowly falling asleep...

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               He uses the tools at his disposal, as
               we use the tools at ours. But ours
               will win... as they always have.

Young Elizabeth turns to Bessie.

William Cecil thinks.

William Cecil looks startled.

          married.

<b>                        WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          Can you?

She gives him a sharp look.

<b>                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>          Most of the Catholic princes of Europe

          the hope that they might marry you,
          and thereby achieve your realm through
          other means.

Young Elizabeth hears him, thinks on it, then begins
pacing again.

     senses he is not alone. He turns and sees Young Oxford
     (still 20).

               chambers three times, and she will not
               receive me. And now she's gone!

     William Cecil regards Young Oxford for a beat, then
     stands.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL

               last, of her lovers.

     Young Oxford looks up at him like a bucket of cold
     water has hit him.

     Twenty-seven years later. Jonson is alone, trying to
     write at a small table, though it's obvious from his
     fits and starts and crossing outs that he is having
     difficulty.

<b>                            MARLOWE (O.S.)

               After watching something like
               "Hamlet"...

     Jonson looks up. Marlowe sits, uninvited.    Jonson
     looks annoyed at the interruption.

<b>                            MARLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>               I've seen you watch him. Will.

Jonson stares at him, his answer obvious.

<b>                       MARLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>          Why do you think Will hasn't been
          arrested? You or I make the slightest
          joke about a nobleman of no
          consequence, and we find ourselves in
          a cell quicker than a fart spreads in
          the trade winds. Will-- he murders a
          caricature of old William Cecil
          himself, and still whores all the way
          to Westminster and back.

<b>                       JONSON

Jonson gets up and walks towards the door.

<b>                       MARLOWE
</b>          I made sure they did...

Jonson turns around.

<b>                       JONSON

<b>                       MARLOWE
</b>          Watch who you judge, Ben, for as God
          is my witness, you may well find
          yourself doing the same before you
          meet your maker. We do what we have
          to, to survive, and survive well, in
          this life. All of us. And Will is
          definitely not one of us. You know
          he's illiterate, don't you?

Jonson is stunned.

<b>                       MARLOWE (CONT'D)
</b>          No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how
          else could he learn his lines? But

</b>                You reported on me as well, didn't
                you, Kit? Last year. That's why I
                was arrested, wasn't it? Because you

     Essex is having a Council of War with his generals and

     around a table, consulting a map of Ireland.

               Castle...

     The SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine
     into various goblets. Southampton notices him-- the
     servant's hand shakes as he pours the wine.

     Southampton notices the Servant's shaking hand slipping
     into a pocket as--

</b>               Bien.    En garde!

     And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly
     surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more
     aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but
     is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.

     And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS
     Oxford in the leg.

<b>                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>               Qu'est ce que vous faites?

     But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu
     continues his attack.

     This has become an assassination attempt, not an
     exercise.

<b>     ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE
</b>
     Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
     carrying a pitcher and two goblets.

<b>     CENTER OF THE MAZE
</b>
     Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he
     begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
     Beaulieu.

<b>     IN THE MAZE
</b>
     Francesco heads for the center as--

<b>     IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE
</b>
     Oxford PIERCES Beaulieu's heart with his rapier, and
     Beaulieu SCREAMS--

<b>     IN THE MAZE
</b>
     Francesco hears the scream, and starts to run.

<b>                              FRANCESCO
</b>               Signor?    Signor?!

</b>               Signor? Mio dio! Signor! What has
               happened--

     Oxford checks his leg wound, and glances at the dead
     Beaulieu. He tries to wave off Franceso's aid, but to
     no avail as--

<b>                            OXFORD
</b>               Beaulieu-- he, he tried to kill me...

     on its back in the alley. Someone turns it over.    It's
     MARLOWE, a dried stab-wound in his eye.

     A small, open air theater where a chained bear is being
     led around the theater. A set of mastiffs are being
     led on the opposite side of the theater.

     The spectators are unruly, loudly making bets for the
     mauling to come.

     Jonson is among them, taking a look at the bear, deciding
     whether to bet on it or not.

<b>                            BEAR BAITER

Jonson suddenly turns to him.

Shakespeare gives him a look to kill.

<b>                          SHAKESPEARE
</b>             This isn't a request, Ben.   I'll have

<b>                          MAN

Shakespeare shows no reaction.

</b>             I know he went to see you last night,
             Will. And I know he was planning to

             terms.

The bear baiting begins.

Shakespeare stares at Jonson.

</b>                    (dead serious)
             You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend.

<b>                          JONSON
</b>             Be careful, Will. You kill me off
             too, and you won't have any good plays

Some of the spectators BOO while others CHEER, and--

</b>             I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or
             another, I'll have my guineas.

start to go for the bear's throat.     Thge cheering goes to
a roar as we--

      Wears a beard and fake nose. He tries to stay hidden so
      Jonson doesn't see him. We are:

</b>
      Jonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and
      drinks an ale.

      Then Oxford's servant, Francesco, appears.

      After the two men have exchanged couple of words,
      Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a
      manuscript and a purse jingling with coin. Jonson
      takes them and leaves.

      Jonson safely gone, Shakespeare starts to follow
      Francesco who heads back over the bridge.

      Shakespeare is waiting, clearly uncomfortable. It's
      not the kind of room he's used to being in. He holds
      his wig and his nose.

      A door opens, and Oxford enters, walking on a stick
      because of his leg injury. He is followed by his
      servant, Francesco.

Shakespeare is uncomfortable. He wasn't expecting
Oxford himself. Then he just goes for it.

<b>                       SHAKESPEARE

</b>          I am addressing the writer of

          I not?

Oxford is silent. Francesco goes to physically eject
Shakespeare from the room.

<b>                      FRANCESCO
</b>          Out. Get out! How dare you insult my

          How much?

Shakespeare looks at Francesco, then Oxford.

<b>                       SHAKESPEARE
</b>          Four hundred pounds. A year.

      She is crushed.

</b>                Majesty, there is more. The lady is
                pregnant.

      Young Elizabeth freezes, stunned.   Then--

</b>                Arrest them.    Arrest them both!

      William Cecil bows and exits.

      Now alone, Young Elizabeth lets her emotions out.   She
      picks up a vase and THROWS it into a wall.

      From high above, we see a carriage arrive.    It stops,
      and William Cecil gets out.

      Young Oxford (now 26) is looking out a window at the
      river beyond. He has been imprisoned for some months.
      His beard has become ragged, his clothes have seen
      better days.

      William Cecil enters.

<b>                             WILLIAM CECIL
</b>                Your whore gave birth last week.

      Young Oxford turns to William Cecil. The stare at each
      other for a beat.

</b>          The Queen has decided to release you.
          It seems time does indeed heal all
          wounds.
                 (beat)
          These are her conditions for your
          release. One. You will not
          acknowledge the child. Two. You will
          never see the mother again. Three.
          You will avoid Court at all costs.
          Her majesty would prefer not to be
          reminded of you in any way ever again.

A beat as Young Oxford thinks on all this.

<b>                         YOUNG OXFORD
</b>          Banished...?

<b>                        WILLIAM CECIL
</b>          No. You have the freedom of the
          kingdom. Just not of the Court.
                 (beat)
          Those are her terms. Here are mine.
          You will go back to my daughter. You
          will make some effort to make her
          happy and you will finally act
          according to your station in life, and
          accept the responsibilities of your
          great title.

Oxford reluctantly NODS.    William Cecil goes to leave.

<b>                          YOUNG OXFORD
</b>          My lord!     I, too, have a condition.

William Cecil turns.

</b>          I will go back to your daughter if...
          You tell me the name of the child.

          delivered the--

</b>               Or I can remain here...

     William Cecil decides.

<b>                            WILLIAM CECIL
</b>               There is no record of his true birth,

               void, and I'll see your head on the

     Young Oxford (cleaned up) is watching a BOY about five
     years old dueling with a tutor. The boy is quite good.

     The boy notices Young Oxford, and stops duelling.

     Twenty-five years later. William Cecil's body is in
     state, in his coffin, in the center of the apse.

<b>     ELIZABETH
</b>
     looking completely stricken, approaches the coffin,
     holding Cecil's white cane. She places it at his side.

     In the background we hear the Archbishop of Canterbury
     reading from the bible.

     scans the room, to see how it is all playing out.

     watches stoically, his wife and children at his side.

     The funeral over, Elizabeth exits the portal of
     Westminster Abbey and heads to her carriage. A huge
     crowd of mourners has assembled.

     Robert Cecil steps into place right behind her.

<b>                            ELIZABETH
</b>               We wish to recall Essex from

     Robert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well.
     They continue to walk.

     her carriage, unsure of herself.

     off.

     As soon as it is away, Robert Cecil turns and some in
     the crowd of commoners begin to BOO at him.

     behind them, terrified of the intrusion, trying to stop
     them. They open the doors into--

     wearing her undergarments. She looks quite ugly.

     She turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion.

     Essex FREEZES.   He knows he has just made an enormous
     faux-pas.

      It looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army
      encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all
      tense.

      Oxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the
      courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men,
      their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands.

      follows, his concern for Oxford's wound noticeable.

      Oxford, Southampton and Essex are alone. Oxford is
      sitting in a chair, while Essex paces impatiently,
      Southampton standing between them.

</b>                I won't send her a letter.   I will
                send her a book.

      Essex looks confused, but Oxford ignores it.

       Oxford is in his rooms, writing feverishly by
       candlelight.

       He completes a thought... closes the manuscript...
       writes down the title with a flourish:

       The Tragedie of Richard III


<b>104    INT. A ROOM ABOVE THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - DAY                 104
</b>
       A room for the whores to take their tricks.    Small,
       with nothing much beyond a straw bed.

       Shakespeare is bedding a buxom young lady.

       And then the door OPENS. Francesco enters, and Oxford
       follows, holding a manuscript. Shakespeare looks
       shocked. She starts to SCREAM and yell as she pulls a
       sheet to cover herself.

<b>                              FRANCESCO
</b>                        (to the whore)
                 Hold your tongue, whore, and get out!

       She does so as Oxford walks over to Shakespeare. He
       tosses the manuscript to him. Shakespeare starts to
       look at it. The whore is partially dressed, so--

<b>                              FRANCESCO (CONT'D)

      Shakespeare gives a look to Oxford-- he certainly isn't
      going to pay for it.

      Oxford nods to Francesco, who gives the whore a few
      coins. She smiles, and leaves.

<b>                             OXFORD

                performed until I tell you. And you
                may only have a day's notice.

      Shakespeare looks confused.

      Oxford tosses a very large pouch of coins at him, and
      then begins to leave.

          beauty. That love. How I... took
          him. How I... adored him...

Robert Cecil knows to be silent.   She looks out the
window.

<b>                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Graze on my lips; and if those hills
          be dry,

She smiles seductively, transported in time.

<b>                        ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

she regains composure.

Robert Cecil hesitates.

She seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex.
But then she smiles, and NODS in approval.

</b>          Majesty... You are not having doubts
          about James of Scotland succeeding

Elizabeth goes into a rage.

          plotted and schemed to steal the
          throne from under me! No son of hers
          will rule while a yet Tudor lives!

Robert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his
head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself.

She says no more, the audience over. Robert Cecil
hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and
exits, the fury on his face plain.

Elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window...

       Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He
       stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater.
       Workers are still painting the walls.

       He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a
       performance of "Richard III" on Monday next.


<b>110A   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                              110A
</b>
       Jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new
       theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built.

       The actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character
       of "Gloucester". He walks on stage with a limp, and
       has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of
       Robert Cecil.

                 tricks, nor made to court an amorous
                 looking-glass...

       Richard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is
       watching his performance with Spencer and a group of
       actors.

       Jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat.

And "Gloucester" heads backstage.

<b>                       JONSON
</b>                 (to Burbage)
          Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful!
          The best Bankside! But only one
          performance? Is it that bad?

<b>                       BURBAGE
</b>          Hardly, it's Will's new play. Richard
          the Third. We've been hired to
          perform it free to the public.

<b>                         JONSON
</b>          Free?

<b>                       BURBAGE
</b>          Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for
          everything. God knows Will never
          would.   Been rehearsing all week,
          just found out this morning, we go up
          next Monday.

Jonson thinks a beat-- that's odd-- but then holds up
his manuscript.

<b>                       JONSON
</b>                 (grins)
          My best so far. I guarantee more than
          one performance. Though I'll not pay

          No need to.

<b>                       BURBAGE
</b>          Sorry, Ben...

Jonson looks confused.

      Jonson is deep in drink, by himself.   He listens as
      patrons of the bar say:

      Some of the actors from the rehearsal enter, all jolly
      and excited. They head for the bar. They are: The
      ACTOR WHO PLAYED "GLOUCESTER", Spencer, Pope, Heminge,
      etc...

      Jonson gets up, furious, and exits, quite drunk.     The

</b>
      The audience HUSHES as--

<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      "GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is
      hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as
      possible in terms of beard and costume. First the
      people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the
      hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the
      first boos.

      The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around...

<b>      IN THE GALLERIES
</b>
      Dekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil.

      Jonson gives Dekker a sharp look.   What's going on here?

      "Gloucester" addresses the audience.

      The hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the
      actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage
      again to continue.

      Jonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and
      spots--

</b>
      in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in
      Oxford's usual box seat.

                  pleasing of a lute. But I, that am
                  not shaped for sportive tricks, nor

       Elizabeth heads for the window just as a door behind
       her SLAMS open, and Robert Cecil hurries in with a
       dozen guards.

<b>                              ROBERT CECIL
</b>                 Majesty! You must away! Essex is in

                for himself!

      It takes only an instant for that to sink in. She
      looks enraged. And then she turns with a flurry, and
      heads back the way she came. The guards that were with
      Robert Cecil follow her.

      Another fusillade is SHOT, and more of Essex's men go
      down.

      And then doors OPEN on the ground floor, and guards
      RUSH out to take down the survivors.

      Essex and Southampton valiantly fight, but there's just
      too many.

      They're soon surrounded... And Essex, knowing all is
      lost, raises his sword in defeat.

      Southampton sees this, and does the same.

Oxford now looks confused.

<b>                       ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>          Elizabeth had several children,
          Edward, not just yours. She was
          sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary
          was still Queen, and our future
          Gloriana was out of favor. No one
          thought her very important at all.
          Except my father, of course. And when
          her first child was born, a male, my
          father took it, and hid it. The
          grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling
          of course had to be reared a nobleman.
          John De Vere, the previous Earl of
          Oxford, agreed to accept the task.

Oxford goes ashen.

          Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir.
          His own grandchild to follow you on
          the throne. But he couldn't possibly
          predict what kind of failure you would
          become. How you would fail in

       It's raining, hard.

       Oxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now
       empty courtyard. The remains of the battle are still
       visible. Wounded, screaming horses struggle to
       stand...

       Oxford's a shell-- devoid of emotion. Broken. Hardly
       alive at all. He drops to his knees, the rain pouring
       down on him.

       We see the silhouette of a man watching through a
       window from the second story above. It's--

       Pole approaches him from behind. Robert Cecil doesn't
       turn or acknowledge Pole, but speaks to him as he
       stares at Oxford.

      witnesses, as befitting Essex's rank.

      Doors fly open and Oxford appears before Elizabeth, who
      is on her throne, regal and all in white, surrounded
      by courtiers, including Robert Cecil. But she looks
      very old, very ill.

      Everyone goes silent as Oxford approaches Elizabeth.
      Oxford makes no notice of them. He bows deeply in

      Jonson is completely drunk, waving a sword in one hand,
      a tankard in another.

      dodges the drunk Jonson. Jonson ROARS and attacks

      Shakespeare dodges again, turns, and manages to grab
      Jonson by the throat. They are face to face.

      He furiously writes on a small tablet on his lap. He
      holds up his hand for silence as Jonson enters, the
      doctor following behind him.

He points to a chair by the bed. When Jonson sits down
he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the
bed.

<b>                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          Did you know, Jonson, that my family
          can trace its peerage farther back
          than any family in the kingdom?   We
          fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field.
          At Agincourt.

          wealthiest men ever to breathe English

Jonson looks on sadly.

<b>                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          Never a voice in government. Never a
          sword raised in glorious battle. No

To answer is not an easy task for Jonson's ego.    He
hesitates.

      consciousness and looks around. Somewhat confused he
      sees:

      Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him.
      Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear,

          man alive who has reason to hate him
          more than I?

Jonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking
about Cecil as well as himself.

<b>                       JONSON (CONT'D)
</b>          He was something I could never be. An
          undeniable perfection... that plagued
          my soul... And to him I was...
          nothing. A messenger. Nothing more.

Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching
for the truth. Then he smiles.

<b>                        CECIL
</b>          Let him go!   He tells the truth.

Robert Cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last
time.

<b>                       CECIL (CONT'D)
</b>          And Jonson-- better him, won't you?
          Wipe his memory for all time. For
          you. And for me.

Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at
him. Finally:

<b>                       JONSON
</b>                 (sotto)
          I am afraid that this is not possible,
          my lord.

Robert Cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.

<b>163    EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN               163

       Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely
       figure.

       Wide from above...Still smoking from the fire....All
       the sudden we make out Jonson searching through the
       rubble.


<b>164A   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT            164A
</b>
       Set for a Court performance of a play. Courtiers bow
       as King James I enters the chamber, Robert Cecil two
       steps behind him. James takes his seat right in front
       of the stage, as Elizabeth used to.

       Jonson's eyes search the ground.   And, eventually, he
       finds it--

<b>       THE METAL BOX
</b>
       that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.

<b>       JONSON
</b>
       opens the box.

<b>       INSIDE THE BOX
</b>
       Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles,
       relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are
       there. We hear--

<b>                               PROLOGUE (O.S.)
</b>                  O-- for a muse of fire... that would
                  ascend the brightest heaven of
                  invention...

<b>       AN ACTOR
</b>
       playing Prologue. He is the same actor who introduced
       the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he
       wears Elizabethan clothing-- but again, all
       monochromatic and grey.


<b>                                                                   140

                and monarchs to behold the swelling
                scene!


<b>165   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT          165

      And he is standing on the stage.

<b>                             PROLOGUE
</b>                Let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
                on your imaginary forces work.

      King James' watches enthusiastically, Robert Cecil
      right next to him.

<b>                             JAMES I
</b>                We had seen some of this Shakespeare's
                plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I
                must tell you, we enjoyed them
                immensely, and look forward to seeing
                many more, now that we are in
                London... I presume you are as avid a
                theater man as myself?

      Robert Cecil's smile remains frozen.

<b>                             ROBERT CECIL
</b>                Of course, your majesty...

      The CAMERA moves away from them and we realize we are
      on the theater stage where we started.


<b>166   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - STAGE - DUSK                      166

      "Prologue" turns and addresses his audience (and us) in
      the modern theater.

<b>                              PROLOGUE
</b>                Robert Cecil remained the most powerful
                man in the Court of King James, though he
                could not prevent the public theaters
                from becoming ever more popular. William
                Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining
                years of his life not in the playhouses
                of London, but in the small town of his
                birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a
                businessman and grain merchant.

<b>                        PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
</b>          Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be
          the most celebrated playwright of his
          time, becoming England's first Poet
          Laureate. And in 1623, he wrote the
          dedication to the collected works of the
          man we call William Shakespeare.
                 (beat)
          And so... though our story is finished,
          our poet's is not. For his monument is
          ever-living, made not of stone but of
          verse, and it shall be remembered... as
          long as words are made of breath and
          breath of life.

The curtains close.
