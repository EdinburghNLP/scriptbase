Naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith, leader of the Boy Rangers, is appointed on a lark by the spineless governor of his state.
He is reunited with the state's senior senator--presidential hopeful and childhood hero, Senator Joseph Paine.
In Washington, however, Smith discovers many of the shortcomings of the political process as his earnest goal of a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor.
Taylor first tries to corrupt Smith and then later attempts to destroy Smith through a scandal.
