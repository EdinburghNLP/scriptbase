A driven Manhattan architect, Amy, relaxes at a resort and falls for the masseur, Virgil, blind since age 3 and assisted by his spinster sister.
He helps Amy hear and sense the world, giving her new spirit and a burst of creativity.
Over the sister's objections, Amy takes Virgil to New York for new, radical surgery.
He regains his sight.
He's disoriented and must learn to process these new images.
Finding his place in a seeing world strains his relation with Amy; his absent father wants to connect with him now that he can see; then, retinal disease threatens to undo the surgery.
Can love survive, will he find his new place and his old tranquillity, can Amy accommodate limits?
