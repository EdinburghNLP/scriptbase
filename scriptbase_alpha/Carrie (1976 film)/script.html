<b>                                           CARRIE
</b>


                                         Written by

                              Lawrence D. Cohen &amp; Stephen King




<b>   FADE IN:
</b>
   From an absolutely glistening WHITE ­ an image which first appears to be a
   brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid
   matter, less of a mystery. It's the

<b>   EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) ­ DAY
</b>
1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,
   spotless ­ a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.

   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems
   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to
   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.

   We hear a woman's voice:

                                 MARGARET (o.s.)
                          Carrie! Carrie

   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,
   which initially involves:

<b>2. STELLA HORAN ­ DAY
</b>
   An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy
   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.

   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in
   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming
   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.

<b>3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE ­ STELLA
</b>
   As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-
   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.

<b>                                VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                          What are those?
<b>                                                                                                    2
</b>
<b>4. STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE
</b>
  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-
  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a
  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella
  through the hedge.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
                                (turning down the radio)
                         How long have you been there?

<b>                               CARRIE
</b>                               (not smiling; pointing with her finger)
                         What are those?

  Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing
  her breasts ­ white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit ­ not out of any particular
  modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         Those are my breasts, honey.

<b>                                 CARRIE
</b>                                 (a beat; then solemnly)
                         I wish I had some.

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         You will. `Course you'll have to wait a
                         couple of years, but ­

<b>                               CARRIE
</b>                               (a fact)
                         No I won't.

<b>                               STELLA
</b>                         Why, sure you will.

<b>                                CARRIE
</b>                                (emphatic)
                         No, I won't.
                                (glancing behind her)
                         Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't.
<b>                                                                                                   3
</b>

<b>                                  STELLA
</b>                                  (at something of a loss)
                   Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?

<b>5    CARRIE
</b>    Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door.
    She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:

<b>                                      CARRIE
</b>                   ...dirtypillows.

<b>                                      STELLA
</b>                   What?

<b>                                 CARRIE
</b>               Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them
               `cuz she was bad when she made me.

<b>6   STELLA
</b>
    Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she
    too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.

    She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.

<b>                                   STELLA
</b>                           Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real
                           hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and
                           get us some lemonade, would you like that?

<b>7   CARRIE
</b>
    Clearly torn ­ tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror ­ as if she expected the
    earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.

<b>                                      STELLA
</b>                           C'mon.
                                    (offering her hand)
                           It'll be our secret.

    Carrie ­ now really scared ­ shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.
<b>                                                                                                    4
</b>
<b>                                    CARRIE
</b>                         I can't!

<b>                                STELLA
</b>                         Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and ­

  And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house.
  Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably
  MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets
  out a bloodcurdling scream:

<b>                            MARGARET
</b><b>                  CAARRIEETTAAA!!!
</b>
<b> 8 CARRIE, STELLA
</b>   Both frozen by this terrible sound

<b> 9 STELLA'S POV ­ CLOSER ON CARRIE
</b>
  As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks
  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she
  seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry?

  And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the
  White house as fast her legs can carry her.

<b>10. STELLA
</b>
  Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a
  moment.

  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White
  house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs
  that she's sorry, that she forgot.

<b>                               STELLA
</b>                         Mother!
                               (louder)
                         Mother!
<b>                                                                                                     5
</b>
<b>11. THE HORAN HOUSE
</b>
  As MRS. HORAN ­ in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back ­ rushes out
  to answer to her daughter's call.

<b>                                 MRS. HORAN
</b>                          What in the name of God? What's the matter?

<b>                                  STELLA
</b>                                  (frantic)
                          I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me,
                          and Mrs. White started screaming and...

<b>12. THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge
  glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct
  babble of another:

                                  MARGARET (v.o.)
                          I told you to stay away from there, I told you....

                                 CARRIE (v.o.)
                          I'm sorry, Momma.

                                   MARGARET (v.o.)
                          ...to stay away from that girl, that whore...

                                  CARRIE (v.o.)
                          Please, Momma!

                                  MARGARET (v.o.)
                          ... of Babylon!

  Which continues over:

<b>13. TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
</b>
  Their eyes riveted on the house ­ trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.

                         The child...

  At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases
  in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness;
  as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then
  suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet ­ dead quiet.

<b>14 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  As it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING sound, and then what
  appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.

  Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. And then another, and another,
  and...

<b>15 TIGHTER TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
</b>
  squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles.

<b>16 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones ­ WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air
  like miniature bombs.

  Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.

  Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.

  One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING
  SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.

  The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.

</b>

<b>17. TWO SHOT ­ MRS. HORAN AND STELLA
</b>
  Frozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the
  SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout
  screaming:

<b>                                 MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                          Stop that! Stop that!

  Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms ­ a
  healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this
  nightmarish moment.

<b>18 THE HOUSE
</b>
  As still larger stones hail from the sky.

  And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.

<b>19 TWO SHOT ­ THE WOMEN
</b>
  Mrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on
  the lawn. Once again, it's quiet.

<b>20 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
  As one final stone ­ this one the size of a mere pebble ­ falls from the roof and plops onto
  the lawn.

  The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen
  once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.

<b>  MAIN TITLES.
</b>
<b>21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ MORNING
</b>
  Now some years later ­ and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the
  front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the
  doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs
  behind her.
<b>                                                                                                   8
</b>

  She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress ­ much too long, not so much out of style as utterly
  without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we
  glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.

  As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:

<b>                                   MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                         Carrie!

  Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.

<b>                               CARRIE
</b>                         Yes, Momma.

<b>                               MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                         You come straight home from school.

  A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:

<b>                                CARRIE
</b>                                (sweetly)
                         I always do, Momma.

  Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.

<b>22. EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
  As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of
  which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No
  one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From
  the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.

<b>23 EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ DAY
</b>
  Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her
  house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,
  an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us
  about this possibility, there is MUSIC.

<b>24 BOBBY ERBETER
</b>
  About five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on
  a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels.
<b>                                                                                                    9

                          Carrie, praying Carrie!

   Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the
   background:

   Bobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her.

   Or as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned,

  He sets down the paper, and looks at the class.

<b>27 FROMM'S POV ­ THE CLASS
</b>
  We will see, among others, Carrie.

  We also see TOMMY ROSS ­ a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking,
  clean-cut, intelligent, athletic.

<b>28 FROMM
</b>
  He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement.

<b>                                  FROMM
</b>                         I must say ­ I must confess ­ this poem displays an extraordinary

                                  (the knife)
                         ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.

<b>29 THE CLASS
</b>
  All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands
  over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off;
  he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it.

<b>30 FROMM

<b>                              FROMM

                       touchdown... Any criticisms?

<b>31 THE CLASS
</b>
  The usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up.

<b>32 FROMM
</b>
  He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering.

<b>                              FROMM
</b>                       Carrie White?

   Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are
   on her. And she has to say something. So she does.

<b>                                 CARRIE
</b>                        It's... beautiful.

<b> 34 FROMM
</b>
   He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.

<b>                        FROMM
</b>                `Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious
                skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?

   The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy. Tommy looks at
   her, and away, embarrassed. Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.

<b>                        FROMM
</b>                That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White.
                        (looking around)
                Anyone else?
                        (no one else)
                Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White
                          to say something!

   Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion.
   Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something. Or to be specific:

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>                        (muttering)

                  I said... `shucks.'

   But everyone in the class knows.

<b>36 EXT. VOLLEYBALL COURT ­ DAY
</b>
 Two teams of girls, among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, CORA and
 RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE
 SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a
 whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball
 to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.
 When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:

<b>                       COLLINS
</b>                Okay, now. This is game point.

 This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team
 as Carrie).

<b>                      RHONDA
</b>                      (giving the score)
                Twenty ­ Twenty.

 The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley
 it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes
 over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her
 success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.

 The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost
 trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.

 Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line ­ straight into the net.

 Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you know!" and "Dumbo!"
 reinforcing them. Chris storms back toward Carrie.

<b>                      CHRIS
</b>                      (low, harsh)

 Miss Collins blows her WHISTLE.

<b>37 INT SHOWER ROOM ­ DAY
</b>
  Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual
  showers. They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints,
  talk of college ­ all of which we hear from separate stalls.

  One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps,
  toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air.
  So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.

  `...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister's husband picks his nose... So does your
  sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... I'm going with Billy, we'll
  meet you... Friday night...'

  We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the
  shower. She claps her hands together once, smartly.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                 What are you waiting for, Carrie?
                          (as Carrie looks at her)
                 Bell in five minutes.

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                 Oh uh?

  As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone
  in her shower stall. She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders,
  moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes
  out of frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame ­ full of blood. And
  just as she and we see this, so do the girls.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

  Carrie stares at her dumbly.

  The other girls are quick to take up the chant. Chris leads them.

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

  One voice chimes in:

<b>                          NORMA
</b><b>                                                                                             14
</b>
                Plug it up!

Others take up this new chant. For a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the
new chant emerges solely:

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

Dime-sized drops are striking the tile floor at Carrie's feet.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                For God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period.
                       (as Carrie turns toward her)
                Clean yourself up!

Carrie seems bewildered.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                       (furiously)
                You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, you're bleeding!

Carrie looks down and wails, the sound is very loud.

A tampon strikes Carrie's chest, plops to her feet. Carrie just stares at it.

<b>                        NORMA
</b>                She thinks they're for lipstick.

Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up.

Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her
with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on
the wall. As they bombard Carrie:

<b>                        GIRLS
</b>                Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up....

We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be
caught up in what can only be described as a fury.

Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder.

The door is flung open by Collins.

<b>                        COLLINS
</b><b>                                                                                               15
</b>
                What is this?

And she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is
louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't).

And there is sudden silence.



<b>                       COLLINS
</b>                       (to girls)
                Get out! Get out!

The girls retreat, Sue last.

<b>                        SUE
</b>                It must be her first...

<b>                        COLLINS
</b>                Out!

As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins
slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                M... M... Miss Collins...

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                I'm bleeding.

One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody
handprint.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>                Damn you!

She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser.

</b>                   What...?

   HENRY MORTON, the principal, a decent but somewhat plodding man in his mid-forties, is
   tapping out his pipe as he talks to Collins.

<b>                           MORTON
</b>                   Isn't she a bit old for her...

   Well, he can't quite say it.

              Her first period?

<b>                     COLLINS
</b>              Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there
              was such a thing.

He hesitates a moment ­ noticing Carrie's bloody handprint on Collins' gym shorts.

<b>                      MORTON
</b>              It's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high
              school wouldn't know... something... the facts.

<b>                     COLLINS

              Miss Collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd
              understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs.
              As for the girls ­

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>              Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they...

<b>                     MORTON
</b>              You'll have to do something.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>              I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole
              thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her.

<b>                  MORTON
</b>              Ummm.

<b>                       COLLINS

<b>                          MORTON
</b>                          (fiddling with paper clips on his desk)
                Oh.

The door is opened. Carrie stands in the doorway.

<b>                      MORTON
</b>                Come in, Cassie.

Collins starts to correct him, but:

<b>                        MORTON
</b>                Close the door. No, wait.
                        (up)
                Miss Finch, bring in a dismissal slip.
                        (to Carrie)
                I think you might take the rest of the day and go home
                and, uh, well... take care of yourself, Cassie.

<b>                          CARRIE

<b>                       MORTON
</b>                We're all sorry about this incident.

MISS FINCH, elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip, brings it to
Morton who initials it.

<b>                      MORTON
</b>                      (to Finch, as she goes)
                Thank you.
                      (to Carrie)
                Would you like to go to the infirmary?...

Carrie is shaking her head.

<b>                         MORTON
</b>                ...lie down for a while...

<b>                        COLLINS
</b>                I think Carrie can go home.
<b>                                                                                               19
</b>
<b>                        MORTON
</b>                  Would you like a ride?

   Again, Carrie is shaking her head.

<b>                        MORTON
</b>                  We could call you a cab.

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                  I'm sure she can walk home. And Carrie, you're excused
                  from gym for a week. Take study hall instead.

   Morton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to Carrie.

<b>                         MORTON
</b>                  We are sorry about this, Cassie.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                         (sudden fury)
                  That's not my name!

   Two things happen simultaneously; Morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little
   and then tumbles from the desk.

   Then Carrie goes out.

   Morton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a
   moment, then looks at Collins.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                          (slowly)
                  That reminds me. A light blew out while I was
                  trying to calm her down.

<b>                           MORTON
</b>                  I'll send a janitor to fix it.

   Okay, that's reality. He puts the ashtray back on the desk decisively, dismissing any
   "peculiar" thought he may have had.

<b>50 EXT. ANOTHER STREET ­ DAY

  A quiet residential street in a lower middle-class neighborhood. Carrie is walking down the
 street, slowly.

  There comes Bobby Erbeter again on his bike, paralleling Carrie (as before)

  CLOSE now, featuring her eyes most prominently. Her face is uncertain, confused. What
 just happened? She thought (that's right, thought) something and it happened...

  And we HEAR another SCREAM, more of an angry shriek, and then the strange sight and
 SOUND of:

  Screaming with anger (more than anything else) as he disentangles himself. He stands up,
 looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist.

</b>                         (defiantly)

  The boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering. Then she opens her eyes,
 wider. She looks at the boy. She frowns for a moment.

  The stones.

  The light bulb exploding.

  The ashtray falling.

  We hear:

  Eleanor frowns momentarily, leaves the kitchen.

   Standing in the doorway. She is a large lady dressed in black, carrying a worn black leather
  sack, which we will discover is bulging with religious tracts.

<b>68 ELEANOR WITH MARGARET

  Margaret White is not a welcome visitor, but Eleanor Snell is a polite lady.

<b>                       ELEANOR
</b>                 Oh, Mrs. White.

<b>                        ELEANOR

 An impasse. Finally Eleanor feels constrained to open the door wider, put a smile on her
face, and:

</b>               Won't you come in, Mrs. White?

<b>                     MARGARET

She steps inside and Eleanor closes the door behind her, saying:

<b>                       ELEANOR
</b>               I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.

Margaret is fishing tracts out of her bag.

<b>                      MARGARET

Eleanor looks at the tracts with pretended interest

</b>                 My Sue is a good girl.

   Humor ­ and she regrets it immediately.

   She hangs up, opens a drawer, takes out some hidden household money (a couple of bills),
  and drags herself back into the living room.

<b>70 INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM ­ DAY

   Margaret is still where we left her.

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>                Thank you. I'll give you a receipt.

</b>                Thank you, Mrs. White.

   What can one say? Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness
 like a steel, middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves.
 Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, seeing:

  Sue is coming toward the door. She passes Margaret with a quick (inaudible) greeting and
 hurries to the front door where her mother is waiting.

                ...and I gave her a donation.

  Sue's face betrays relief, but Eleanor notices nothing.

<b>                       ELEANOR
</b>                       (brightly)
                Well, how was school today?
<b>                                                                                                 27
</b>
<b>                        SUE
</b>                  Today? Like always.

    HOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret
   leaves). A long beat, then:

<b>                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>72 CARRIE
</b>
    Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street.
   She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe ­ her plain dress and school books
   on the narrow bed.

    She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen" ­ absorbed in the
   mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men.
   An escape of sorts.

   And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's
   decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would
   allow in exchange for her own prices ­ a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an
   equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various
   religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.

<b>73 ANGLE ­ FEATURING CARRIE
</b>
   Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick
   Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's
   about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to
   see:

<b>74 EXT THE STREET ­ MARGARET
</b>
   As this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be
   coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.

<b>75 CLOSEUP ­ CARRIE
</b>
   Her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier ­ a scared little girl
   now encased in the body of an adolescent.

   As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat,
   Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear
   the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea.
<b>                                                                                                  28
</b>
  And then the telephone RINGS ­ only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as
  Carrie dreaded ­ it's the school ­ and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear
  Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice ­ not
  yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity ­ she calls up the stairs:

<b>                        MARGARET'S VOICE
</b>                 I know you're listening. Come downstairs.

  And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:

<b>76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIE
</b>
  As she hurries down toward her mother and into:

<b>77 INT WHITE KITCHEN ­ DAY
</b>
  Where Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Hello, Momma.

  No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether
  strange little kitchen ­ a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art ­ Margaret is a rock.
<b>                                                                                                29
</b>
  Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she
  recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've
  been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Who was it that called?
                       (no response)
                 What did they say?

<b>78 MARGARET
</b>
  Point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns
  from the stove.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                        (softly)
                 You're a woman now.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                 Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared...

  Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then
  opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her
  face:

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was
                 weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was
                 called Sin ­ `

  She pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place.

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 ...and the raven was called sin...

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma ­

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                         (overriding)
                 ...and the raven was called Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse.
<b>                                                                                              30
</b>

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me
               and threw things and ­

Margaret's hand flashes out, backhanding Carrie into the wall. It's a wallop of a slap, the
sting of it bringing tears to her eyes.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault.

Another backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma!

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>               And Eve was weak and... say it, woman!

Kick.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma, please help me.

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>               And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               They threw things...

<b>                       MARGARET
</b>                       (overriding)
               ...and the raven was called Sin... Sin! ...and the first sin
               was intercourse.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma, please listen.

A kick.

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>               And the Lord visited Eve with a curse, and the curse
               was the Curse of Blood!
<b>                                                                                               31
</b>
The teakettle starts to WHISTLE.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               You should have told me!

Margaret clutches Carrie's wrist in a vise.

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>                     (heavenward)
               O Lord, help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways.
               Show her that if she had remained sinless ­

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               No!

<b>                       MARGARET
</b>               -- the Curse of Blood would never have come on her. She may have
               been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of
               Lustful Thoughts.

The teakettle is WHISTLING louder ­ a high-pitched scream.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               No, Momma.

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>               Don't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now I can see inside
               you? I can see your sin just as surely as God can.

<b>                   CARRIE
</b>               Momma, let me go.

Margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet.

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>               We will pray. We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for
               our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls...

She switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an
ominous blue light. A vision of a wrathful God. Throughout the following, Carrie struggles
desperately, but she's no match for her mother.
<b>                                                                                                32
</b>
<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse
                 of Blood. And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of
                 Childbearing, and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood!

  She propels Carrie into the closet, slams the door behind her. Margaret's voice continues,
  overlapping onto:

<b>79 INT. CLOSET ­ CARRIE ­ DAY
</b>
  Very much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of the closet ­ crying, disheveled,
  beaten. The closet is just what every child ever dreaded about the night.

<b>80 JESUS
</b>
  Looking down at Carrie.

<b>81 CARRIE
</b>
  She looks away ­ and inwards. With her, we see:

<b>82 SPLATS OF BLOOD
</b>
  Falling on the shower floor.

<b>83 THE GIRLS ­ IN THE SHOWER ROOM
</b>
  Surrounding Carrie, jeering her, bombarding her.

<b>84 JESUS
</b>
  Impassive, impersonal, unconcerned ­ or so it seems.

<b>85 CHRIS ­ IN THE SHOWER ROOM
</b>
  In the forefront of the pack.

<b>86 CARRIE ­ IN THE SHOWER ROOM
</b>
  As the girls would see her, cowering, the bloody napkins pelting her.

<b>87 JESUS ­ CLOSER ANGLE
</b>
  The blood seems to be streaming down his face; it moves.
<b>                                                                                           33
</b>
<b>88 CARRIE ­ IN THE CLOSET
</b>
  Tears are streaming down her face. She whispers:

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                Please!

<b>                                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>89 EXT. THE HILL ­ NIGHT
</b>
  MOVING IN SLOWLY on Tommy Ross' 1963 Ford, which is parked in the shadows on The
  Hill (something of a ridge which overlooks the town and is dedicated to Eros by high school
  students and occasional graduates). The MUSIC swells as we MOVE IN. And finally, we
  PEER into the car, where we see:

<b>90 INT. TOMMY'S FORD ­ NIGHT
</b>
  Sue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat. They are both putting their
  clothes in order, silently, slowly.

  Then they climb into the front seat. Sue takes out a cigarette. Tommy lights it with the
  dashboard lighter. They say nothing as Sue smokes for a few moments. Then Tommy looks
  at her closely.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>                Hey.

  She turns away.

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>                Hey, what's the matter?

  He puts his arm around her clumsily.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                Nothing.

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>                What did I do?

<b>                       SUE
</b>                Nothing. It's not you.
<b>                                                                                     34

<b>                      TOMMY

</b>                      (blurting)
              It's Carrie.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>              Who?

<b>                      SUE
</b>              Carrie. Carrie White.

<b>                     TOMMY

<b>                     SUE
</b>                     (sharply)
              Don't call her that.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>                       (imitating Carrie)
              It's... beautiful.
                       (laughing)
              That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me.

<b>                   SUE
</b>              Tommy, please...

<b>                      TOMMY

              That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White.
                      (exploding)
              Jesus!

Sue has turned away from him.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>              Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it.

</b>               Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you?

She is crying, that's what.

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>               Hey, are you crying?
                      (yes, stupid)
               Are you?

He tries to turn her toward him. She struggles. Manfully, he forces her around.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>               Jesus, Sue, what is it?

<b>                       TOMMY

<b>                      SUE

<b>                                                                           36
</b>
<b>      SUE
</b>We were hurting her ­

<b>       TOMMY
</b>She's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her
knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And
the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it.

<b>     SUE
</b>     (vehemently)
How would you like to be Carrie White?

<b>     TOMMY
</b>How would I like to be Carrie White?

<b>       SUE
</b>How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be
Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular.

<b>        TOMMY
</b>What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up
and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and
Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe
married with a bunch of kids...
        (stops)
What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?

<b>        SUE
</b>I did something wrong and I feel bad about it.

<b>        TOMMY
</b>I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid...

<b>       SUE
</b>       (interrupting)
I've got to do something about it.

<b>       TOMMY
</b>Like what?

<b>        SUE
</b>I don't know yet. Apologize.

<b>       TOMMY
</b>Okay, you tell her you're sorry.
<b>                                                                                        37
</b>
<b>                     SUE
</b>              That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.

<b>                    TOMMY
</b>              What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake?

<b>                     SUE
</b>              God, I hate you sometimes!

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>              What the hell do you want me to do?

<b>                     SUE
</b>              I want you to help me. Or are you just interested in fucking me?

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>                     (angrily)
              Don't say that!

<b>                     SUE
</b>              Fucking me, fucking me...

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>              Cut it out!

<b>                     SUE
</b>              Then help me!

Tommy moves back from Sue. He is looking at her, trying to figure her out. He wants to do
something, he doesn't want an argument, but...

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>              Okay, what can I do?

</b>               Jesus.

He stares off through the windshield. He is really puzzled. He steals a look at Sue. He starts
to put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly. Tommy stares off into space
again.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>               I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to
               think about.
                       (beat)
               She was always there ­ keeping to herself in that stupid dress ­ that
               weird mother.
                       (beat)
               You know what I mean?

Sue glances toward him. Of course she knows. And he is beginning to understand.

Tommy looks straight ahead again. He is starting to think. It's not all that easy.

<b>91 INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
  Margaret is at the sewing machine. She is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of
  Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays
  Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Let the Lower Lights Be Burning." A Black Forest cuckoo clock,
  providing a sense of lapsed time.

  Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself. The needle begins to dip up and
  down; the bobbin whirs and jerks.

  Margaret turns around to see:

<b>92 CARRIE
</b>
  She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm,
  almost too calm.

<b>93 MARGARET
</b>
  A touch of fear in her eyes. But:

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                  Go to bed.

<b>94 CARRIE
</b>
  She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the (unmoving) head.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  Good night, Momma.

  Carrie goes to the stairs.

</b>
  With Carrie.

<b>96 UPPER HALLWAY
</b>
  Carrie goes into her room.
<b>                                                                                                     40

<b>97 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>

  Carrie turns on a light. She undresses slowly, wearily. And then she stops and looks at
  herself in the mirror. A close, tired inspection. Her eyes seem hollow, haunted. Carrie
  doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself.

  Flex. Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs.

  Flex. The mirror cracks wider.

  And flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall
  on the floor.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 Carrie! Carrie? Carrie!

  A moment of utter panic ­ now what?

<b>98 HALLWAY STAIRS
</b>
  As Margaret strides up them, past the landing, and tries the knob on Carrie's door. It's
  locked. She rattles the knob. But to no avail. Then:

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 Carrie! Carrie, open this door!
                         (a beat; nothing)
                 Carrie!

  Another beat; then:

<b>                         CARRIE'S VOICE
</b>                         (sweetly)
                 It's open, Momma.

  Margaret tries the knob again, and it is, indeed, open.

<b>99 INT CARRIE'S ROOM
</b>
  Where Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel nightgown, praying.

<b>                       MARGARET
</b>                 What was that noise?

<b>                         CARRIE

</b>
                  Nothing, Momma.

   Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it
   is ­ whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the
   plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser.

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                  Go to bed.

   She leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly. And then:

   Flex.

   The door slams closed.

   Pausing for a second, then deciding it's better to go along without talking back. She sits
   down.

   Shifting nervously, unused to Collins' absolute no-nonsense tone.

   Taking a deep breath.

   the freckled, slightly pudgy girl sitting next to Sue ­ giggles nervously. But no one joins her,
   and she clasps her hand over her mouth, trying to stifle it.

   Glaring at Helen, silencing her.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                   Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings?

                   minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take

<b>                           COLLINS
</b>                   Well, isn't he the lucky one.

                  Okay. Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days'
                  suspension and refusal of your prom tickets.

<b>109 THE GIRLS
</b>
   As Collins' words sink in ­ groans of disappointment.

<b>110 SUE'S POV ­ COLLINS
</b>
   Almost seeming o single Sue out as she continues ­ at least that's the way it seems to Sue.

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                  That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd
                  deserve it ­ I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty
                  what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one
                  week's detention.

   The girls sigh with relief. Chris has a particularly smug look. Collins takes in their reactions;
   then she reels in the line:

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                  But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in
                  the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture?

<b>111 THE GIRLS
</b>
   As they realize just how they've been had ­ indeed, getting the picture.

<b>112 CHRIS
</b>
   Furious, defiant.

<b>                         CHRIS
</b>                  I won't come.

<b>113 COLLINS
</b>
   No less determined, but cool.
<b>                                                                                                  45
</b>
<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                   That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for
                   skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your
                   prom tickets. Any other thoughts?

<b>114 THE GIRLS
</b>
   Sober, slightly frightened.

   The girls start to turn.

   Collins watches the girls filing into the locker room, a small triumphant smile on her face.

<b>119 INT. HALL OUTSIDE GYM

   Carrie is now far down the hall, a small distant figure. Now she goes out of sight around a

   As the girls change silently into their green gym outfits ­ quiet, subdued, most of them
   resigned to their punishment. Chris, however, is about to blow up; she tosses her skirt into
   her locker and slams the door shut.

<b> 121 AN INDEX CARD ­ SCHOOL LIBRARY
</b>
    And then another, and another, and yet another flipping by us, one title following another as
    Carrie looms over the card catalog, searching. The title cards include POISON, POLITICS
    and POLTERGEISTS ­ on this latter card, it reads: "A ghost supposed to be responsible for
    table rappings and other mysterious, noisy disturbances." It also contains a cross-reference ­
    see tele ­ and the rest of the word is blurred.

    until she gets to:

<b>121C TELEKINESIS ­ A CLOSER SHOT

    On the word, and below it:

    `Thought to be the ability to move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind,
    perhaps a genetic-recessive in origin.'

   And Sue runs on, leaving Chris ­ red in the face, breathless, furious ­ behind. Chris

<b>127 CHRIS
</b>
   A mutineer without a single ally now. She realizes it and heads for the door leading to the
   locker room, and this time, Collins doesn't even try to stop her. At the door:

<b>                          CHRIS
</b>                  This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot.

   The local after-school hangout. Clusters of students milling in and around booths. Pinball
   machines, a jukebox thumping "NO WHERE TO RUN" by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas.

   Sue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as Chris enters, says hello to some of her
   clique, and spots her.

   Sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile. Chris slides into the booth across from

Sue slides the yearbook back across the table to Chris, who examines it:

   Sue turns and starts to walk out of the Cavalier. In the background behind her, it's all out of
   focus, an incoherent babble of snickering and clucking laughter. She's crossed the line.

<b>131 EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD ­ DAY

   Sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field. She is preoccupied, still shaken by the
   afternoon's confrontation with Chris. The track team is moving past the bleachers (a coach in
   the field clocking them and shouting orders). Tommy, in his track uniform, peels away from
   the group and comes running up to Sue.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>                  Sure, what's up?

   To avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them, and the other girls
   sitting in the bleachers half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing Tommy and Sue, Sue
   beckons Tommy to follow her away from the group behind the bleachers, and as they walk off
   together we hear the following:

</b>                  If I asked you to do something for me ­ something special ­ would you?

   A big hangout-cruising night on the boulevard. Neon, convertibles, "Rebel Without a Cause"
   meets "American Graffiti" seventies-style. In other words, the works -- with MUSIC.

<b>133 EXT. INTERSECTION ­ NIGHT
</b>
   As a '61 Chevy leaves a sizeable patch of rubber on the street as it GRINDS to a hard stop,
   just barely halting before it almost went through a red light and collided with the traffic
   already in the intersection.

   which belongs to the aforementioned BILLY NOLAN ­ a character whose life and brains
   stopped around the time he saw "Rebel" on television. He's Chris's boyfriend, and a huge
   cross swings around his neck. Right now, he's utterly amused by his harrowing driving, and
   turns to Chris who ignores him, still brooding over her afternoon losses. Billy takes a huge
   toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself
   applying makeup in the visor window. So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some
   banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light. The light changes, and Billy peels
   out ­ an action with throws Chris backwards onto the seat.

<b>                        CHRIS
</b>                   Goddamnit, Billy!

   He slams on the brakes, and pulls into:

   LOOKING DOWN on a parking lot where cars are parked; a huge pullman's car which has
   been converted into a restaurant. This after-school hangout is called the Cavalier.

   As Billy reaches over, very confidently, to draw Chris to him.

   She lets herself be kissed, then pulls away abruptly.

   He grabs at her, and she pulls away.

She pushes him away.

He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the
buttons are ripped off.

He slaps her.

Silence. Then, after some time, he leans over and kisses her. She lets him. He kisses her
again, and she responds. He goes at it. And she squirms away.

   She moves closer to him. Her hand dips down out of FRAME. She blows in his ear. Billy is
   beginning to writhe; he moves in on her, but she holds him off, playing him like a puppet.

  Carrie is lying in bed, motionless, asleep.

  Margaret crosses the room quietly. She leans over the bed. On the table next to it is the
  glow-in-the-dark statue ­ not in its usual place on the dresser. Carrie's face, in the soft light,
  seems very innocent.

  No answer.

  Margaret bends over Carrie. And with surprising tenderness, she kisses Carrie's forehead.

  The she straightens up quickly, as though she has violated herself, and leaves the room.

  Carrie opens her eyes. She pulls a book out from under the covers; then she stares at the
  Madonna-child figurine, it begins to glow brighter and brighter, illuminating the room. It's

</b>                 How're you doing?

<b>                           CARRIE
</b>                           (after a beat; almost inaudibly)
                 Okay.

It's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make small talk is agonizing. But try it,
he does:

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>               I thought you had gym this period.

All she can do is shake her head. And a young man not easily deterred, he tries again.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>                     (continuing)
               What're you reading?

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                       (trying to cover, and not very well)
               It's about... um.. sewing...

Right. Check and stalemate. Which brings him to:

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>               Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want
               to go with me?

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               What?

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>               The Prom...

Without saying a word, Carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves. He follows her into the
main room where students are reading, working.

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>                        (continuing)
               ...It's next Friday, and I know this is later notice, but they stop selling

The bell RINGS.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               I don't like to be tricked.

A couple of students stare at Tommy talking to Carrie as they start leaving the library.

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>               Carrie...

But it's too late ­ she's gone, already out the door.

<b>                                                                                       CUT TO:

As Tommy weaves through the crowd after her. Gangly GEORGE DAWSON spots him:

<b>                     GEORGE
</b>               Hey, Ross!

But Tommy ignores him in his singular pursuit.

<b>                     TOMMY
</b>               Hey, Carrie! Wait!

A couple of other students watch this ­ is this their Tommy Ross actually trying to speak with
Carrie? But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering ­ all he wants is to catch up with
Carrie.

Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact. She turns
around, her head painfully ducked down.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>                       (continuing)
               Hey, it's no big deal.

And she looks up and stares at him with that peculiar intensity that cuts through all the clamor
around them. Quiet, quietly:

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever?

A beat. Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is. Seeing that
she's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is:

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>               Sorry.

But it's too little, and too late. She's crying. And what's more, she's gone ­ swallowed up
into the clamor of students rushing to beat the bell. Which RINGS as we:

  As Collins tidies up after one of the classes ­ throwing towels into huge cans, etc. Only to
  hear a mewing, whimpering sound and come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the dark
  corners of the room, crying. It's almost as if she created her own closet of space.

</b>                   Carrie's been asked to the prom.

    Morton goes into a coughing fit, accidentally knocking over his coffee in the process. Collins
    watches, slightly amused by his reaction. When he recovers:

<b>                         MORTON

Just as this point, NORMA WATSON ­ a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal
discretion could make the telephone obsolete ­ enters the room with a sheaf of attendance
sheets for the next week. All conversation ceases.

<b>                     COLLINS
</b>                     (continuing)
               Yes, Norma? What is it?

<b>                       NORMA
</b>               Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

<b>                       COLLINS
</b>               Just leave them on the desk.
                       (to Sue)
               You understand, you can't come without a date?

Sue understands perfectly well, but with Norma there, she's not about to say a word. And
Collins finally picks up on this:

<b>                       COLLINS
</b>                       (continuing)
               Is there something else, Norma?

</b>                     (butter could melt)
               No, Miss Collins.

<b>147 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ DAY

   As Tommy's Volkswagen parks across the street, Tommy gets out and approaches the White
   house.

    Carrie is inside, watching him come up the stairs. She remains on the hall side of the screen
   door.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>                  So this is where you live.

She shakes her head; he laughs again, a little nervously. Throughout this scene in which he
remains on the porch side of the screen door, he catches glimpses of the weird house within.

Carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused. She'd really
like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting.

<b>                    CARRIE

   And in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not "liked" her poem, had Margaret not
   called, perhaps she could have held back.

<b>                          CARRIE

                  Thank you.

   Tommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door. A
   goodbye, nothing more. He goes down the walk toward his car.

window. Carrie is silent, watching herself being shut out.

   Leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a

   completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an
   occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT ­ trailing behind. De Lois is swinging
   a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest
   and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance.

                  It's a good joke, Billy.

   Trennant giggles again.

   Garson is stoned silly ­ zonked, deadpan. He greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into
   oblivion before our eyes.

   De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers.

</b>                  His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God!

   Trennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start
   laughing, too. Even De Lois starts laughing.

   The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting:

    The sun is shining ­ perhaps the next day, a day later. The house is a picture postcard ­ under
    it, we hear the sweet, muffled sound of "Amazing Grace." It's just loud enough for us to hear
    it ­ joyous, triumphant.

<b>160A. INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM ­ AFTERNOON
</b>
    Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix.

    The sampler, however, sits in her lap ­ unfinished, unminded. She's virtually catatonic.

    "Amazing Grace" ­ a sweet, contemporary rendition ­ is on the Webcor. A pleasure after
    Kathryn Kuhlman.

    Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress. She
    removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>                   Red. I might have known it would be red.

    The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING.

    Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. She looks back at Margaret,
    then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling.

    Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.

    The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down... WHIRRING, jerking.

    The side wheel spins. And then stops.

    She smiles. Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room.

    Margaret looks after her. Hate. And fear.

There's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we:

   Very dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound
   of a:

<b>162 WINDOW
</b>
   Being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face ­ just whose isn't clear yet. The
   slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right
   behind him.

<b>163 LONG SHOT ­ THE GYM
</b>
   As a flashlight is shined upwards ­ at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at
   banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular ­
   the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be
   crowned.

<b> 164 TWO SHOT ­ BILLY AND CHRIS
</b>
   DOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area ­ past the numerous
   tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest,
   Chris the flashlight.

<b> 165 ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   As they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex
   rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine.

<b>166 CHRIS' POV ­ BILLY
</b>
   Looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a
   narrow platform overlooking the stage area.

                       (no answer; genuinely scared)
               Billy!

And just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the FRAME and lands in Chris's
hair. She jumps, utterly unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the
platform, grinning.

  CUTTING between the final arrangements for the prom itself and Carrie's preparations as the
  night approaches. The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage ­
  scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC ­ will also feature some of our lesser
  characters.

  Among other things, we will see:

             A) THE GYM ­ as last-minute arrangements are made ­ more crepe paper hung,
         party favors put on tables, etc.;

             B) CARRIE ­ in a town store as she shops for makeup;

            C) NORMA WATSON ­ under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a
         manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted;

             D) TOMMY ­ picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist;

             E) CARRIE ­ at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't
         see), a happy look on her face;

            F) THE GYM ­ as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage
         wall;

             G) SUE ­ having dinner with her parents

            H) THE TWINS ­ in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on
         enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously;

            I) ERNEST ­ the class president ­ making sure the microphone on the stage
         works;

             J) THE BAND ­ among them, The Beak, setting up;

             K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act;

            L) A DOOR ­ which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them
         several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates;

             M) GEORGE AND FRIEDA ­ he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as
         Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember;

            N) THE GYM ­ with the adult chaperones ­ teachers, administrators ­ standing
         around, looking for something to do.

<b>171 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
  Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. And a
  different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's
  dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way
  that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks...
  well, there has been a transformation.

  In the background, the door is opened by Margaret.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Come in, Momma.

  Margaret advances into the room.

  Carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                 Do you want to pin it on, Momma?

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 I can see your dirtypillows. Everyone will.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them.

  Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this
  scene ­ and all that follow for a considerable period of time ­ has an edge of unreality to it.
  It's all been diffused a bit ­ a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes. What would look bad or tacky
  looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 Take off that dress.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                 No.
<b>                                                                                                84

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>               We'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               No, Momma.

The Black Forest CUCKOO CLOCK sings out downstairs. It's eight o'clock.

<b>                      MARGARET
</b>               He's not coming.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               Stop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough.

Margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark. She looks toward
Carrie.

Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself.

Margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               Stop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either.

Margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               Go away, Momma.

<b>                     MARGARET
</b>               You know I'm right. He'll laugh at you. They'll all laugh at you.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>               No. It'll be okay.

Bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room.
Cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue. But it's sheer will at
this point. It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy.

<b>                       MARGARET
</b>               It's not too late. You can stay here with me.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               No.
<b>                                                                                                85

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                 I'll answer the door and say you're sick, I'll say ­

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>                 Momma, sit on the bed.

  Flex.

  Margaret is pushed back on the bed. Horrified, she rises again.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>                 I'll say that you changed your mind, I'll say ­

  Margaret is thrust back on the bed.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                 `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

  The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's
  voice is soft and compassionate.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                 You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that

  The BUZZER downstairs sounds. Carrie goes to her window and sees:

<b>172 CARRIE'S POV ­ TOMMY
</b>
  at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, making it glisten. He looks very
  handsome.

  She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret:

  The BUZZER downstairs sounds again.

                 I love you, Momma.

  And she's gone, down the

  Carrie who opens the door.

<b>175 ANGLE ON TOMMY

  Well, we know he's beautiful. And he's looking at Carrie. He didn't know:

  He reaches out his hand.

  Carrie takes his hand.

   Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie

   She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light.

<b>183 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT ­ NIGHT

   The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them,
   Tommy's Ford.

<b>184 INT. TOMMY'S CAR
</b>
   as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars.
   Tommy watches her taking it all in.

<b>                           CARRIE
</b>                  It's like a dream.

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>                  You can still change your mind, you know.

   She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her.

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                  Easier said than done.

<b>                           TOMMY

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  No. Please ­ not yet.

<b>                         TOMMY

                        (beat)
                  Can we sit here another minute?

   Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable ­ she's happy to be with
   Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first
   time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                  Tommy...
                       (and then out it comes)
                  Maybe... maybe this was a mistake.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>                  Hey, it won't be so bad.

   She tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>                  Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see.
                          (beat; she's trying to believe him)
                  Don't be nervous. Besides...
                          (a little self-mocking)
                  I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.

   And that's just enough ­ he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.

<b>185 INT. GYM
</b>
   where the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of "Harlem
   Nocturne." From Carrie's POV it's all magic ­ explosions of pastel color, everyone looking
   like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.

   Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in
   as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the
   stage wall ­ full of celestial moon, stars and rockets ­ a VOICE bellows out behind her.

<b>                        VOICE
</b>                  Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.

<b>186 GEORGE DAWSON
</b>
  The source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend. He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a
  T-shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket. His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags
  behind.

<b>                        TOMMY
</b>                  When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?

<b>                          GEORGE
</b>                  Ross, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have
                  asked you instead of Frieda.

  The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.

<b>                         FRIEDA
</b>                  Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.

  Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence.

<b>                        FRIEDA
</b>                  Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.

</b>                         (unaffected surprise)
                  Made it? No shit.

  Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>                  No shit.

  Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye
  on Carrie. He shrugs ­ it's working, goddammit ­ and he stuffs his hands into his dinner
  jacket.

<b>188 MONTAGE
</b>
   As the prom gets underway:

              A) JOSIE AND THE MOONGLOWS ­ THE BAND ­ make like Lawrence Welk
          and launch into an oldie-but-goodie. On drums ­ The Beak himself.
              B) THE TWINS ­ CORA AND RHONDA ­ dressed identically, dancing with
              C) ERNEST PETERSON, the black class president, is wonderfully officious as he
          gets the evening's first entertainment organized. It (or she) is ­
              D) SANDRA STENCHFIELD and her fabulous twirling baton act, a phenomenon
          to the lilting STRAINS of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."
              E) NORMA is off in a corner, bending another girl's ear; STAN is standing idly
          by, pretending to be invisible.
              F) MORTON, FROMM and the other chaperones including MISS FISH look for
          something to do, for someone who's stepping out of line. And find it. In the person of
          FREDDY DE LOIS, who's guzzling the punch.
              G) TOMMY and CARRIE sit at their table next to GEORGE and FRIEDA.
          Tommy lights a candle.

   He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, Frieda shrugging
   helplessly at Carrie.

Tommy nods ­ it's okay with him.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>               Carrie?

Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins ­ dressed up, looking more like one of the
students than a teacher.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               You look very pretty, Miss Collins.

<b>                     COLLINS

</b>               It's awfully nice of you to say so. I know I'm not... not really...
               but thank you anyway.

Tommy ­ feeling like a fifth wheel ­ clears his throat and stands up.

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>               `scuse me.

He goes off into the crowd.

<b>                         COLLINS
</b>                         (gesturing to his seat)
               May I?

Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this
moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied.

<b>                       COLLINS

               But it's over with. It's over.

Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular
moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number ­ slow, romantic.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>               I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I
               went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed
               with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never
               had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               It's very... nice.

               Just nice?

<b>                         CARRIE
</b>               No. There's more. I don't know...
                         (hesitating; then)
               ...it's like being on Mars.

<b>                      COLLINS
</b>               You'll never forget it.

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               I think you're right.

And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly.

<b>                     CARRIE
</b>               Thank you.

                         (he means it)
                 Then it's settled.

  He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor.

<b>                      CARRIE

  He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man
  of considerable confidence ­ the best part of his popularity ­ and it's a contagious trait.
  Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less
  awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her
  freedom.

<b>190 A CORNER OF THE GYM

  Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some
  moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward,
  about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is
  immediately embarrassed.

</b>               No harm, no foul.

They stand there for a couple of seconds.

And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A
bird peck.

And again they stand there, until:

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>               I don't know... anything. I can't dance...

<b>                     TOMMY

<b>                       CARRIE

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>               It's easy.

And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him.

<b>                    CARRIE
</b>               Tommy... why?

</b>               Why? Why did you?

<b>                     TOMMY

He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.

<b>                       TOMMY
</b>               ...you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>               Oh.

She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>                      (quickly)

A commotion from the floor.

Tommy turns.

Carrie looks off, following his glance, at:

   of George.

   Carrie examines the paper.

                  can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.

   Carrie looks up at the stage ­ at the massive thrones all in white.

   Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away ­ at the
   tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it.

</b>                 Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty.

  She laughs aloud ­ the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand
  over her mouth, at her own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names ­ so
  quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. She gasps.

<b>                        TOMMY

   The BAND plays another FANFARE OF DRUMS. Ernest sees this as his big moment; he
   almost drops the ballots. He pauses for a moment, surveying the gym floor and the anxious
   prom-goers. An actors savoring the tension. Then he smiles, white teeth grinning:

   Silence. Everything a half-beat exaggerated, slowed.

   Carrie gasps inwardly; the candle in front of her blows out.

   Tommy grins, amused. He shrugs his shoulders at Carrie.

   And the applause begins ­ some of it, most of it, genuine, but some of it mocking too.

   The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and Circumstance."

   Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table. George is pounding Tommy's back. An
   aluminum foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over
   Carrie's shoulders.

   Dollying as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of smiling faces, the APPLAUSE

   In the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier
   ­ the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage ­ jiggles, and Sue notices it move.
   She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to:

   Concealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile:

<b>225 CARRIE

   Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing ­ so hot and bright that it's impossible to
   see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder.

<b>226 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ CARRIE

<b>229 SUE IN THE WINGS
</b>
   The implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on
   her as everyone begins singing the school song:

                           ALL (o.s.)
                  All rise for the John F. Kennedy Hiyyyyh...

   And a hand comes into FRAME, clutching Sue's wrist. It belongs to:

<b>                        MORTON
</b>                  What're you doing here, young lady?

<b>                        SUE

   But Morton has no interest in what Sue is trying to tell him:

</b>                  I'll say there is.

<b>230 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ CARRIE'S POV
</b>
   From the throne, she sees Sue ­ and Morton and he pulls her toward the back exit.

   Chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>                  What's the matter with you? Pull it!

   Chris is frozen ­ immobilized, terrified.

<b>232 CARRIE'S POV ­ SUE
</b>
   As Morton firmly pushes Sue out the rear gym door. The door shuts, and as it closes:

<b>233 CARRIE
</b>
   Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise...
<b>                                                                                                108
</b>
<b>234 EXT. BACK OF GYM ­ SUE
</b>
   locked out by Morton, trying to get back in. The door won't open. She debates going to try
   another door.

<b>235 UNDER STAGE ­ CHRIS AND BILLY
</b>
   as the song reaches its crescendo:

                  It can stay there until hell freezes over, Chuckie.

   Chris shudders involuntarily at the mention of this nickname. She violently jerks the cord
   with both hands, yanking it. A sound ­ half-scream, half-moan ­ comes from her mouth,
   overlapping into:

<b>237 THE STEEL BUCKET
</b>
   high above the stage, slowly tipping over, the blood pouring from it.

<b>238 LONG SHOT ­ THE STAGE
</b>
   almost proscenium-like in this FRAMING, from all the way in the back of the gym.

   Carrie and Tommy sit on their huge thrones as the buckets above them deposit their contents
   on top of them.

   The blood splashing down...

<b>240 THE MURAL
</b>
   Some of it splattering on the celestial cyclorama, running downward, streaking...

   As more blood splatters them in their white dinner jackets, the MUSIC halting.

   Preparing to leave now that their mission has been accomplished, just about to crawl out as

   realizing they'll have to stay put ­ trapped now.

</b>
   As the singing stops, the students staring at the stage.

<b>246 CARRIE
</b>
   Her eyes tightly clenched shut, looking as if she's been dipped in a bucket of red paint. She's
   gotten the worst of it.

<b>247 THE BUCKET
</b>
   dangling on the pulleys over the throne, clanging back and forth. A high-pitched GIRL'S
<b>   VOICE SCREAMS.
</b>
<b>248 TOMMY
</b>
   Splattered with blood. Below them, the sounds of hysteria begin ("My God, that's blood!")
   Tommy starts toward Carrie just as:

    As the bucket falls and hits Tommy on the head; it knocks him unconscious, and he slumps to
    the floor.

<b> 250 THE STUDENTS ­ FEATURING HELEN SHYRES
</b>
    Watching this in pure horror. She starts to giggle uncontrollably, the kind of hysterical laugh
    that comes out of pure terror. It overlaps onto:

</b>
    As the hysteria begins to spread.

<b> 252 CARRIE

    as she starts toward the unconscious Tommy.

</b>
    hearing the dreaded laughter.

<b> 255 CARRIE'S POV ­ THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Through the harsh glare of the lights ­ laughing, pointing (see Norma Watson), doubling up in
    hysteria, utterly out of control.

    Laughing...

    reacting to their "success."

   As Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the black power cords. A horrified
   Collins is on her way up the stairs.

<b>                          COLLINS
</b>                   Oh, Carrie ­ let me help you.

   Carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher. But it's too late for help, and in the fastest flex
   we've seen to date, she jerks her head and Collins bounces backward ­ down the stairs,
   slamming into a wall.

<b>259 THE STUDENTS
</b>
   Laughing harder now, unable to stop.

<b>260 THE GYM ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   Where all is pandemonium.

   Morton makes his way to Collins, giving her his handkerchief; she has a bloody nose.

<b>                           COLLINS
</b>                           (to Morton)

<b>261 CARRIE
</b>
   Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her
   tormentors.

<b>262 THE GYM ­ YET ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
   Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock.

   George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy
   Ross, examining him.

<b>                           GEORGE
</b>                   Call a doctor! Hey, call a doctor, quick!

   He tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne topples over on the stage.

<b>263 INT. HALL CORRIDORS ­ SUE
</b>
   Frantic, rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors.

</b>
<b>264 CARRIE
</b>
   Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees:

<b>265 THE GYM DOORS ­ THREE SETS OF DOUBLE DOORS
</b>
   All of them open, a few students milling around them as...

<b>266 CARRIE
</b>
   Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes. And ­ in SWISH PANS:

<b>267 THE DOORS
</b>
   slam shut. In the process, several things are accomplished at once. The prom-goers are
   trapped inside, and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they
   close, screaming with surprise and pain.

<b>268 INT. HALL ­ SUE
</b>
   who once again was just a little late, arriving just as the DOORS SLAMMED SHUT; she sees
   the screaming prom-goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors.

<b>269 INT. GYM
</b>
   Utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors.

<b>270 THE BEAK
</b>
   Near the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and realizing that it's Carrie who's
   responsible for closing the doors.

<b>                          THE BEAK
</b>                  It's Carrie! It's Carrie!

   Fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone, to stop the panic.

   The kids continue rushing toward the closed doors.

<b>271 CARRIE
</b>
   A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power
   now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and
   never forget her.
<b>                                                                                              113

<b> 272 CARRIE'S POV ­ GYM WALL

    Between two sets of double-doors, FEATURING a huge firehouse installed in case of an
    emergency.

<b> 273 CARRIE
</b>
    Seeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here.

<b> 274 CLOSER
</b>
    as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it.

<b> 275 THE HOSE
</b>
    As it starts to unwind, to unspiral into the air, starting to spray a burst of water.

<b> 276 THE HOSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
    As it becomes snake-like, water springing from the nozzle.

<b> 277 THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes.

<b> 278 THE HOSE
</b>
    As the velocity of the water increases, stronger and stronger.

<b> 279 CARRIE
</b>
    Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys ­

<b> 280 THE STUDENTS
</b>
    Like rats in a maze ­ a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose. The
    water forces the students back from the doors, backwards toward the stage.

<b>280A CHRIS AND BILLY ­ UNDER THE STAGE
</b>
    As they see students propelled toward them by the hose.
<b>                                                                                               114
</b>
<b>281 CARRIE
</b>
   A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them ­ they're the ones being made
   to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage.

<b>283 ERNEST
</b>
   Level-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and
   the bandstand as fast as he can...

<b>284 CARRIE
</b>
   Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area.

<b>285 TRACKING ­ ERNEST
</b>
   knowing somehow ­ with some sixth sense ­ that Carrie's watching him. He feverishly
   hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in... where the high voltage
   cables are hooked up to the electrical current.

   Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard, telling everyone to
   remain calm.

<b>286 CARRIE
</b>
   Realizing just what Ernest plans to do:

<b>                          CARRIE
</b>                          (gently; determined)
                  No.

   And she mentally fixes on him, jerking her head just so... so ­

<b>287 ERNEST
</b>
   Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will.

<b>288 FROMM
</b>
   Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike. He puts his hand on it. The water, however, has
   reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted ­ his arm bursting into flame,
   unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on
   land.
<b>                                                                                                 115
</b>
<b>289 CARRIE
</b>
   Watching this; another flex, and:

<b>290 FROMM
</b>
   Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm
   igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students
   from using the back exit.

<b>291 THE STUDENTS
</b>
   Watching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc
   CRACKLES. Utter pandemonium.

<b>292 CARRIE
</b>
   Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding. She spots:

<b>293 THE LIGHTING T-BAR
</b>
   hanging over the bandstand.

<b>294 THE DOORS
</b>
   as the prom-goers press against the opaque glass, straining to get out. Fish in an aquarium.

<b>295 COLLINS
</b>
   moving toward the dazed Ernest, who's recuperating from his bout with Carrie.

<b>296 CARRIE
</b>
   her heart pounding like an anvil. She's staring at:

   She flexes.

</b>
<b>299 CEILING POV
</b>
   Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar. We see the flaming cyc on the
   stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS
   ­ just short of Collins' head ­ as far as its wires carry it.

<b>300 CARRIE
</b>
   Watching all this ­ a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her.

   Another flex.

<b>301 THE LIGHT BAR
</b>
   starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth ­ it hits the ceiling,
   igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling.

<b>302 BENEATH THE STAGE ­ CHRIS AND BILLY
</b>
   seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar.

   The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames
   prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see
   their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as:

<b>303 CARRIE
</b>
   Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late.
   They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.

<b>304 THE GYM ­ FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR
</b>
   As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her
   green chiffon dress back into a wall.

   Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical.

   Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on
   the windows so they can escape.

   Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this
   to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN.

   As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going

   Moving aside as Carrie walks through them ­ an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces.

   As Carrie makes it to one set of double doors, flexes them open, and exits.

<b>308 EXT. GYM ­ HALLWAY

   As Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of
   fire collapse behind her.

   She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this
   inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It

   Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly
   car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down
   a hill, and then, from:

   as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of
   nowhere, Billy's Chevy ­ it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her.

   Turns around and sees it coming toward her.

   Her head pounding, flexing.

<b>318 INT. CHEVY

   As Billy attempts to turn the wheel; it, too, has turned traitor ­ it won't turn.

   They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming
   as:

<b>319 THE CHEVY
</b>
   Plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. It then bursts into a sheet of
   flames.

   Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy,

   The house is totally dark. Not even a porch light. In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the
   burning gymnasium.

   A figure is moving toward the house.

   It is Carrie.

<b>322 AT DOOR
</b>
   Carrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it partially.

   Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs,
   goes along the narrow hallway to her room.

<b>324 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door.

   She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau.

   Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap.

   Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.

<b>325 INT. BATHROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot. It is almost steaming as she steps in.

   Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.

   Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the
   bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.

<b>326 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about
   her or perhaps she is emptied out.

   Carrie almost mouths:

<b>                       CARRIE
</b>                   Momma...

   It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.

   She goes out into the hallway.

<b>327 INT. HALLWAY ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths the words:
<b>                                                                                            121
</b>
<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                  Momma...

   Something ­ a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:

<b>328 MARGARET
</b>
   Coming toward her.

<b>329 CARRIE
</b>
   She flings out her arms and cries out:

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  Oh, Momma!

   And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick
   movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.

   Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.

   Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.

<b>330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS
</b>
   On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.

<b>331 MARGARET
</b>
   Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.

<b>   MARGARET
</b>   It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

<b>332 CARRIE
</b>
   Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl
   backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the
   stairs.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>                  And now the devil has come home.
<b>                                                                                                122
</b>
<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                      (whimpering)
                  Momma, it's not right.

   Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.

<b>333 INT. KITCHEN ­ NIGHT
</b>
   Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen,
   just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of
   the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while.

   Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.

   Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.

   Carrie flexes again ­ to hold the door shut.

   But it's no use ­ Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and
   starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>                  I should have killed you when you were born.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b>                  Momma, I love you. Please help me!

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>                  Sin never dies.

   There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork ­ dangling from a hook on
   the way ­ suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and
   another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.

   Margaret collapses.

   Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.

   And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling
   her screams.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                  You. You tricked me.
<b>                                                                                       123
</b>
<b>                        SUE
</b>                 No.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out.

<b>                       SUE
</b>                 We were just trying to...

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out.

And then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone.

Then another.

Then a third.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out! Get out!

The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.

Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.

<b>                        CARRIE
</b>                 Get out, get out, get out!

The stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof,
rattle on the floor below.

<b>                      CARRIE
</b><b>                 GET OUT!
</b>
A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen.

Carrie flexes.

And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door.

Flex.

Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.
<b>                                                                                                124
</b>
<b>333A EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Stones are crashing on the house.

     Sue is hurtled out of the house.

<b>  334 INT. KITCHEN
</b>
     As a couple of larger stones crash into the room, Carrie heads for the closet.

<b>  335 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house.

     She begins to run away.

<b>  336 INT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of Jesus is illuminated ­ welcoming her? She goes
     into the closet.

     She closes the door.

     Stones crash down, obliterating the scene.

<b>  337 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</b>
     Sue stops running. She turns to look at the White house.

<b>  338 WHITE HOUSE ­ SUE'S POV
</b>
     The stones are flattening the house. The house is being pounded into the ground.

<b>  339 SUE
</b>
     Terror and disbelief. Nightmare.

<b>  340 THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
     The rain of stones stops.

     Silence.

     Then the house begins to sink ­ slowly, slowly, slowly ­ into the ground.
<b>                                                                                                125
</b>
   And the ground is swallowing up the house.

   And covering it until ­ nothing remains. Not a trace.

<b>                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>341 EXT. SNELL HOUSE ­ DAY
</b>
   Some time later ­ a week, perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of Prom Night.

<b>342 INT. SNELL HOUSE
</b>
   A home in the course of losing its family. White sheets cover furniture. Boxes in the midst of
   being packed.

   Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She
   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she
   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They
   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.

   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first
   or second ring.

<b>                          ELEANOR
</b>                          (hushed voice)
                  Hello? Oh, thank God it's you, Betty. I don't think I could have
                  handled one more reporter.
                          (she appears to hear a noise upstairs)
                  Just a sec, dear.
                          (she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs)
                  Sue?
                          (a little louder)
                  Sue?
                          (no answer, she returns to the phone)
                  Sorry, Betty, I just wanted to make sure the phone didn't wake her.
                  We're all a bit edgy.
                          (beat)
                  Better. Sleeping too much, I guess, but Schneider says that's to be
                  expected after what she's gone through. He says she's young enough
                  to forget it in time. Knock wood.

   As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. Half of her
   is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good reason.
   Because:
<b>                                                                                               126
</b>
<b>343 EXT. EMPTY LOT ­ DAY
</b>
   Where the Horan house used to stand, now vacant. Strewn with beer cans, overgrown with
   grass and weeds and wildflowers. And a FOR SALE sign.

   We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand. It, too, is vacant but utterly
   bald ­ there's been no time for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put
   up by Born Realty.

<b>344 SUE SNELL
</b>
   looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring
   at the lot. She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.

<b>345 THE WHITE LOT ­ SUE'S POV
</b>
   as she slowly walks toward it. Underwater, almost floating. We come closer on the sign
   which now starts appearing a bit odder ­ less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a
   grave marker.

   And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk
   on the sign:

<b>                    CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING IN HELL FOR HER SINS
</b>
   And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:

<b>                                       JESUS NEVER FAILS
</b>
<b>346 SUE
</b>
   as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. She proceeds to try
   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.

   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second
   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.

   A bloody hand.

   A hand from the Earth itself.

   Carrie's hand

   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist. Tightly. A vice.
<b>                                                                                                127
</b>
   Sue begins screaming uncontrollably. The hand is trying to pull her into the ground. Her
   screams turn into howling.

<b>                                                                                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>347 SUE
</b>
   Still screaming. But now in her room, waking from what is, indeed, a bad nightmare.
   Upright in bed, screaming her head off, her face covered with perspiration.

   Eleanor Snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her hysterical daughter.

<b>                            ELEANOR
</b>                  It's all right, it's all right, darling.

<b>                        SUE
</b>                  Mother?

   And we come in close on Sue's stricken face as her mother holds her, calming her, cradling
   her. Closer still on Sue's eyes. She closes them, and we go to:

<b>                                                                                          BLACK
