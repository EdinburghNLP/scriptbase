July, 1995, the time is out of joint.
Two teen girls, Sam and Corey, have left Virginia for L.A. to start over.
Sam's brother has died and her family's shattered; Corey's too wild.
They have car trouble in a small desert town, where Corey immediately starts her partying ways, where a meteorite strikes a windmill, and where a burned-out Desert Storm vet predicts the end of the world in four days.
Sam hallucinates while sleepwalking, young men have disappeared from town, and cars come out of nowhere to cause accidents.
Time travel may be possible, but it takes courage and resolve.
Is the addled war veteran right?
If he is, can Corey or Sam make things right?
