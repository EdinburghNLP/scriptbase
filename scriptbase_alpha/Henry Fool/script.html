</b>


                                       Written by

                                       Hal Hartley



<b>                                     SHOOTING DRAFT
</b>
<b>                
</b>
<b>               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY
</b>
               A garbage truck roars by and...

               Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny 
               and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old.

               The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to 
               go punch out at the time clock.

<b>               EXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer.

               He begins to relax. This is his quality private time.

               Then he hears something and looks up.

               He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances 
               and sees...

               Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having 
               sex.

               Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                              (to Amy)
                         You want some?

               Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up.

               Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as...

               Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The 
               boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt.

               Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast 
               is clear, then returns just in time to see...

               Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her.

               The pipe falls from the young girl's hand.

               Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her.

               Simon's mouth falls open in awe.

               But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees...

               The amazed garbage man; caught.

               Amy starts screaming insanely.

               Simon runs for his life.

               Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase 
               him away.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands 
               there in the doorway catching his breath.

               His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small 
               portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away 
               in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different 
               channel.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                              (to Simon)
                         Where the hell have you been?
                              (to Mary)
                         Mom, come on and eat.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         I'm not hungry.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                              (pissed)
                         Then why'd I cook!

               Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in 
               the evening.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         I don't know why you cooked! I don't 
                         know why you bother!

               Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her 
               brother.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Sit down and eat, Simon.

               Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl 
               of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. 
               Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay 
               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the 
               bowl and eats some more.

               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container 
               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.

               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the 
               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of 
               cheese roll out.

               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach 
               while...

               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.

<b>               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. 
               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach 
               and spits, sickened.

               He looks up, though, and sees...

               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing 
               there in the street watching him.

               Simon tries to smile at her.

               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.

               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering 
               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, 
               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.

               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting 
               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         God, I wanna get fucked.

               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         You OK?

               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks 
               back at his sister.

               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         See ya later.

               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he 
               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks 
               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.

               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a 
               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.

               Titles begin.

               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, 
               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, 
               he focuses on...

               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.

               Music starts.

               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the 
               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on 
               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of 
               the music over the scene.

               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...

               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...

               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.

               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens 
               his eyes and sees...

               A man approaching. The music swells up full.

               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in 
               wonder at...

               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak 
               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a 
               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled 
               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.

               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.

               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.

               Titles finish.

               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the 
               house.

               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood 
               and then down at Simon.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Get up off your knees.

               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off 
               towards his new home.

<b>               EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
               Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to 
               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying 
               the suitcases.

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw 
               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.

               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the 
               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair 
               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.

               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually 
               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.

<b>               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which 
               to eat donuts.

               Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the 
               Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the 
               safety of the counter.

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         Say something.

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                              (calling)
                         She's mute.

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         What?

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                         She don't -- you know -- talk.

               Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's 
               gaze to the door.

               Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his 
               tracks when he sees...

               Warren and Amy.

               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.

               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple 
               of vampires.

               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the 
               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.

               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...

               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.

               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, 
               but...

               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.

               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at 
               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down 
               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering 
               back over her shoulder, she hisses...

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         Kiss my ass.

               Simon is nonplussed.

               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...

               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.

               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's 
               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and 
               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.

               But then... Simon throws up all over her.

               Warren falls back in disgust.

               Gnoc covers her face with her hands.

               Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming 
               bloody murder.

               Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as 
               Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down 
               around her ankles.

               Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door 
               holding a shovel and ready to fight.

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                              (scared)
                         Oh, shit!

               Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the 
               store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws 
               open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating 
               delinquents...

<b>                                     MR DENG
</b>                              (in Vietnamese)
                         Stay the hell out of my store, you 
                         good-for-nothing punks!

               Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming 
               at Simon.

<b>                                     MR DENG
</b>                         Look at this! What's going on here? 
                         Simon, get up off the floor! Is this 
                         beer paid for?

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</b>
               Later.

               Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then 
               watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled 
               with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the 
               mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling 
               and bright.

               Simon steps over and looks at...

               The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (off-screen)
                         Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the 
                         end.

               Simon looks over and sees...

               Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into 
               the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. 
               He hands one to Simon.

               Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his 
               eyes to Henry.

<b>                                     SIMON

</b>                         Nowhere in particular.

               He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely 
               impressed with himself.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I go where I will and I do what I 
                         must.
                              (stops, drinks)
                         That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've 
                         what you might call... 'in exile'.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Why are you in trouble?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (stopping)
                         An honest man is always in trouble, 
                         Simon. Remember that.

               Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry 
               stands in a dim corner across the room.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         How do you know my name?

               Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. 
               He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts 
               his finger and points to...

               Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt.

               Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks.

               Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his 
               shoulder, laughing mischievously.

<b>                                     SIMON

<b>                                     HENRY

                         Well... I'll take your word for that.

                         People. I mean. They think. You know. 
                         Because.

               He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up 
               gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves 
               into a dumb stare into empty space.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I see.

               Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from 
               off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves 
               them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to 
               Simon.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Here. Take this. And...

               He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         ...this. Keep them with you at all 
                         times. You ever feel like you got 
                         something to say and you can't get 
                         it out, stop and write it down. OK?

               Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for 
               another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of 
               notebooks on the mantelpiece.

                         What have you done?

               Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.

                         exploits are only a pretext for a 
                         far more expansive consideration of 
                         general truths.

                         poetics. A politics, if you will. A 
                         literature of protest. A novel of 
                         ideas. A pornographic magazine of 
                         truly comic-book proportions. It is, 
                         in the end, whatever the hell I want 
                         it to be. And when I'm through with

               He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash 
               outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're 
               throwing bottles at the house.

               Simon jumps up.

               Henry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down.

               He is ashamed of himself.

               Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend 
               with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He 
               lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close

                         Because it's the only thing I have

               Henry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is 
               riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat...

               Simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex 
               from his sister's room. He stands outside her door and 
               listens.

               Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, 
               sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking. He approaches and

                              room)
                         She's got some ex-con in there she 
                         met at the bar. Tattoos all over

               Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away.

               Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He 
               runs a glass of water and brings it in to her.

               She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.

               She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.

</b>                         What's the use? She might as well 
                         get it while she can. She's not always 
                         gunna have the ass she has now, you 
                         know. That's just how life is.

               She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. 
               Simon stands there in the dark.

</b>
               Moments later.

               Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits 
               at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and 
               stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry 
               gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then 
               he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his 
               head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down 
               into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil.

               He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. 
               Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. 
               Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's 
               dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins 
               writing in a slow, laborious hand.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY
</b>
               The next morning.

               Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee 
               and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits 
               asleep over his notebook at the table.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         lend me twenty dollars?

               Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and 
               reaches for his wallet.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Thanks. Where's the library in the

                         Down the highway about a mile and a 
                         half and then make a left.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         chapters of my 'Confession' and I 
                         need a reasonably well-stocked 
                         reference section.

               He lifts up Simon's notebook.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         What's this?

               Simon hesitates, shyly.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. 
                         Maybe.

               He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through 
               the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every 
               page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, 
               intrigued. Then...

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Can I take this?

               Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I'll correct the spelling.

<b>               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY
</b>
               Later that day.

               Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing 
               garbage.

<b>               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               That evening.

               Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of 
               soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and 
               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside 
               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture 
               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the 
               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and 
               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit 
               it back into the book.

               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites 
               his lip and tries again.

               He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and 
               looks back over his shoulder to see...

               Amy throws a bottle at his head.

               Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his 
               neck.

               Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out 
               of the puddle and smacking him in the head.

               Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which 
               she sets aflame with her lighter.

               Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the 
               ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.

               Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.

               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, 
               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.

               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the 
               rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming 
               torch in his face.

<b>                                     SIMON

                         One of you is gunna lose an eye.

               Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself 
               to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving 
               the torch deliriously above his head.

<b>                                     SIMON

                         One of you is gunna lose an eye!

               Warren stops.

               Amy steps back and lowers the gas can.

               Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses 
               and continues...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         One of you. I promise.

               Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which 
               is too hot to handle. He drops it.

               Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused.

               Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his 
               hands and stares straight at Warren.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         You can set me on fire. But one of 
                         you is gunna have an eye torn out of 
                         your head. I promise.

               Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps 
               back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks 
               away.

               Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.

               He hangs there still, glaring at him.

               Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. 
               Amy looks ill.

<b>                                     WARREN

               Henry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in 
               Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees...

               Simon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics 
               to the floor. Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (scared)
                         Simon! Who did this to you?

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I was gunna tear out their eyes. I 
                         knew I could do it.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Whose eyes?

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I told them. Like you said. I told 
                         them. And I knew I could do it.

               He passes out. Henry looks at Mr Deng.

<b>                                     MR DENG
</b>                         You should take him home. He smells 
                         like a toilet.

               Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr 
               Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out 
               into the parking lot.

               Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and 
               places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits 
               open on the table. She looks at it, then reads. She lifts it 
               off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply 
               engrossed.

               Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back 
               into the store and stops, startled, when he sees...

               Gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook 
               open in her hands before her, singing quietly.

               Twenty minutes later.

               Fay is in the bathroom helping Simon out of his clothes, 
               trying to clean his wounds.

<b>                                     FAY

</b>                         Oh, shut up! Turn around.

               Henry is at the kitchen table with Mary. She watches him 
               suspiciously. He lets her.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         This kinda thing has happened before.

                         It won't happen again.

               She watches him as he walks around the room, browsing.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         How do you know?

               He stops and lifts a small framed photo of a soldier off the 
               piano.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         This your husband?

               Violated somehow, she gets up and snatches it out of his 
               hands. She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry plays 
               one note on the piano.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         Stop that.

               He fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her 
               to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck. She 
               steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door. They 
               look over to see...

               Mr Deng enter with the notebook.

               Henry comes over, takes the notebook from him and shoves it 
               in his pocket.

               Simon reaches out and slams the bathroom door.

               Fay looks from the bathroom door down the stairs to Mary. 
               Mary, her nerves rattled, glances over at Mr Deng, who turns 
               and leaves the house.

               Henry lights a fresh cigarette, loosens his tie and heads 
               upstairs.

               A moment later.

               Henry throws open the door and enters. He steps over Simon, 
               who is on the floor, folded up against the toilet.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         We gotta talk.

               Henry sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes the notebook 
               from his pocket.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         What the hell were you trying to do 
                         when you wrote this thing?

               Simon just looks at him, not certain what he means.

</b>                         Nothing.

</b>                         Well, you know you wrote it in a 
                         kind of iambic pentameter.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Verse.

               He scratches his chin and smokes.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Look, in my opinion, this is pretty 
                         powerful stuff. Though your spelling 
                         is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a 
                         little naive, your instincts are 
                         profound. But the whole thing needs 
                         to be given a more cohesive shape. 
                         It can be expanded. Followed through. 
                         Unified.
                              (smokes, then)
                         You see what I'm getting at?

               Simon just stares at him, overwhelmed. Henry drops the 
               notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Are you willing to commit yourself 
                         to this? To really work on it? To 
                         give it its due? In the face of 
                         adversity and discouragement? To 
                         rise to the challenge you yourself 
                         have set?

               Simon just blinks, looks away and wonders.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         And don't gimme that wonderstruck 
                         'I'm-only-a-humble-garbage-man'

                         Of course it does.

               Simon coughs and Henry leans back and smokes.

               An hour later.

               Fay cringes outside Simon's room as Henry goes about setting 
               her brother's arm.

</b>                         Yes. Now shut up and lie back.

               Simon does.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Is this gunna hurt?

</b>                         Yes.

               He pauses, then leans back.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         You gunna be alright?

               Simon nods and stares at the ceiling. Henry hands him a towel.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Here. Bite on this.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                              (spots blood on it)
                         What's that?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (looking)
                         It's blood. From your head. Lie back. 
                         Shove that in your mouth and hold on 
                         to something.

               Simon bites down on the towel and grips the edge of the bed 
               with his free hand. Henry sits on his legs and gently raises 
               the broken arm.

               Outside the door, Fay bites her knuckles. Further down the 
               hall, Mary listens from her bedroom.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Okay. You ready?

               Simon nods. Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces 
               himself. Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Aaagghhh!!!!!!!

               Fay turns and runs down the stairs. Mary backs away into her 
               room and shuts the door.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</b>
               Later that night.

               Henry comes downstairs and stops, tired. Fay is sitting at 
               the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses. She has dolled 
               herself up a little and Henry likes what he sees. He looks 
               her over and she smiles. He sits. She pours. They drink.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         So, do you have, like, you know, a 
                         girlfriend, Henry?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         No.

               They drink again in silence. He lights her cigarette and 
               they watch each other closely. Finally, Fay leans on the 
               table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers.

<b>                                     FAY

<b>                                     HENRY

                         like twenty, or... you know, thirty?

               He drinks and studies her. She presents her profile. Finally, 
               he leans back.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Thirty.

               Fay jumps up, furious.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Listen, you geek, after a couple of 
                         drinks plenty of people mistake me 
                         for eighteen!

               She grabs her bag and storms out of the house. Henry watches 
               her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another 
               drink.

               Next morning.

               A thirty-year-old cocktail waitress named Vicky walks up and 
               stops when she sees...

               Warren, sitting back against the side of World of Donuts, 
               smoking a joint and thinking about his future.

               She sighs and approaches.

               Unruffled, she hands him a flyer.

                         for our country.

               He tokes deeply, then...

                         to our way of life.

               Warren looks over the flyer, then reconsiders Vicky.

                         later?

               Vicky sighs, troubled. She adjusts her waitress uniform and 
               looks mildly offended.

               Vicky is hard-pressed. She wants to believe him, but knows 
               better. She thinks about it while...

               Henry passes by and approaches the store.

<b>               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry enters and takes Simon's notebook from his pocket. He 
               flips through a few pages and selects one in particular.

               He tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the 
               register so customers can read it. He winks at Gnoc. She 
               smiles shyly and makes him a coffee. He takes it and moves 
               off to a table just as...

               Vicky enters. She starts accumulating groceries, placing 
               them on the counter one item at a time.

               Henry settles down and watches as...

               Vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice 
               and notices the poem. She reads, holding the orange juice 
               out to her side.

               Gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father 
               comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of 
               the cigarettes.

               Vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified 
               expression clouding her face. Finally...

               Smash!!!! She drops the bottle of orange juice and stands 
               back. Mr Deng and Gnoc jump back, alarmed.

               Henry tilts his head and pays close attention.

               Mr Deng looks from her to the poem and then over at Henry. 
               Henry urges the man to stand up for himself.

                         there, Mr Deng?

               Mr Deng has no idea. He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out 
               from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess.

               Later.

               Henry is at the kitchen table with Simon, working on the 
               poem. Simon is bandaged up, his arm in a sling, black eyes, 
               etc.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         See, Simon, there are three kinds of 
                         there. There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. 
                         There are the donuts. Then there's T-
                         H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It 
                         is their donut. Then, finally, there's 
                         'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A 
                         contraction, meaning they are. They're 
                         the donut people. Get it?

</b>                         Uh-huh.

               Henry lifts up one of Simon's newly acquired classics...

                         up-to-date edition. This odoriferous

                         Commentary. I'll go to the library 
                         and find you the best edition they 
                         have.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Thank you, but that's OK. I'll stop 
                         there on my way back from work. Well, 
                         yes, maybe not today, but, you know,

</b>                         Why?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         You need time to write, Simon. To 
                         study. To reflect.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         But I like my job.

</b>                         We all have to make sacrifices. A 
                         vocation like ours, Simon, is not a 
                         nine to five thing. You can't put a 
                         fence around a man's soul. We think 
                         and feel where and when we can think 
                         and feel. We are the servants of our 
                         muse and we toil where she commands.

               Simon looks past him and Henry follows his gaze to find...

               Mary standing at the foot of the stairs, listening to them. 
               She says nothing. She looks Henry up and down, then shakes 
               her head disdainfully and grunts. She throws herself on the 
               couch and turns on the TV, casting acid glances over at the 
               kitchen.

<b>               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               Henry and Simon come outside...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         She's clinically depressed.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         I guess it means it's not her fault.

               Henry wanders out to the road, checking his wallet, then...

<b>                                     HENRY

                         Where ever.

               Simon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods.

<b>                                     SIMON

</b>                         No. I found it in a fortune cookie.

               He pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of 
               his pockets and shows it to Simon.

<b>                                     SIMON

</b>                              (puffing himself up)
                         Well, you know, Simon, a piece of 
                         work like this, it's... A vocation 
                         like ours... You can't put a fence 
                         around a man's soul. What I'm trying 
                         to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a 
                         lifetime really. It's a life's work.
                              (looking around)
                         But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate 
                         your feedback. I gotta go. See ya.

               He hurries away around the corner. Simon walks back to the 
               house and stops when he sees...

               A plain-clothes policeman, Officer Buñuel, drive up and park 
               before the house.

               Simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on 
               Henry's door. He, of course, gets no answer.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY
</b>
               Later that day.

               Simon works on his poem at the kitchen table while Fay flips 
               through a magazine and watches TV. Mary, lying on the couch 
               in her bathrobe, watches her own TV.

               The cacophony is augmented by the rattling dishwasher and 
               the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside.

               Mary looks over at her son, suspicious, and leans off the 
               couch.

<b>                                     MARY
</b>                         What are you doing there, Simon?

               He carefully finishes writing a word, then looks up and 
               pauses.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I'm writing a poem.

               Mary looks at Fay, who looks up from her magazine and 
               considers her brother. Then they break out laughing.

               Simon looks on.

               They laugh and laugh and laugh...

<b>               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Later.

               Simon is bent over his notebook, consulting a dictionary, 
               hard at work.

               Amy and three kids are grouped around the register, reading 
               the page Henry taped up earlier. As they read, Amy glances 
               anxiously back at Simon.

               They finish reading and stand back.

               Amy nods 'Yes', then leads them towards Simon.

               Simon scribbles away.

               He looks up, sees her, panics and slides away on the seat. 
               Amy looks down and bites her lip, contrite. She sighs.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               That evening.

               Fay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair. She 
               switches on the TV and looks for cigarettes. She finds Mary's 
               pills on the table and remembers to ask...

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Ma, you take your medication?

               Mary is lying on the couch. She drags her eyes from the TV 
               and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the TV.

<b>                                     FAY

                         Guess so.

               She sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine.

               Henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library 
               books. His eyes brighten when he sees...

               Fay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She 
               looks back over her shoulder and sees him.

<b>                                     HENRY

</b>                              (disdainfully)
                         What do you want?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I've got these books for Simon.

               She turns away.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Well, leave 'em there on the counter, 
                         then.

               He comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends 
               to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair 
               anyway, to show more shoulder.

               This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against 
               the counter, salivating.

               Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and 
               leans against the fridge.

               She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her 
               attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows 
               his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears 
               from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, 
               waits, wonders...

               He leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks 
               at her, then down to...

               Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His 
               hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things.

               Her mouth drops open.

               He looks back up at her. He grins.

               Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around 
               herself.

               Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out 
               of his face and shivers with lust.

               Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, 
               making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride.

               Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs.

               He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze.

               She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs 
               defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar.

               Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, 
               grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a 
               step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch 
               and sees...

               Mary, lying there, sedately amazed.

               He pauses, then grins.

               Mary blinks and smiles sleepily.

               Simon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck. Putting 
               down his pencil, he looks up and sees...

               Warren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler. Seeing 
               Simon, he waves and approaches.

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                         Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?

               Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him 
               a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to 
               consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America 
               to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; 
               to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race 
               to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! 
               He's a good man.

               He steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng 
               glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out 
               and snarls at the old man...

               He leaves. Simon looks down and studies the flyer.

               Fay lies across her bed in her towel, holding a pose and 
               glancing anxiously back at the door. Finally, losing her 
               patience, she gets up.

               She opens the door and looks out into the hall.

               He's not there.

               She steps out into the hall and listens.

               Nothing. She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint 
               activity from down below. She proceeds downstairs.

               She sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living-
               room and stops. She goes white, her mouth falling open in 
               horror.

               Henry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch. Sloppy, 
               impassioned, brute sex.

               They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. Mary 
               clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee 
               table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers.

               Fay is crushed. She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs.

               Henry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, 
               uncertain and confused.

               Simon is asleep with his head down on the table. He wakes 
               finally and sees...

               Henry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading 
               the poem. He finishes, shuts the book and drinks.

                         Angus James. Smart, adventurous and

                         it. He'll respect my opinion.

               Simon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds 
               carefully.

               Henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. Jumping 
               to his feet, he paces maniacally.

               A customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves.

               Some kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around 
               and asks...

               He drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon.

                         world can't handle that. Our mere 
                         existence is a threat to its illusion 
                         of security. Sure, they'll name a

               He drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over 
               at Tim who is still looking on.

               Tim hesitates, but then obeys. He gets up and leaves. Henry 
               returns to Simon.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         For example, I made love to your

                         it wasn't such a good idea.

               Simon blinks. Henry adds...

               Simon is deeply confused. He looks ill. He stands and takes 
               a few steps away, staring at the floor.

               Simon stops and looks at him.

               Simon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops.

               Henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the 
               top of his voice.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         you need experience. You need to do 
                         something to be ashamed of every 
                         once in a while, for cryin' out loud.

               He walks to the door.

               He strides out of the store.

               Simon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old 
               man wipes off the table with a wet rag.

               Henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk 
               topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers 
               them on.

               Simon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white 
               knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as...

               Simon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing...

               Mary, sitting on the top step, smoking. She looks guilty and 
               tense. So does Simon.

               Simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when 
               he sees...

               Fay, passed out drunk on her bed. Her clothes are half off 
               and her lipstick smeared. She still grips a bottle of tequila 
               in her hand.

               Simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. He 
               gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed.

               Her bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself 
               staring at her thigh.

               He reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked-
               up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. He catches himself, 
               snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket.

               He flees.

               at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful 
               position and begins to read.

               Henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its 
               various accessories and a couple of coffees.

               He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes.

               Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his 
               red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem.

               Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table. 
               Seeing the computer...

               And he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon

               Moments later.

               They scramble in and Henry is out of breath. He slumps down 
               into a pew.

               He pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. Simon looks on, 
               baffled. He comes closer.

               He hears something, stands and moves further into the church. 
               Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. 
               Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find...

               A young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks 
               up from his quiet sobbing and sees...

               Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed 
               distaste. He lowers his head in shame. Henry moves closer 
               and sits beside the distraught priest.

                         Listen, father, as I was about to 
                         tell my friend Simon here, I am, 
                         without doubt, the biggest sinner

                         But still, I've gotta stay up late 
                         at night to outdo the unending parade 
                         of mundane little atrocities I see 
                         committed every day right out in the

                         I insist your vocation makes a 
                         difference, because to hold out 
                         anything other than a spiritual

                         poet, or something.

               Simon doesn't corroborate this. He looks away and readjusts 
               his sling. Buñuel scratches his head, satisfied and prepares 
               to leave. But first...

               Simon shrugs.

               Buñuel waits a moment, then steps away and gets back in his 
               car. Simon watches as the parole officer drives away and 
               passes...

               They wait as the child goes outside.

               Mary listens, unseen, from her bedroom door.

               Fay comes over and frowns at her brother. She's about to 
               lecture him, but he cuts her off.

               Fay steps back, startled. Simon stands, but can't decide 
               which way to go. He sits back down.

               Mary turns away from her door and sits on her bed.

               Fay leans over the stove, where a large pot of water is 
               beginning to boil.

               Fay's mouth falls open and she staggers back, hurt.

               Simon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared. But 
               Fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him, splashing 
               boiling water all over his back.

               Outside, Pearl turns and looks back at the house.

               Simon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen. Fay falls 
               back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into 
               her hands.

               Fay is crouched on the floor, sobbing, while Simon lies in a 
               tub of cold water. Mary comes in with a pathetic little 
               freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub.

               She steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down 
               the stairs. She glares back at Fay, who cries even louder as 
               Simon stares up at the ceiling.

               Mary shakes her head and walks into her room, slamming the 
               door behind her.

               Simon has no answers. But he reaches out and touches his

               Simon comes limping in, all stiff because of his scalded 
               back. He's not familiar with the library, so he stands looking 
               around, trying to figure it out.

               He wanders into an aisle, overwhelmed by all the books. Coming 
               to the far end of the aisle, he looks off to his left and 
               sees Henry sitting on a small stool, reading, with ten or 
               twenty open volumes scattered around him on the floor.

               Deeply hurt, he simply turns to walk away. But Henry reaches 
               out and grabs his arm. Simon stops, pauses and looks back at

               A young woman passes by, scanning the stacks. She and Henry 
               have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves 
               away. Henry straightens his tie and watches her go.

               cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, 
               slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go 
               and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of

               He comes out from the stacks, working his way through the 
               first page of Paradise Lost. He nearly bumps into a girl and 
               they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze 
               for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and 
               stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page.

               After a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at...

               Another girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up 
               from her reading and returns his gaze.

               He smiles at her.

               She gets up and leaves.

               Simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes 
               out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees 
               instead...

               A third girl sitting at another table, listening to her 
               Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer.

               He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to 
               his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at 
               her.

               With a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook...

                         ever feel stupid?

               He looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their 
               eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down.

                         How is this possible? Ask Henry.

               He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, 
               then stops and looks back over at the girl.

               and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in 
               her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset 
               with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before 
               her, then turns and walks quickly away.

               The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and 
               reads...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                              (voice-over)
                         Why do I do this to myself? And why 
                         do I reduce you to only one 
                         possibility? These are not even 
                         questions anymore. I know the answers 
                         myself. This isn't a page of notes. 
                         It's a letter. A letter to you. A 
                         desperate act. You are a miracle to 
                         me. I can't breathe.

               By now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes 
               reading the letter and looks around in astonishment.

               Evening.

               Henry enters and sits with Buñuel.

               Henry just glares at him and smokes.

               Buñuel looks down, disappointed.

                         think it'd be right to have you at

                         on the kids.

               Henry sits back, offended.

</b>                         So my word is not enough. My promise 
                         worthless. The fact I've served my 
                         time nothing but the emblem of my 
                         continuing guilt.

               Henry leans back and sighs, furious and indignant.

               She shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he backs 
               away in disgust.

               Simon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the fridge.

                         supposed to be a small, delicate 
                         kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle.

                         telephone book.

               He places the notebooks on the table and leaves the house. 
               Fay clears the computer screen, pulls the notebooks closer 
               and gets down to work.

               Moments later.

               Simon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting in 
               front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding darkly.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I was caught. Yes, I was caught... 
                         once. I was caught in flagranti 
                         delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old 
                         girl named Susan. She was an ugly 
                         and mean-spirited kid, but she knew 
                         how to play upon my weaknesses which, 
                         I admit, are deep and many.

               He drinks, then looks at Simon and adds...

                         Sorry.

               Henry stands and leans over the fire.

</b>                         It was a pathetic little conspiracy. 
                         A transparently desperate attempt to 
                         discredit me and my ideas; to label 
                         me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be 
                         ashamed of such a thing. As if 
                         Socrates himself hadn't been taken 
                         out of circulation for corrupting 
                         the youth of Athens!

               He comes over and takes a beer. He strides around the room, 
               thinking, reflecting.

</b>                         Seven years. Seven years for one 
                         afternoon of blissful transgression. 
                         But what of it? Who cares? Prison's 
                         not so bad; particularly if one's a 
                         sex offender, free from the popular 
                         and conventional horror of sodomy.

               Stops, drinks declares...

</b>                         They were not 'lost years'.

               He approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece.

               He glances over at Simon, who sits gripping his beer, 
               watching, rapt.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         insignificance in the wider context 
                         of my career.

               He pauses and swills back some beer. He brightens up, gets 
               excited...

                              (beginning to pace)
                         What an orgy we'll have then, huh? 
                         What shouts of outrage from the 
                         offended populace, from the 
                         sanctimonious purveyors of culture 
                         and quality, the righteous defenders 
                         of what ever inane and haphazard 
                         notion of progress then in vogue. 
                         They'll be beside themselves with 
                         fiercely reasoned critical analysis. 
                         Apoplectic with indignation!

               Drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm.

               He smashes the bottle in the fireplace.

</b>                         Yes, like a mirror which reflects

                         it, my 'Confession' will lovingly 
                         render humanity's common monstrosity 
                         in all of its lurid wide screen glory.

               He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         before the common lot of humanity, 
                         anyway, for a few banal and, again I 
                         admit, inelegant transgressions?

               He drinks, sighs and sits back down.

                         civilization a favor.

               Simon sits back in awe. He waits a moment and thinks. Finally 
               he stands and approaches the 'Confession'. He reaches out 
               and drags his hand across the notebooks.

               Simon and Father Hawkes are deep in conversation.

</b>                         We are told not to judge. But to 
                         forgive. Not to look into our 
                         neighbor's eye to find the bad, but 
                         to find the good.
                              (pacing)
                         Now this is difficult. I admit.
                              (pause)
                         But having a good friend is not always 
                         easy.

               Simon listens and carefully considers all the priest says.

               Father Hawkes pauses, then comes closer and sits.

                         learn. I've seen this. Let yourself 
                         be taught. Show your appreciation 
                         for his guidance. In this way, you 
                         know, perhaps. Well. There's hope

               Fay comes walking up through the parking lot with Simon's 
               notebooks and a pile of typed papers. She's a wreck; tear-
               stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like 
               a weapon. She throws open the door to the World of Donuts 
               and looks around.

               The place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it 
               was a café or student union.

               Fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter.

                         of the verse recalls, for me, Walt

               forth to his friend and the small coterie of high school

</b>                         The greats all say the same thing: 
                         little. And what little there is to 
                         be said is immense. Or, in other 
                         words, follow your own genius to 
                         where it leads without regard for 
                         the apparent needs of the world at 
                         large, which, in fact, has no needs 
                         as such, but, rather, moments of 
                         exhaustion in which it is incapable 
                         of prejudice.

</b>                         Can you sit there, look me straight 
                         in the eye, and tell me you don't 
                         think this poem is great? That it is 
                         not at once a work of great lyrical 
                         beauty and ethical depth? That it is 
                         not a genuine, highly individual, 
                         and profound meditation on the miracle 
                         of existence?

               Simon holds the stare, overwhelmed.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I, ah...

               Simon looks away, thinks a moment, then looks back at Henry.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         No. I can't.

</b>                         So, you see, you have no choice!

               He goes back into the bathroom. Simon thinks a while, then...

               Still no response. Simon gets up and stands in the bathroom 
               doorway. Henry is shaving.

                         might not carry as much weight as it 
                         once did with Angus.

</b>                         You said he respected your opinion.

               Henry puts down his razor and looks at Simon in the mirror.

               He sees Simon looks worried.

</b>                         To be honest; my ideas, my writing, 
                         they haven't always been received 
                         well or even calmly. They're 
                         upsetting. I'm a controversial man.

               He walks around the bathroom, gesticulating.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         You see, what I'm doing is too 
                         radical. Too uncompromising. It'll 
                         take time for people to see its value. 
                         It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or 
                         maybe just...
                              (stops)
                         A recommendation from me might do 
                         you as much harm as it does good.

               Simon patiently absorbs all this, then walks through the 
               kitchen and looks across at the 'Confession' notebooks.

<b>                                     SIMON

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY
</b>
               Mary is sitting, brooding in front of the TV, which displays 
               only static white noise. She turns it off with the remote 
               and sits in silence for a moment.

               She gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where 
               Fay's computer sits. She goes over and reaches up above the 
               fridge, opening the cabinet containing Simon's notebooks.

               She hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her 
               hands, as if to begin reading. But then she puts them back.

               She walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, 
               before slowly sitting down and opening it. She lifts her 
               hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making 
               sure no one is there.

               But, finally, she turns back and begins playing.

               She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with rusty 
               accomplishment. At one time she was probably quite good.

               She plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved 
               by the music. But then she stops, pauses, and looks behind 
               her.

               Simon is standing in the kitchen. He has been deeply affected 
               by her playing.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Please don't stop.

               She stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and 
               closes the piano. She returns to the couch and switches on 
               the TV.

               Simon comes closer. He sits.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         That was nice what you were playing.

</b>                         Yes, it was nice. But it was 
                         unremarkable.

               Simon waits. Eventually...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Does that matter?

                         Yes. It does.

               She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. She slams her 
               bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch. He thinks. 
               Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen.

               He takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet 
               above the refrigerator and goes to the door. He pauses, 
               clutches the poem and goes out.

<b>               EXT. SUBWAY STATION -- DAY

               Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls 
               into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on.

</b>                         Simon?

               No answer. She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes 
               down Simon's notebook. But doesn't. She grabs her pills and 
               is about to take them. But then she stops. She puts them 
               down and goes to the cabinet. She takes down Simon's notebooks 
               and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and 
               begins to read.

               area of James Midriff and Sutton Publishing. He walks 
               hesitantly up to the receptionist, a bright and spirited

                         wound-up young garbage man out here 
                         who seems to have written a poem. A 
                         long poem. And I recall how, at last 
                         month's meeting, you stressed the 
                         need for us to be on the look-out 
                         for more marginalized verse from 
                         unestablished quarters of the American 
                         scene.

               Angus comes out to the water cooler and glares at Simon as 
               he gets a drink.

               pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in 
               concentration, he dictates to Amy, who is sitting at a table 
               with her laptop computer, typing his every word.

                         love, God wants to create the largest

                         possible world and creates it. Fine. 
                         This 'decision' by God is uncontingent 
                         and eternal rather than temporally

               He smokes, drinks, paces some more. Amy waits with bated 
               breath, devastated by his obscure profundity. He comes back 
               and sits beside her, reaching his conclusion.

               Henry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently. She leans 
               over close and whispers in his ear. He turns and looks at 
               her, alarmed.

               Henry jumps up and looks around, paranoid. He keeps his voice 
               down and points at her.

               She just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries to 
               imagine this. She takes her laptop and leaves, confused and 
               blushing.

               Henry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself.

</b>                         This is really quite unbelievably 
                         bad, my friend. I mean, I'm all for 
                         experimentation and I've made a career 
                         out of a healthy disregard for 
                         convention, but... Look, this is 
                         profoundly irrelevant material. This 
                         is only my opinion. But it's an 
                         opinion I value highly. Goodnight, 
                         Laura. Call Norton Press. We're still 
                         on for tomorrow.

               Simon looks pale as Angus strides towards the elevator.

</b>                         I've been wrong before as a publisher. 
                         But I refuse to admit I've ever been 
                         wrong as a reader. You have talent, 
                         I admit. You have an innate sense of 
                         the musicality of language. A good 
                         ear, maybe. But you do nothing 
                         significant with it. And this twisted 
                         reasoning that poses as... conviction 
                         or insight, it's... well, it's 
                         embarrassing.

               They reach the elevator and stop. Simon tries to catch his 
               breath.

                         A friend of mine spoke of you. He 
                         said you had a lot of integrity.

</b>                         Yes, well, of course, I do. But I'm 
                         not crazy, am I? Who is this person? 
                         Do I know him?

               Simon hesitates, almost decides against it, but then...

               Angus looks back at him.

               Simon waits.

               Angus looks aside, thinks, then shakes his head.

</b>                         Never heard of him.

               Simon just looks at him blankly, confused.

               The doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator. He's 
               gone. Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet. He 
               is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath.

               His poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor.

                         I remember Henry.

               Simon doesn't register this right away. But then he looks up 
               and over at the receptionist.

               Laura stands and comes around her desk. She pauses, seeing 
               his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem. 
               Handing it to him, she explains...

               He just stares at her, demolished.

               Later.

               Simon dumps his poem in a trash can, pauses, then enters the 
               subway.

               Henry is leaning on the counter, flipping through pornographic 
               magazines and smoking.

               Henry flips through pages and nods, impressed.

               Henry looks up, outraged.

</b>                         It's the law.

               Henry throws his cigarette to the floor, steps on it and 
               returns to his magazine.

               Henry shakes his head in dismay and studies a centerfold.

               at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip.

                         the light of God. Amen.

               He sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop 
               carnations at the grave. Simon and Fay remain there looking 
               down at the coffin. Henry waits for them a few yards away, 
               wishing he could help, but feeling out of place.

               Simon is back working on the garbage truck. He collects 
               garbage and throws it in the truck as Henry, who is just 
               along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and 
               pulls the lever whenever Simon tells him to.

                         know you!

               Henry shrugs and qualifies...

                         buddies or anything. But we used to 
                         talk sometimes. In the elevator. In 
                         the morning. He said he liked my 
                         ideas. Being a janitor's a good job 
                         if you're a writer. Especially the 
                         night shift; all that time to think 
                         and develop my ideas.

               Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed.

                         literary art if it came up and bit 
                         him in the leg. To hell with him! 
                         He's not the only publisher in the

                         It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded 
                         in his own land. Remember that.

               Henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something 
               in amongst the garbage...

               Henry steps down and leans over into the garbage. Simon joins 
               him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray 
               piece of machinery.

<b>                                     HENRY

</b>                         Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.

</b>                         It's a ring. Jewelry.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         I think it's a gasket. A fitting 
                         from off of that old refrigerator 
                         over there.

               Henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and Simon jumps on 
               the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away. 
               Henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops 
               when he sees Pearl age seven.

               Henry comes up the street with Pearl age seven on his back. 
               He walks into Vicky's yard and finds Warren lifting weights 
               in the garage.

<b>                                     HENRY

               Warren rests. He sits up on the bench and takes a toke off 
               the joint he has waiting.

<b>                                     WARREN

                         human being. Try to contribute 
                         something meaningful to society. And 
                         what happens? They lose to a bunch 
                         of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups.

                         deserve what they get.

               Henry pauses, then leads Pearl age seven towards the house. 
               Warren lies back down and continues his lifting.

               tenderly...

               He sighs and drinks his coffee, then looks back at her.

               Frowning, she reconsiders. She gets up and takes the notebooks 
               from the cabinet above the fridge. She flips through the 
               pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer 
               attitude.

               But he's gone. It's as if he has vanished into thin air. She 
               sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the 
               Internet.

<b>               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry comes back into the store, satisfied with himself. He 
               finishes off his coffee, tosses away the cup and takes a 
               pornographic magazine from the rack. He leans on the counter 
               where Mr Deng is busy working and flips through the pages.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         espressos, Mr Deng.

               Mr Deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine.

<b>                                     MR DENG

</b>                         Well then put it back.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         There's this fascinating story about 
                         a famous rock band and how they tied 
                         a friend of theirs to a bed in their 
                         hotel room and inserted a live fish 
                         into her vagina.

               Mr Deng shakes his head and frowns.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (explains)
                         They say she had numerous orgasms.

<b>                                     MR DENG
</b>                         Henry, you need to do something with 
                         your life. Get a job, or something.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I mean, it wasn't the entire fish, 
                         it was just, you know, the nose. The 
                         nose of the fish.

               Mr Deng brings over the coffee. Henry is surprised to notice 
               he is not riveted.

<b>                                     HENRY

</b>                         No.

               Henry closes the magazine and puts it back. Leaning on the 
               counter, he sips his coffee and ponders.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         You ever wonder what it would be

                         and get out of here.

                         as people and often more attractive.

               Mr Deng just goes back to work, leaving Henry there at the 
               counter thinking big thoughts.

<b>               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- EVENING
</b>
               Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street 
               and pauses in front of his house. He jumps down and the truck 
               barrels away.

<b>               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- EVENING
</b>
               Simon taps at the door. She looks over at him and he sees 
               she's been crying. He comes into the room and she sits up on 
               the edge of the bed.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Did you see him?

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         He came by this afternoon.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Did you talk?

</b>                         No.

               He comes over and sits beside her. He thinks a moment, then...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         You've got to tell him, Fay.

</b>                         He thinks I'm a slut.

               And she starts crying again. Simon awkwardly touches her 
               shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself 
               together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO
</b>
               Moments later.

               Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks 
               ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. 
               He is staring sickly at 'the ring'.

<b>                                     SIMON

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Simon, I don't feel so good.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         What's wrong?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.

               Simon lifts the coffee container and smells it.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         How many of these did you have?

               Henry tries to remember. He squints.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Seven.

               Simon puts the container down and sits at the table.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Henry, we have to talk.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Can I use your toilet?

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Fay's taking a shower.

               Henry grabs his stomach. He presses his hand against his 
               chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         How much you think I can get for 
                         this?

               He looks at Simon.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                              (pauses)
                         Henry, Fay's pregnant.

               Henry looks at him.

</b>                         Fay's pregnant with your child.

               Henry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White 
               with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM
</b>
               Moments later.

               Fay is in the shower as...

               Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and 
               trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower 
               curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet 
               just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, 
               terrified and disgusted, in the shower.

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Jesus, Henry!

               Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent 
               and messy blast of noise and foul air.

               Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly.

               Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, 
               sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel 
               and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him 
               and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.

<b>                                     FAY

               He is destroyed, staring down at...

               The 'ring' he still holds in his hand.

               Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from 
               him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly 
               admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words...

<b>                                     FAY
</b>                         Oh. Oh, Henry.

               And she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating 
               and spent, on the toilet.

<b>               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               A month later.

               Mr Deng and Buñuel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into 
               the church foyer. Once inside, he shakes them off and they 
               stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out 
               of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, 
               then stops, sees...

               Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon. She is beautiful.

               Henry calms down, deeply affected.

               Fay smiles down the aisle at him.

               Henry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and 
               strides up the aisle.

               Also present at the ceremony are Vicky and Warren. Gnoc is 
               maid of honor.

               The doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak 
               and everyone turns from the altar to see...

               Amy enter. She steps in and stands there, alarmed, clutching 
               a long scroll of fax paper.

               Simon walks down the aisle to see to Amy.

               The guests watch and wait.

               As Simon reaches her, Amy looks away from the altar and shows

               He studies the fax and recognizes his poem. He grows 
               concerned.

               Later that evening.

               The whole neighborhood is celebrating Fay's wedding. The 
               music is loud. The people are drunk. The place is a shambles. 
               A big dance number is playing. Amidst all the festivities, 
               though, Simon and Buñuel have the small TV propped up on top 
               of the fridge, following the evening news...

                         Jim, at World of Donuts about one 
                         year ago today, when local garbage 
                         man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper 
                         and began to compose what many have 
                         come to regard as vicious, antisocial 
                         and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines 
                         of unrhymed free meter verse which 
                         would one day serve to spark the

                         This is outrageous! Measures must be 
                         taken. Have we debased our culture

                         with a head full of sick ideas is

                         Poetry of this kind, and this poem

                         the extremes of human experience; of 
                         solitude, of community. It is perhaps 
                         alarming, even upsetting to some -- 
                         myself included -- but it must be

                         Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope 
                         issued a message of hope for believers 
                         in their fight against what he termed 
                         the godless and lost. He did not 
                         mention Simon Grim by name, but 
                         offered a prayer for the young whom 
                         he described as sadly in need of 
                         faith and not the illusion of 
                         conviction offered by rock music, 
                         drugs and contemporary poetry.

               The TV is switched off. It's later now. People are passed 
               out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting 
               around the table. Fay steps back from the TV, drains a glass 
               of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding 
               gown. She hugs Simon, who is deeply unsettled by the news of 
               his growing infamy.

               A huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors, trying

               Simon thinks this over, but says nothing. Angus comes over 
               and lays his hand on his shoulder.

               excited adolescents. He reaches his limo and gets in. But he 
               pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd.

               Simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and 
               shouting for autographs. Angus shakes his head, impressed.

               Simon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands.

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</b>
               Simon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking 
               off at...

               The stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'.

<b>               EXT. HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY
</b>
               Henry stands outside, watching his door.

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</b>
               Simon lifts the first volume, opens it and begins reading. 
               He sits.

<b>               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY
</b>
               Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously.

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</b>
               Simon strides the length of the living room, reading. He 
               stops, frowns.

<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</b>
               Simon reads in front of the fire.

<b>               EXT. BACKYARD/GARAGE -- NIGHT
</b>
               Buñuel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks 
               to himself. Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him. 
               He looks at her, but says nothing. She sighs and goes back 
               inside: turning off the lights.

               The next morning.

               Simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve 
               as the morning sun streaks into the room. Finally, he finishes 
               and slowly closes the book. He stands and crosses the room. 
               Leaning against the wall, he removes his glasses and rubs 
               his aching eyes.

<b>               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY
</b>
               Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep 
               on the back stoop.

<b>               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               Simon stares into a glass of water. Fay sits ten feet away, 
               waiting. Finally...

               The 'Confession' lies on the big desk. Angus' hand comes

               Angus pauses and figures. He changes the subject.

</b>                         I'm offering you a very real 
                         expression of my faith in your 
                         writing. Two hundred thousand dollars 
                         and a sixty/forty split.

</b>                         Look, Simon, you don't require my 
                         admiration. You require my experience 
                         as a publisher. And that experience 
                         leads me to believe your poem will 
                         make more money than any book of 
                         poetry ever published. In history. 
                         Virtually make you a household name 
                         within two years. You'll never have 
                         to work on a garbage truck again, I 
                         assure you. Or do anything else for 
                         that matter. Whereas this 'Confession' 
                         by Henry Fool...

               He is at a loss for words.

                         The man is a scoundrel.

<b>                                     ANGUS
</b>                         No! He encouraged all that was 
                         expressive in you to become manifest. 
                         He inspired you to act. He influenced 
                         your perception.

               Simon waits a while, staring at his shoes.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         How about if my advance is only a 
                         hundred thousand?

</b>                         It's not about money, Simon.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         We could split the royalties 
                         seventy/thirty.

<b>                                     ANGUS
</b>                         I will not publish Henry Fool's 
                         'Confession'.

               Simon sits and lets this sink in. Angus waits, then...

<b>                                     ANGUS
</b>                         Will you sign the contract?

               Simon continues looking out at the city. Angus waits, but 
               there is no response. Finally, Simon turns, pauses and slowly 
               crosses the room.

               He sits at the table and looks down at the contract.

               He signs.

<b>               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Fay is in labor. Henry helps her into her coat as they rush 
               for the door.

<b>               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking 
               at Hawkes, Buñuel and Mr Deng. Gnoc runs out to get Fay.

<b>               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY
</b>
               Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out.

<b>               INT. VAN -- DAY
</b>
               Henry drives recklessly. Fay rolls around in the back.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY
</b>
               Fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall. She is 
               gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM -- DAY
</b>
               Fay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her. 
               She is scared. She looks over at...

               Henry, looking in through the window. He looks scared too.

               Fay is sedated by gas.

               Henry is taken away by the Nurse.

               Fay stares up at the ceiling.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
               Henry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted.

               Simon comes running up the hall and finds him. It's late and 
               no one is around. He sits down beside Henry and shakes him.

               Henry wakes.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Simon? You're here.

               He sits up and Simon sits beside him.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         What happened?

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                              (coughs)
                         It's a boy.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         And Fay?

</b>                         She's alright.

               Simon sits back, relieved. Then he remembers the rain-soaked 
               shopping bag he has with him. He pulls out a couple of cans 
               of beer and hands one to Henry.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Thanks.

               They look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the 
               coast is clear. Then they pop open the beers and toast.

               They drink. Then...

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         How did it go?

               Simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room. He 
               looks out of the window and gathers his strength.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't 
                         like your 'Confession'.

               Henry looks at Simon blankly, then blinks and looks away.

<b>                                     HENRY

               Silence. Simon comes back and sits again.

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                         No. He didn't.

                         I can do to make it more accessible.

</b>                         I can soften up some of the language 
                         and make it read easier. Take out 
                         some of the more intratextual 
                         references and popularize the 
                         underlying Sturm und Drang, so to 
                         speak. I can change its mode. Make 
                         it more of a conventional novel 
                         instead.

               Simon just stares at him blankly, then sighs and shakes his 
               head.

                         Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist! I 
                         appreciate your protectiveness, but 
                         the integrity of the work gives it a 
                         durability that can sustain such 
                         things.

               Simon comes over and lays his hand on Henry's shoulder.

               He steps away and sits. Henry pauses, then approaches and 
               leans down over him.

               Henry stands there a moment longer, then lowers himself into

               Simon sits there a moment, numb with grief. Henry, red in 
               the face, stares at the floor. Suddenly, Simon stands and 
               walks out. Henry looks up and watches him go. He can hardly 
               believe it. He almost raises his voice and apologizes, but 
               can't. He lowers his head again and covers his face with his 
               hands, listening to Simon's footsteps receding through the 
               halls.

               Simon walks on, away from us, down the hospital corridor.

               Fay bangs out of the kitchen door with her seven-year-old 
               son Ned. Frazzled and overworked, she grips a loaded laundry 
               basket to her side as she sits Ned down on the curb and points

               The kid sits still, obviously guilty of some unspeakable

               He hands Ned a cigarette and lights it for him. Ned takes a

<b>               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT
</b>
               The place is abandoned.

               Henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep 
               on an old couch, finds Pearl age fourteen.

               She is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and 
               scared; a troubled kid.

<b>                                     HENRY

                         Some what?

               Pearl comes towards him. He is kneeling with his face at her 
               crotch level when she reaches him. She holds out a bottle of 
               cheap rot-gut wine. Realizing, he takes it and drinks. He 
               winces.

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Shit!

               Pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater 
               hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying 
               her underwear.

               Henry stands and searches for something to sit on.

               She pats the couch beside her.

               He comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits. He hands back 
               the bottle. She drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames.

                         'You want some?'

               Henry looks away, uncomfortable. She slides her gaze over to 
               him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot.

               He gets up and stands at the window. Pearl age fourteen 
               watches him closely as she drinks, then...

               He looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder. 
               Henry is sweating.

<b>                                     HENRY

               And he starts to leave. But Pearl sits up...

               Henry stops and looks back at her.

               Henry holds his head, tries to sober up. He looks around the 
               room, then focuses on the girl.

<b>                                     HENRY

               Pearl stares at the floor. She glances over at him, then 
               back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. She nods.

               Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself 
               tentatively to the couch.

                         Do you think I'm pretty?

               Henry lifts his hand and covers his face. He looks up at the 
               ceiling and sighs. He returns to Pearl...

<b>                                     HENRY
</b>                         Does she need help?

               Pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh. Looking up at him, 
               with tears rolling down her face, she suggests...

<b>                                     PEARL
</b>                         I'll suck your cock if you kill him 
                         for me.

               Henry jumps away from her and Pearl throws herself down on 
               the couch, covering her face.

               He runs through the house, checking the rooms. He throws 
               open the door to the bedroom and finds...

               Vicky, sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking. She has a 
               black eye and a swollen cheek.

               Henry looks over and sees Warren stumble drunkenly out of 
               the bathroom. What are you doing in my house?

                         It's about Pearl.

               Vicky looks troubled. She sits back down with a sigh.

                         are, anyway?

               Henry falls back and looks at Vicky. She looks away.

               Henry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard 
               shove.

               Warren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts 
               into viciousness.

               He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where 
               he hits the wall and collapses.

               As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. 
               Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren 
               kicks him in the side of the head.

               Vicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears.

               Warren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face 
               and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees. 
               Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety. Warren grabs 
               his feet and drags him out. As he is dragged across the floor, 
               Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it. He rolls over on his 
               back as...

               Warren lunges down at him again and...

<b>                                     WARREN
</b>                         Ah.

               Warren is stabbed in the heart.

               Henry can't believe it.

               Warren can't believe it. He stands there in the middle of 
               the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of 
               his chest.

               Henry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the 
               back door and coughs up a few of his teeth. Vicky steps into 
               the hall from her room and shudders.

               Warren sits at the table, stunned. He looks from the 
               screwdriver to Vicky, then...

               Henry staggers away, limping. He comes to the intersection 
               at the end of the block and doesn't know which way to run. 
               Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest. He

               He picks at the bedspread and looks at the ceiling, then...

               He walks around to the other side of the bed and waits a

               Fay sits up, pauses and studies her son.

               Ned is happy to hear this. He shuffles out of the room and 
               Fay falls back on the bed.

               Moments later.

               Ned comes into the kitchen and digs through the drawers 
               beneath the sink. He finds an envelope. He reads the return 
               address: Chelsea Hotel, New York City.

<b>               EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

               Ned approaches the subway station and climbs the stairs to 
               the platform.

               Moments later.

               Ned runs up the stairs to the elevated platform just as a 
               train pulls into the station. He runs down a few cars and 
               hops in as the doors slide open.

               He comes up out of the subway on to the street, looks around.

<b>               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY
</b>
               He comes into the hotel and rings an annoying buzzer which 
               brings out the concierge, who is in his little office, 
               watching TV.

               The concierge looks through his book as Ned waits.

               Ned pulls the envelope from his pocket, unfolds it and shows 
               it to the concierge.

               The concierge studies the envelope and hands it back.

               Disappointed, Ned takes back the envelope and stands looking 
               at his sneakers.

               Ned steps away from the front desk and moves towards the 
               door. But then he stops and looks back at...

               The concierge, sitting back in his office, returning his 
               attention to the TV set.

               The boy heads for the elevator.

               The concierge looks up and sees him.

               Ned checks his step and runs for the service stairs.

               The concierge goes after him.

<b>               INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Ned runs up the stairs, the concierge in pursuit.

               Moments later.

               Ned jumps out into the hall, narrowly escaping the clutches 
               of the concierge, who falls to the floor.

               Ned runs up the hall, checking the room numbers as the 
               concierge gets to his feet. He finds...

               Room 423.

               He knocks.

               The concierge strides up the hall towards him.

               Ned knocks again.

               The concierge bears down upon him.

               He knocks again and...

               The door opens a crack, held by its safety chain. A female 
               figure in silhouette is at the narrow gap.

               Ned looks from the door to the concierge approaching.

               The concierge arrives and reaches out for him, but the door 
               opens wide and Ned dives in.

<b>               INT. HOTEL ROOM 423 -- DAY

               Same time.

               The concierge stands in the hallway. The door swings shut in 
               his face.

               Ned kneels on the floor of the hotel room, waiting to be 
               smacked, or something.

               But when nothing happens, he opens his eyes and looks back 
               over his shoulder at...

               Laura, the secretary from the publishing house. She is dressed 
               for travel and has her coat hung over her arm, a suitcase in 
               her hand. She smiles at him, then looks from the boy to 
               someone across the room and...

               Ned follows her gaze to find...

               Simon, standing there before him, a suitcase in his hand as 
               well. He looks down at Ned with a calm, intrigued expression.

               The boy looks up at him in awe.

               Simon steps forward, pauses, then...

               He does.

<b>               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               A taxi pulls up. Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out 
               of the window.

<b>                                     LAURA

               They kiss. The taxi pulls away. Simon comes down beside Ned, 
               takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear.

               The kid takes off.

               Simon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting 
               there at the door.

<b>               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Gnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen. A band is seen 
               doing a sound check, inside.

               Buñuel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned.

               Simon gives Buñuel his passport.

               Buñuel nods and leaves.

               Hawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors.

               Moments later.

               Simon is lead down the stairs and stops. He looks on in horror 
               at...

               Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. 
               Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages.

               Simon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches 
               Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. 
               Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with 
               his hand.

                         fault. I swear!

               Simon thinks about this and looks away.

               Henry thinks about that, sighs and looks away.

               Fay packs up the many books of the 'Confession' into one of 
               the old suitcases Henry first came to town with. She slams 
               it shut.

<b>               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Ned runs along the street and stops at the police car. He 
               points down the street with great urgency. The cops jump in 
               their cars and take off. He then looks over at...

               Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase.

<b>               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS BACK ALLEY -- DAY

               Buñuel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts. 
               Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport.

               Simon checks it and then looks up to see...

               Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out 
               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on 
               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with 
               difficulty.

               Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights 
               his dad's cigarette.

               Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...

               Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands 
               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across 
               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently 
               and waits for his last line of crap.

                         Yeah, well, tough.

               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses 
               her passionately on the mouth.

               Moments later, they all help Henry into Buñuel's car and 
               Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon 
               steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay 
               running along beside the car with the rest of the 
               neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...

               Airline representatives come rushing up with walkie-talkies 
               to meet Henry and Simon as they run through the terminal.

               As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and 
               looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for 
               him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal.

                         Go on.

               Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and 
               check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place 
               it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector. 
               They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands 
               there with his hands outstretched, as...

               Simon waits and watches.

               The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry 
               grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint 
               at...

               Simon, standing there. He steps forward anxiously.

               Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives 
               are at his side...

<b>                                     AIRLINE REP
</b>                         Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting! 
                         We have to hurry!

               They drag him away, but Henry looks back as...

               Simon stops and watches.

<b>               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY
</b>
               Moments later.

               The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline 
               representative runs straight for it, calling back over her 
               shoulder to Henry...

<b>                                     AIRLINE REP
</b>                         This way, Mr Grim! This way!

               Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs 
               back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his 
               shoulder at...

               Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal.

               He stops and waits.

               Simon raises his hand in farewell and...

               Henry raises his in reply.

               Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent 
               amongst the roar of the runway, says...

<b>                                     SIMON
</b>                              (unheard)
                         Run.

               And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a 
               moment, then turns and looks out at...

               The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him 
               from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie-
               talkie.

               He glances back once more at Simon. Then...

               Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself 
               towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with 
               every step he takes.
