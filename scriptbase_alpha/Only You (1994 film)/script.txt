SUPER: 1968

On a darkened living room, a huge summer moon spilling silver
through a window.

We move slowly across the mantelpiece where a pair of candles
glow, illuminating family photos.  Weddings two, maybe three
generations back -- brides in white, their young grooms at
their sides, frozen in time.  As we pan, we hear two VOICES
offscreen: a BOY'S and a GIRL'S.

               GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
     Stop pushing it.  You're not
     supposed to force it.  You're
     supposed to just let it happen.

               BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
     I'm not pushing it, you're pushing
     it.

               GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
     I am not.

Silence.  Until,

               GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
     You're pushing it again.

An exasperated sigh.

               BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
     Well, hurry up.  My foot's falling
     asleep.

               GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
     Mo-mmm.  Larry's pushing it.

Mom?

               MOM (O.S.)
          (from the next
          room)
     Larry, don't push it.

And now, we finally pan over to discover two KIDS playing with
a Ouija board.  For future reference, the players are FAITH
(age eleven), and her brother LARRY (ten).

               LARRY
     I'M NOT PUSHING IT.

               FAITH
     Wait.  I have to write this down.

A groan out of him.  She grabs a piece of paper and starts
scrawling out a series of letters.


               FAITH
     Grandma told me everybody has a
     soul mate.

               FAITH
     But most people never find theirs,
     most people settle.  I'm never
     gonna settle.

She gazes up as the ripe summer moon slips behind a bank of
clouds.

               FAITH
     This way I'll know the name of the
     man I'm supposed to wait for.

The arrow continues to move around the board, stopping on
various letters which she copies down.

               LARRY
     Yeah, but, what if this guy lived
     a billion, trillion years ago?
     Like, what if he was a cave man,
     and now he's dead?

               FAITH
     Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's
     my destiny, then, obviously, he
     has to be alive.

Another letter.

               LARRY
     Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live
     here?  Like, what if he's a
     cannibal in New Guinea or
     something?

               FAITH
     If I live here, then he lives here.
     Fate wouldn't make a mistake like
     that.
          (beat)
     And stop talking.  You're gonna
     ruin the spell.

Another pause.  Another letter.  Then...  Ever the devil's
advocate,


               LARRY
          (whispering)
     Yeah, but... but, Faith, what if
     he does live here, and one day you
     just walk past him on the street?
     I mean, you don't hear his name,
     you don't get a chance to introduce
     yourselves.  You practically bump
     straight into each other, but you
     never even know it?

Right in his face,

               FAITH
     We'll KNOW.

               LARRY
     Okaaaaayyyy.

The arrow comes slowly to a halt.  And she writes down the
final letter, as the moon again breaks through the clouds,
throwing a bright white beam of light directly onto the name
which reads:

               FAITH (O.S.)
          (a whisper)
     Damon Bradley.
          (she looks up,
          spellbound)
     He's the one.

Beat.

               LARRY
     Goodie.  Can I ask about the Series
     now?

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

A screaming face.  Whirling lights.  A local carnival.  The
small-town traveling kind.

SUPER:  THREE YEARS LATER.

Up on the ferris wheel, a bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
are distinguishing themselves by hurling water balloons down
at carnival-goers.  Among the participants is Faith's brother
Larry.

PULL DOWN from them to "MADAME DIVINA'S FORTUNE TELLING
BOOTH". "Know Your Fate".  Clustered in front of it are a
bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS.


We should recognize Faith as one of them.  Another girl,
LESLIE, is egging a friend on.

               LESLIE
     Go on, go on...
          (to the rest)
     She wants to know if she's gonna
     marry Alex.

               GIRL #2
     I do not.  I'm not gonna marry
     Alex.
          (obviously)
     He doesn't even have a car.

               LESLIE
     But he's got pretty eyes.  That
     means your kids would have pretty
     eyes.  You can always get a car
     later, but you can't always find
     pretty eyes.  You gotta think
     ahead.

               GIRL #3
     Who cares about pretty eyes,
     Leslie?  I'm telling you, stocks,
     bonds, real estate -- that's what
     you wanna look for in a man.

               GIRL #4
          (dismissing)
     Heh...

               GIRL #3
     What then?

               GIRL #4
          (the voice of
          authority)
     Definitely sex.

Somebody else pipes up,

               GIRL #5
     My mom told me you gotta want the
     same things out of life.  Have the
     same values, be able to
     communicate.

They all turn to look blankly at this poor, misguided soul.

               GIRL #5
     I'm just telling you what she said.


They're still looking at her.

               GIRL #5
     It's not like I believed her or
     anything...

               FAITH
     I think you're all wrong.

               LESLIE
     What do you think the most
     important thing is, Faith?

There is not a doubt in her mind.

               FAITH
     True love.  I believe there's one
     special person out there who's
     meant for each of us.  And when
     your eyes meet, it'll be magic and
     you'll both know it instantly.

A couple of dissenters roll their eyes.

               FAITH
          (turning to another
          friend)
     Don't you think so, Kate?

KATE's looking at the ground, trying to sound casual.

               KATE
     I don't know, I guess I never
     really thought about it...
          (in her next
          breath)
     Is Larry here?

               FAITH
          (she couldn't care
          less)
     Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

Up above, Larry takes careful aim, then sends a water balloon
torpedoing their way.  It hits the ground between them with
an enormous SPLAT.  They SCREAM.

INT. FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH - NIGHT

We move past them, through a beaded window and into the booth
where a disheveled older WOMAN, MADAME DIVINA, is paging
through a copy of "Scientific American".


There's a TAP at the door.  She checks her watch.  Curses.
She shoves the magazine in a drawer, then hoists a bowling
ball, the kind with the iridescent swirls in them, onto an
opening in the center of the table, carefully positioning it
so the three holes aren't visible.  She flicks on a flashlight
above it.  Crystal ball.

Back outside, the girl everybody-thinks-is-going-to-marry-Alex
is nervous.

               GIRL #2
     But what if she tells me something
     bad?  I don't want to hear anything
     bad...

               KATE
     They never tell you anything bad.
     Nobody'd ever go to them if they
     did.

The door opens.  The WOMAN'S imposing hulk casts a shadow down
over them.  They look up.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Who knocked?

Like deer in the headlights.

               GIRL #2
          (pointing at Kate)
     She did.

               KATE
          (pointing at girl
          #2)
     She did.

Nobody moves, until,

               FAITH (O.S.)
     I did.

Faith looks at her friends, shrugs, then gamely ventures
inside past the beads and sits down.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     What's your name?

               FAITH
     Faith.

               FORTUNE TELLER
          (lighting a candle)
     What do you wanna know, Faith?


               FAITH
     Um, just basic destiny stuff, I
     guess.  But-- I don't want to hear
     anything bad.
          (beat)
     If that's okay.

Madame Divina starts laying out a series of tarot cards.
Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK at the back door.  Faith jumps.

               FORTUNE TELLER
          (dismissing)
     Spirits.

She lays down a couple more cards.  Then a persistent
"PSSSSTTTT", "PSSSSTTT".  More BANGING.

               FORTUNE TELLER
          (hollering)
     Harry, I'm outta change.

More KNOCKING.  Harry is determined.  Annoyed, Mme.  Divina
finally gets up.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     How come I always wind up next door
     to the freak show?
          (as she goes)
     Just because they're midgets does
     that mean they don't have to go
     to the bank like the rest of us?

She lumbers to the back of the booth, throws open a back door
and looks down.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     What?

Inside, Faith is nervously eying the cards.  Her friend KATE
peeks in through the beads.

               KATE
          (mouthing the words
          and pointing)
     Is that a bowling ball?

Faith doesn't understand.  Kate mimes a bowling motion,
swinging her arm.  Faith shrugs.  As the woman returns, from
outside we overhear,

               BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
     Hey, Kate.  Larry wants you.


               LARRY (O.S.)
     I do not.

Kate grins, ducks out.  Mme. Divina sits back down.  Closes
her eyes.  Fingers the ball, entranced.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Something is coming to me.  I'm
     getting... a name.

Faith leans forward.

               FORTUNE TELLER
          (straining)
     This name is very important to
     you...  Da--  David.  No-- no...

A faint breeze flutters through the room and the candle starts
to flicker.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Damon.

Faith's heart skips a beat.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     His name is...
          (her eyes pop open
          with startling
          intensity)
     Damon Bradley.

It is, of course, the same name.

               FAITH
     Omigod.  Omigod.
          (getting up)
     I have to go.

She seizes Faith's hand.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Just a minute--

Faith freezes.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Your destiny's two dollars.

Faith pulls out two bills, drops them on the table.  Bolts
for the door.  But the woman stops her again.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     Hey--


She leans in very close and pulls Faith toward her.  We should
sense that this is not part of the act.  This is for real.

               FORTUNE TELLER
     The truth is, no matter what the
     cards say, you make your own
     destiny.  Don't wait for it to come
     to you.  You understand?

Faith nods.  Still in shock.

               FAITH
     Can I be excused now?

                                   CUT TO:

SUPER: TWENTY YEARS LATER -- SATURDAY NIGHT

We hear pouring rain.  But what sounds like rain is actually
the shower, as we pull back to find Mitzi Gaynor washing that
man right out of her hair.  "SOUTH PACIFIC" is on television.
We pull back even further to reveal three WOMEN watching.
A big Saturday night.  There's a lot of chocolate on the
table.

The women are:  the adult FAITH.  Attractive, a little dreamy.
The walls of her apartment are adorned with reproductions of
famous works all featuring a similar theme, Rodin's "The
Kiss", Botticelli's "Birth of Venus", etc.  Bookshelves are
crammed with volumes of poetry.  She's absentmindedly pulling
the petals off a bouquet of flowers on the table.

Also in attendance: KATE, her childhood friend turned
housewife and sister-in-law.  Kate is a pragmatist.  She's
clipping coupons out of the newspaper as they watch.  And,
doing her nails, LESLIE.  Big hair.  Good heart.  Not the
sharpest tool in the shed.

As the movie cuts to a commercial,

               LESLIE
     I'm just saying I think it would
     be a good idea.

               KATE
          (dubiously)
     Date police...

               LESLIE
     Yes.  A guy who says he's gonna
     call, then doesn't, ought to get
     slapped with a citation, that's
     all.

Faith glances at Kate.  They're used to Leslie.

               LESLIE
          (blowing on her
          nails)
     Anyway, like I said, I've given
     it a lot of thought and I've
     finally narrowed it down.
          (beat)
     A heterosexual with a job.

               FAITH
     Well, I don't think it's asking
     too much to want to feel it in my
     head and my heart and my body and
     my soul all at the same time, and
     to have that feeling to be mutual.
     Pass the M&Ms please.

Her friends groan.  They're used to Faith.  Kate hands the
candy over.

               LESLIE
     Not as long as you're not hoping
     to find it on planet Earth.

               KATE
     Leslie's right, Faith.  You've got
     to start being more practical.
     Do you know what the statistics
     are, the marriage odds for women
     your age?

               FAITH
     I don't believe in statistics.

               KATE
     You're an accountant for cryin'
     out loud.

Faith holds out both palms, gesturing that her point has been
made.

               KATE
     What about that guy you work with,
     Mike what's-his-name?

               FAITH
          (shaking her head)
     No.  He smokes.

               KATE
     How about the other one?  His
     friend.

               FAITH
     Just moved in with his girlfriend.

               KATE
          (brightly)
     How about that guy at the bank?

Faith pops another M&M.

               FAITH
     Scientologist.

               KATE
          (deflated)
     Oh.

Beat.

               KATE
     So, you gotta be a little flexible.
     Look at your brother and me.
     Larry's not perfect, neither am
     I.  But we work it out.  We're not
     unrealistic in our expectations,
     and we have each other.
          (setting down her
          scissors)
     I think you've got the Door Number
     Three Syndrome.

               FAITH
     Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--

               LESLIE
     Yeah, I saw that.  Like on Let's
     Make A Deal.  You've got the Amana
     freezer and you can keep it, or
     risk it on what's behind Door
     Number Three.  Which usually turns
     out to be a donkey.

Faith looks at Kate.

               FAITH
     I don't have an Amana freezer.

               KATE
     It's a metaphor.  It's women who
     always think there's some unknown
     out there that's going to be better
     than what's in front of them.  And
     instead wind up with nothing.

               FAITH
     Metaphorically, I still don't have
     an Amana freezer.

               KATE
     I think if you're honest with
     yourself, you'll admit you've had
     a chance at a number of Amana
     appliances in your lifetime.

She knows there's probably some ugly truth to this.  Luckily,
the PHONE RINGS.  Faith picks it up.

               FAITH
     Hello?  Hi, Larry.
          (beat)
     Yeah, she's here.  Hold on.
          (turning to Kate)
     It's your husband.

INT. LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

LARRY, Kate's husband, Faith's brother, is at the kitchen
table, munching the last crumbs out of a bag of potato chips
and watching television.

               LARRY
     Kate, you're still there?  I
     thought you'd be on your way home
     by now.

INT. FAITH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               KATE
     You miss me?...

INT. LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               LARRY
     Uh, yeah.  Sure.
          (gazing forlornly
          into the
          refrigerator)
     Honey, did you forget the guys are
     coming over tonight?

               KATE (ON PHONE)
     No, why?

               LARRY
          (helplessly)
     Well, there's nothing here to eat.

INT. FAITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Over the movie, we hear yelling -- Kate's half of the fight
-- in the background.  Then the SLAMMING of the receiver.

When she comes back into the room, the "Some Enchanted
Evening" number is on.  Faith is mouthing the words.  Kate
starts picking up her coupons.

               FAITH
     Is everything okay?

               KATE
     Yes.
          (glancing at the
          tv, annoyed)
     You know all the shrinks on Donahue
     say that all those love songs about
     some enchanted evening are just
     a cruel hoax that feeds people's
     fantasies.

               FAITH
          (a little
          plaintive)
     But somebody wrote those songs.

               KATE
     So, what's your point?

               FAITH
     Just that they came out of
     somebody's experience is all.

               KATE
     No, Faith.  They came out of
     somebody's imagination.

EXT. FAITH'S DOOR - NIGHT

Faith walks her friends to the door, opens it.

               FAITH
     I wish you didn't have to go so
     early.

               KATE
          (still annoyed)
     Yeah, well, Larry and his friends
     are hungry.
          (relenting)
     And I did say I'd try to pick
     something up.

               LESLIE
     And I told Ted I'd be home later
     if he wanted to stop by.

               FAITH
     I thought you said you thought he
     had a date.

               LESLIE
     Well, after that.

As they talk, a slight GUY, one who might best be described
as, well, non-descript, walks by and heads into his apartment.

               NON-DESCRIPT GUY
     How's it going?

               FAITH
     Pretty well, Dwayne.  How about
     you?

               DWAYNE
     Can't complain.

He closes his door.  Kate looks at Faith.  Who shakes her
head.

               FAITH
     No.

               KATE
     Is he married?

               FAITH
     No.

               KATE
     Is he gay?

               FAITH
     I don't know.  I don't think so.

               KATE
     So?...

               FAITH
     So, he's not my type.
          (beat)
     Let me walk you to the elevator.

They walk.

               KATE
     What's he do?

               FAITH
     I don't know, Kate.

               KATE
     You don't have any idea?

               FAITH
     He's a podiatrist or something.

               KATE AND LESLIE
          (in unison)
     He's a doctor?

               FAITH
     Look, there's no chemistry there,
     okay?  There's no... thrill.

               KATE
     "Thrills"?  That's what you're
     waiting for?  You know how long
     that lasts?  Besides, how do you
     know?  Have you ever been out with
     him?

               FAITH
     No.  He's never asked me.

               KATE
     Why don't you ask him?

               FAITH
     Why should I ask someone out who
     I don't want to go out with in the
     first place?

               KATE
     If you've never been out with him,
     how do you know you don't want to
     go out with him?

               LESLIE
          (almost more to
          herself)
     I thought he was kinda cute...

Faith sighs.  Mercifully, the elevator doors finally open.
Kate and Leslie get in.  As the doors close,

               KATE
     Take a chance, Faith...  None of
     us is getting any younger...

INT. FAITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Faith re-enters her apartment.  The answering machine light
is blinking.  She plays the message back as she gets ready
for bed.

               ANSWERING MACHINE
     Hi, honey.  It's Mom.  I just
     wanted to apologize if I upset you
     at brunch today.

To herself in the bathroom mirror,

               FAITH
     If you upset me at brunch today?

               ANSWERING MACHINE
          (correcting
          herself)
     For upsetting you at brunch today.
     Now, you know I don't think you're
     a failure.  And if you never get
     married, that's perfectly fine with
     your father and me.

Faith is applying eye cream.  She leans in closer, carefully
examining the lines around her eyes.

               ANSWERING MACHINE
     Of course you're not a freak.
     You're right, plenty of people
     aren't married.
          (trying to be
          supportive)
     The guy who cuts my hair isn't
     married.  Hey...  maybe you tw--
          (a voice in the
          background)
     He's gay.
          (her mother)
     Oh.  Never mind.  Anyway, if you
     want to spend the rest of your life
     alone, well, that's your choice.
     And I respect it.  I just want you
     to be happy, that's all.
          (beat)
     Hold on, your Dad wants to say
     something.
          (male voice)
     Good fruit salad today, Faith.
          (Mom takes the
          phone back)
     We'll talk to you soon, sweetie.

The machine shuts off.  Faith gets into bed.  Reaches for the
light.  Then, remembering something, gets up.

There's a daily calendar lying on her dresser.  She rips off
the top page, crumples it into a ball, drops it into the
wastebasket.

And turns out the light.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

A vast audience of PEOPLE, all clad in ridiculous get-ups.
Faith is wearing a chicken suit.  Her Mother is there, in an
octopus costume.  Kate and Larry are Siamese twins.  Leslie
is dressed as a radish.  MONTY HALL steps up to Faith.

               MONTY HALL
     So, which one is it gonna be,
     Faith?  Will it be... Door Number
     One?...

DWAYNE, the podiatrist, peeks out from between the curtains
of Door Number One.  Waves.  The CROWD goes WILD.

               MONTY HALL
     Door Number Two?...

The distinct BRAYING of a DONKEY can be heard emanating from
behind Door Number Two.

               MONTY HALL
     Or Door Number Three?...

A complete mystery.  This one seems to glow.

               ALL
          (chanting)
     Take Dwayne!  Take Dwayne!

CAROL MERRILL is running an arm sensuously along Door Number
One.

               FAITH
          (nervously)
     Door Number Three?

Murmurs of dismay ripple through the crowd.  The curtains
part. To reveal a shriveled OLD CRONE, covered in cobwebs,
who bears an unsettling resemblance to Faith.  The crowd BOOS.

INT. FAITH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Faith shoots up in bed, in a cold sweat.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FAITH'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

Faith exits her apartment and heads down the hall, carrying
a wastebasket.  She opens the garbage chute, lifts up the
basket, but as she tilts it, her hand slips and a multitude
of crumpled little balls, all those days, go spilling out onto
the floor.  She just stares down at them, on the edge.  When,

               O.S.
     You need some help?

She looks up.  It's Dwayne.

               FAITH
     I do...

SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

It's on a little BRIDE AND GROOM atop a massive wedding cake,
rotating to an endless loop of "We've Only Just Begun".

               O.S.
     Okay, it's settled.

Pull back to reveal Faith on the other side of the bakery
case.

               FAITH
     This one, in vanilla.  He wants
     vanilla.

INT. CAR - EVENING

Kate and Larry are dressed up.  Driving through a
thunderstorm.

               LARRY
     This is the last one before the
     wedding, right?

               KATE
     Right.

               LARRY
     And we didn't have to bring another
     present?

               KATE
     No.

EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A party.  Champagne corks POP, MUSIC plays, GUESTS circulate.
We move around the room, picking up snatches of conversation.
Dwayne is leading Faith around by the hand.  Thrusting her
ring finger into people's faces.

She's embarrassedly playing along.

               DWAYNE
     That's right.  Six grand.  Can you
     believe what they get for these
     things?  I'm telling you, it's
     highway robbery.

He pats her ass proprietarily.

               DWAYNE
     But she's worth it.

Her mother watches, beaming.  Other elderly RELATIVES come
up to her, offering their congratulations.

               ELDERLY RELATIVE
          (sotto, to her
          mother)
     We'd almost given up hope, dear.

In another corner,

               KATE
     Not only is it tacky, it's
     exploitation.

               LARRY
     It's not exploitation.  These
     people wanna sell and I wanna buy.
     How are golf clubs exploitation?
          (to a woman nearby)
     She takes one night class and
     suddenly she's a socialist.

               KATE
     Sociologist.  And because.
          (ticking them off)
     Pawn shops are just like
     prostitutes, farm auctions and coal
     miners.  They're all for sale, but
     none of 'em would be if they
     weren't desperate for the money.

               LARRY
     We're all desperate for the money,
     doll.  That's what made this
     country great.
          (to the woman
          again)
     Back me up on this Candy, am I
     right?

               KATE
     Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate
     it when you call me doll.

               LARRY
     You used to love it when I called
     you doll.

               KATE
     You said it differently then.

                                   CUT TO:

Dwayne's got a captive audience and is holding court near the
front door.  Faith is across the room, a tray of food in her
hands.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

               DWAYNE
          (ignoring it)
     ...I'm not kidding.  All over the
     metatarsus.  Corns the size of your
     fist-- and this fungus...
          (searching)
     You know the way tuna fish looks
     when it's been in the back of the
     refrigerator for about six months?
     Anyway--

His listeners start silently returning their hors d'oeuvres
to the serving trays.  The doorbell RINGS some more.

               DWAYNE
          (to Faith)
     Honey, could you get that?  I'm
     in the middle of a story here--

Faith sets down the tray.  Goes to the door.  Outside is
Leslie.

               LESLIE
     Sorry I'm late.  I was waiting for
     a phone call.

Faith welcomes her in, introduces her to some other guests.
Larry comes over to congratulate his sister, gives her a kiss.
As he walks away,

               KATE
          (contemptuously)
     He begged me to marry him.  I
     didn't even want to marry him.

               FAITH
          (not unkindly)
     Yes you did.

               KATE
     Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't
     thought I was in love.

Off her look.

               KATE
     He tricked me.  He was really fun
     back then.  And he was so cute...
          (beat)
     How was I supposed to know that
     ten years down the road he'd turn
     out to be an idiot?

Dwayne pops his head in.

               DWAYNE
     Hon-ey, picture time.

Faith gets up to follow him.  As they go, he turns to her,

               DWAYNE
     You gonna leave your hair like
     that?

Her hair looks exactly as it has all evening.  But she's
anxiously trying to somehow rearrange it as the FLASH POPS,
and the FRAME FREEZES.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DOORWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

The party's over.  They're saying goodnight to the few
remaining guests.  The door closes one last time.  Faith
starts cleaning up, picking up plates, etc.  Dwayne's standing
in the bedroom doorway, unbuttoning his shirt, already getting
ready for bed.

               DWAYNE
     This was really nice.

               FAITH
     It was, wasn't it?

               DWAYNE
     You did a terrific job, honey.

               FAITH
          (pleased)
     Thanks.

               DWAYNE
          (putting his arms
          around her)
     And just think...  This is only
     the beginning.

He kisses her forehead.  Releases her.  Heads for the bedroom.

               DWAYNE
     Oh, sweetie, you won't forget to
     pick up my cleaning tomorrow, will
     you?

She starts to respond, but-- he's already disappeared.  A
distant roll of thunder rumbles through the room.  The
candlelight flickers.  And the rain descends.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

A sea of white, with a tiny face drowning in it.  Massive
sleeves, an enormous hoop skirt, tiers of cascading ruffles
drenched in acres of white sequins.

               FAITH
     I feel like the Good Witch of the
     North.

Kate's helping Faith try on her gown and veil.

               KATE
     Come on, it's not so bad.

               FAITH
     Look how big it makes me look.
          (she looks down)
     I look like an Alp.

               KATE
     I think it was sweet of him to pick
     it out.

               FAITH
     I know...  It was.

Kate positions the veil on her head.

               KATE
     But what?

               FAITH
          (sighing)
     Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's
     just not quite the way I always
     thought it was going to be.  You
     know, like in the movies.

               KATE
     That's the problem.  When you're
     a kid you think life is gonna be
     like the movies.  Dreams come true,
     the good guys win, people live
     happily ever after... all that
     crap.  Turn.

She turns.  Kate continues adjusting the veil, pinning it.

               KATE
     But one day you wake up and realize
     you've been had.  Of course life
     isn't like the movies.  That's why
     there are movies.

               FAITH
     Yeah.  I guess you're right.
          (beat)
     I really like the wallpaper we
     picked out for the den.

But Kate's just getting warmed up.

               KATE
     Let me tell you something about
     love.  There are no prince
     charmings, there are no glass
     slippers.  Love is hard work.

               FAITH
     I know.  You're right.

               KATE
     People have problems, insecurities,
     flaws-- and you have to learn to
     compromise, to overlook, to
     forgive.  It's not settling, Faith,
     it's life.  Real life.

Okay...

               FAITH
     I understand, Kate.
          (beat)
     What do you think of this garter?

               KATE
          (careening out of
          control)
     I mean, just how long are you going
     to cling to this childish illusion
     that it's all supposed to be
     perfect?  Well, guess what?...
     It isn't.  Not for you, not for
     anybody.

Kate slams the pins down, scattering them.  A long beat of
silence.

               FAITH
          (quietly)
     Kate, is something the matter?

               KATE
          (shakily, staring
          up at the ceiling)
     Larry brought me flowers last
     night.

               FAITH
     Is that bad?...

               KATE
     I think he's having an affair.

She buries her face in her hands.

                                   CUT TO:

They're sitting down.  Faith is handing Kate kleenex.

               FAITH
     Okay.  Now.  Have you talked to
     him about this?

Still looking down, Kate mutely shakes her head, "no".

               FAITH
     Have you seen him with someone?

               KATE
     No...  I can just tell.

               FAITH
     After all, he is my brother, and
     I know he can be kind of a jerk
     sometimes, but I know him pretty
     well, and I really don't think--

The PHONE RINGS.

               FAITH
          (reluctantly)
     Don't move.

Faith gets up and tries to head into the kitchen, but the
unfortunate combination of the big dress and the small doorway
stop her.  She tries a variety of approaches before finally
turning the hoop skirt on an angle and suspending part of it
over her head, enabling her to squeeze through the doorway
just far enough to knock the receiver off the hook and grab
it.

               FAITH
     Hello?

There's a lot of noise on the other end.

               FAITH
     Hello?  Is anybody there?

               PHONE
          (louder, over the
          noise)
     Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to
     reach Dwayne Pinsley.

               FAITH
     He's not in at the moment.  Can
     I take a message?

               PHONE
     Who's this?

               FAITH
          (trying to wrench
          herself free from
          the doorway)
     This is his fiancee.  Who's this?

               PHONE
     Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school
     buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town
     this weekend, was hoping to stop
     by and surprise him. But I've gotta
     catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm
     not gonna be able to make it.

Kate, wiping her eyes, mouths "who is it?"  Faith shakes her
head.

               FAITH
          (wanting to get
          off the phone)
     I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear
     that.  Who should I tell him
     called?

               PHONE
     My name's (lots of noise)

               FAITH
     I can hardly hear you.  Could you
     spell that?

Kate hands Faith a pencil and the back of an RSVP card.  And
letter by letter, we watch Faith scrawl out a name which, for
the second time in the movie, we realize spells "Damon
Bradley".

The receiver clatters to the floor.

               FAITH
          (dumbstruck)
     Damon Bradley...

               PHONE
     Right.  Thanks a lot.  And
     congratulations.  It's not easy
     finding love these days.

He's about to hang up.  She's shaken out of her stupor.  Grabs
the phone up off the floor.

               FAITH
     WAIT!!  Where are you?

               PHONE
     I'm at the airport.  Why?

               FAITH
     Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try
     to reach you.

               PHONE
     Well, he'd have to hurry.  My
     flight leaves at four o'clock.

She checks her watch.  It's 3:15.

               FAITH
          (like a shot)
     Where are you going?

               PHONE
     I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?

               FAITH
          (anything to keep
          him on the phone)
     Venice?  I love Venice.  With the
     boats, right?...

               PHONE
          (he's distracted)
     Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run.
     Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we
     can all get together.

Click.

               FAITH
     But wait--  Hello?  Hello??

But there is only a dial tone.  She stands there clinging
desperately to the receiver.  A woman adrift in a life raft
who's suddenly seen a ship appear, then disappear back over
the horizon.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

Faith, still in her wedding gown, is racing to her car.  A
crazed gleam in her eye.  Kate is tagging after her.

               FAITH
     It's a miracle.

               KATE
     It's a coincidence.

               FAITH
     The woman at my dry cleaners
     believes there's no such thing as
     coincidence.

Kate looks at her.  So what?

               FAITH
          (breathlessly)
     Okay, okay, but don't you think
     it's a weird coincidence?  Doesn't
     it seem like somebody's trying to
     tell me something?  And not only
     that, take a look at this...

Faith pulls a clipped copy of the day's horoscope from her
purse.  Kate scans the column.

               KATE
     Taurus: "Today can be a fresh start
     and a new beginning."
          (dropping it to
          her side)
     Come on Faith, they all say that.
     In my case it means I'm gonna empty
     the dishwasher.

She snatches back the paper, undeterred.

               FAITH
     I just want to get a look at him,
     that's all.

EXT. ROADWAY - AFTERNOON

Faith is driving like a maniac, her hoop skirt crammed in over
the edge of the dash, blocking the lower half of the
windshield.

EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone,
somehow manages to muscle the round hoop into an ellipse, and
springs out the door.

She mashes herself into one of those glass-partitioned
revolving doors, but gets stuck, making a few revolutions
before a couple of PASSERS-BY help pry her out on the other
side.

She scans a departure screen for the flight to Venice and
buttonholes a SKY CAP.  He points to the distance.

She hikes up her gown and starts sprinting through the
airport, jumping luggage, can-can-ing through the turnstiles,
dodging kids, running up the down escalator.

INT. ALITALIA CHECK-IN COUNTER - AFTERNOON

Faith flings herself across the counter.

               FAITH
          (breathlessly)
     Flight 417.  Is it still here?

The CLERK gives her the once-over.  He hasn't seen this ploy
in awhile.

               CLERK
     May I see your boarding pass,
     please?

               FAITH
     I-- I must've misplaced it.

               CLERK
     I'm sorry, but without a boarding
     pass we can't let you on the plane.

She starts digging through her purse, at the same time slowly
inching her way past the little rope they put up to block
people.

               FAITH
          (a smile)
     I'm sure I've got it here
     someplace...

He smiles back.  And tightens the rope.

               CLERK
     Great.  Because, like I said, until
     you find it, we can't let you on
     the plane.

               FAITH
          (panic rising in
          her voice)
     You don't understand.  The man I'm
     supposed to marry is on that plane.

               CLERK
     Okay, ma'am, just a moment.

He picks up his phone.

               CLERK
     Yeah, this is Mario over at
     Alitalia.
          (sotto)
     We've got a 237 on our hands here.
     Uh huh.  Yeah.  Thanks.

He hangs up.  The engines can be heard revving outside.

               CLERK
          (back to her with
          a plastic smile)
     It'll be just a moment.

We see a SECURITY GUARD approaching.  The Clerk starts waving
him over.  Meanwhile, CREW MEMBERS off an arriving flight are
entering through a side door.  Using her dress as a shield,
Faith manages to wedge a foot in it.

As the clerk turns to address the guard, she darts out and
starts sprinting across the tarmac for the plane--  where
they've just finished pulling the portable stairs away from
the cabin door.

As the plane starts to taxi, the GROUND CONTROLLER waves
frantically at her to get out of the way.  With an anguished
cry, she sinks to the ground as the jet SCREAMS overhead.

INT. AIRPORT BAR - AFTERNOON

CLOSE on a shooter of tequila.  A white-gloved hand picks it
up and downs it.  When,

               O.S.
     Okay, where's the nut in the dress?

The BARTENDER casts a sympathetic glance towards the end of
the bar.  Points.  She's a pitiful figure, this bride in her
torn wedding gown getting bombed all alone.

               SECURITY GUARD
          (taking her by the
          arm)
     Look, ma'am, we agreed not to press
     charges.  But I'm afraid we're
     gonna have to ask you to leave.

The bartender turns to her.

               BARTENDER
     Can you drive?  Do you want us to
     call you a cab?

               FAITH
          (not at all fine)
     No, thank you.  I'm fine.

She gets up shakily.

               BARTENDER
     I think we better call you a cab.
          (picking up the
          phone)
     Where is it you want to go?

Her eyes drift to the DEPARTURE SCREEN.  There's another
flight leaving for Venice in one hour.  And a sudden light
in her eyes.

Kate is on the telephone.

               KATE
     But you're afraid to fly.

INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Faith is at a pay phone.  Feeling no pain.

               FAITH
     It was my New Year's resolution
     to overcome it.

               KATE (ON PHONE)
     But it's July.

               FAITH
     It's still the new year...

               KATE (ON PHONE)
     What about your job?

               FAITH
     I have vacation time coming to me.

               KATE (ON PHONE)
     You don't have a passport.

               FAITH
     That's where you're wrong.  I got
     one nine years ago.  I just never
     had an opportunity to use it.

               KATE (ON PHONE)
     Because you were afraid to fly.

               FAITH
     Would you stop saying that?  I need
     you to do me a really big favor.

INT. KATE & LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               KATE
     Does Dwayne know about this?

               FAITH (ON PHONE)
     Of course not.  I told him I was
     going to visit a great aunt.  And
     don't tell Larry, either.

Kate glances disdainfully over at Larry, who's engrossed in
the Home Shopping Club in the next room.

               KATE
     How could I tell him?  I'm not even
     speaking to him.

EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kate and Leslie are there.  Kate knocks.  No answer.  She
pulls a key from beneath the mat and opens the door.

She calls out Dwayne's name.  No answer.  Nods to Leslie.

INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Faith, still in her bridal gown, is waiting impatiently at
the TWA terminal entrance.  Finally, she spots Kate and Leslie
in the distance, carrying a suitcase.  She rushes to them.

               FAITH
          (anxiously to
          Leslie)
     Were you able to find it?

               LESLIE
     At the very bottom of Dwayne's
     closet.

Faith clenches her fist in victory.

               LESLIE
     But...  there wasn't a regular
     yearbook picture of him in there.
     He must've been absent that day
     or something.

Faith's face falls.

               LESLIE
     However, he was in the marching
     band.

Faith brightens again, as Leslie pulls a contact lens case
from her purse.  She unscrews one side, empties the contents
into Faith's palm.  A fuzzy little image the size of an
eraserhead.  Damon Bradley, age 17, in the shadow of a tuba.
Faith holds the virtually microscopic black and white speck
up under her nose, examining it lovingly.

               FAITH
          (touched)
     Thanks, Leslie.

Then, ever so carefully, places it back into the case, puts
the case in her purse, and reaches for her suitcase.  Which
Kate is still holding onto.

               KATE
     I can't believe we did this.  Do
     I have to remind you that your
     wedding is in six days?

               FAITH
     Look, I know you think this is
     irresponsible of me, but think how
     much more irresponsible it would
     be to marry the wrong person.
               (more)

               FAITH  (Cont'd)
     What if Dwayne and I aren't really
     meant to be?  Is it fair of me to
     waste his life?

Kate reluctantly lets go.  Faith starts walking through the
terminal, pulling clothes from the suitcase.

They follow her into the ladies' room, where Faith changes
clothes.

               LESLIE
     I think she's right.  You shouldn't
     let a chance like this slip by.
     What if he's really The One?

               KATE
     Les-lie, he's not The One.  She's
     never even met this man.
          (to Faith)
     You mean to tell me that you've
     spent your whole life waiting for
     somebody with this name--
          (qualifying it)
     this name you got from a Parker
     Brothers game when you were
     eleven--

               FAITH
     No, I haven't.  And you forgot
     about the fortune teller.

               KATE
     My God, you have...

Faith hands her gown and car keys to Leslie.

               FAITH
     Thank you so much.

               KATE
     You're just going to fly to Italy
     and start combing the streets?

               FAITH
          (pulling a cocktail
          napkin from her
          purse)
     He was on his way to Venice, right?
     I called the tourist bureau and
     I must've called every hotel in
     the city, but I found where he's
     staying.
               (more)

               FAITH  (Cont'd)
          (giddy)
     And I've made a reservation.

Kate shakes her head.  They exit out of the restroom and head
towards her gate.

               KATE
     You don't even know what he looks
     like.  You don't speak the
     language.  You don't know your way
     around.  This is a total stranger,
     in a foreign land.

She's starting to get a little caught up in this.

               KATE
     A foreign land full of millions
     of Italian men...  speaking Italian
     with Italian accents and those huge
     brown eyes and that silky olive
     skin...

               FAITH
     How hard can it be?  I'll land
     there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll
     introduce myself, and--

               KATE
     Live happily ever after.

               FAITH
     Maybe.

Off Kate's look,

               FAITH
     Look, until today, I had forgotten
     all about this.  And chances are
     I'll find out he's not for me and
     I'll come home and marry Dwayne
     and never bring this up again.
     But    what if this is the real
     thing, Kate?  What if this is the
     real real thing?

She steps aboard the escalator.

               FAITH
     Wish me luck.

EXT. AIRPORT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Leslie is behind the wheel of Faith's car, driving it home.
Kate is at the wheel of her station wagon, driving it back
home.  When at the last opportunity to recircle the airport,
Kate suddenly cuts the wheel.

INT. AIRPORT WAITING AREA - NIGHT

CLOSE on a Let's Go, Italy guide, an Italian-English
Dictionary, and a copy of How to Make a Man Fall in Love with
You}.  Faith is waiting at the gate.  She's packing the books
into her suitcase when the glitter of her ENGAGEMENT RING
catches her eye.  She looks around, before furtively sliding
it off.  She opens the coin purse of her wallet and is placing
it inside, when a pair of shoes appear in front of her.

               O.S.
     Will you loan me some clothes?

Startled, she looks up.  Kate is standing there, holding her
passport.

               KATE
          (shrugs)
     I keep it in the glove compartment
     in case of emergencies.

               FAITH
     You're coming with me?

Kate nods.  Faith throws her arms around her.

               KATE
     I'm not saying I think it's a good
     idea.  But if you're going to
     insist on doing this, I don't think
     you should go alone.  You need to
     be sensible about it.

Their flight is announced.  They get up and start walking
towards the gate.

               FAITH
     You're right.  The key is to go
     about this sensibly.  Logically.
     Rationally.

As they go,

               FAITH
     Did I tell you I figured out we
     both have the same number of
     letters in our names?

INT. JET - NIGHT

As the plane slowly taxis, the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS go through
their standard litany of disaster.  As usual, everybody is
ignoring them.  Except for one passenger, who is looking
slightly green.

               KATE
     You okay?

               FAITH
     Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why
     I never did this before.  I mean,
     what's the big deal?

The plane starts picking up speed.

               FAITH
     Except for the fact that I could
     lose my job.

The landscape is beginning to blur.

               FAITH
     I could lose Dwayne.

They're rocketing down the runway.

               FAITH
          (suddenly clutching
          Kate's arm)
     I'm afraid to fly.

The ear-splitting SHRIEK of a jet engine as the plane takes
off.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARCO POLO AIRPORT, VENICE - LATE AFTERNOON

The two women enter the terminal.  Kate is jet-lagged and a
little dazed.  Faith is like a kid on Christmas morning.

               FAITH
     We're here, we're here, we're here!
     I can't believe we're really here.

As they make their way to the baggage claim they're instantly
subjected to the Italian male's tendency to treat every female
in sight as if she were the first woman he'd ever seen in his
life.  Faith looks around ingenuously,

               FAITH
     You know what?...  It seems like
     there's a lot more available men
     in Italy.

Kate rolls her eyes, grabs Faith by the elbow and steers her
out of there.

EXT. DOCKS, PIAZZALE ROMA - SUNSET

Our first view of Italy which, visually, is meant to be
idealized.  A place where the light is always golden, and the
streets are full of magic and romance.  It's not the real
Italy, it's the Italy of guidebooks.  Of memories and
dreams...

They stand at the edge of the docks which lead to the floating
city.  Faith looks around.

               FAITH
     Now what do we do?

               KATE
     The book said they have boats that
     are like taxis...
          (scans LET'S GO)
     Vaporettos.
          (looking up)
     What's the name of the place we're
     staying again?

               FAITH
          (cheerfully pulling
          out the cocktail
          napkin)
     It's called... the Gritty Palace.

               KATE
     "Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one
     of those youth hostel dives jammed
     with backpackers who don't believe
     in deodorant?

               FAITH
     I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of
     it as an adventure.

Faith spots a vaporetto.  As they dash towards it, somebody
pinches Kate.

               KATE
     Ow!  What the--

She looks behind her.  The only person in the immediate
vicinity is a NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY, looking innocent.  She WHACKS
him.

               KATE
     Cretin.

They step aboard just as the boat takes off, and Faith gazes
out into the distance, leaning out across the railing.

               FAITH
     Oh, look Kate, look how
     beautiful...

And it is...  as they sail toward the splendor that is Venice
at twilight.

EXT. THE GRAND CANAL - TWILIGHT

Magic hour.  They float past ancient pallazi, their crumbling
facades rejuvenated in the gentle evening light.  Gondoliers
glide by.  Candlelit windows cast shimmering patches of gold
down onto the water.  It's just like the movies...  Eventually
the DRIVER calls out,

               TAXI DRIVER
     Gritti Palace.

Faith can barely contain herself as they pull up alongside
one of the most elegant and expensive hotels in Venice.
Former home to Hemingway and Maugham.  Dock lanterns glow,
beckoning them into its sumptuous surroundings.

               FAITH
     This is pretty ni-iice...

Kate smiles, then realizes,

               KATE
          (grabbing Faith's
          arm)
     This is a Lifestyles hotel.

               FAITH
     What?

               KATE
     "Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which
     we are neither.  Are you out of
     your mind?  We can't afford this.

               FAITH
          (looking up at it)
     Are you sure?

               KATE
     Yes.
          (folding her arms)
     Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

               FAITH
     Well, we're here.  And more
     importantly, he's here.
          (stepping forward)
     We'll cut back on everything else.

She thanks the driver.  Pays him.  Steps off the boat.  Kate
doesn't move.

               FAITH
     Kate.  It's one night.

She still doesn't move.

               FAITH
     They take credit cards.

She's a statue.

               FAITH
     We get frequent flyer miles.

EXT. GRITTI PALACE ENTRANCE - TWILIGHT

They enter the elegant lobby of the restored 15th century
palazzo.

               FAITH
     I'm so glad I got up the nerve to
     do this.  All my life, I've waited
     for men to call.  Waited for them
     to ask me out.  Waited for them
     to make the first move.  Well, no
     more of that.  I am finally taking
     charge of my own destiny.

They arrive at the CONCIERGE's desk.

               FAITH
          (sotto)
     You ask what room he's in, okay?

               CONCIERGE
     Buona notte.

               KATE
     Hello.  Reservation for Faith
     Corbett, please.

He nods, starts punching something into his computer.  Kate
pulls something from her purse.

               KATE
     And put it on this.

CLOSE on a CREDIT CARD which reads "LAWRENCE CORBETT".  Faith
looks at her.  Kate flashes a wicked smile.

               KATE
     And, could you please tell us what
     room Mr. Bradley is in?

               CONCIERGE
          (politely)
     I'm sorry.  Mr. Bradley has already
     checked out.

The three cruelest words in existence, "already checked out".

               FAITH
          (disbelieving)
     Excuse me?

               CONCIERGE
     Mr. Bradley left about a half hour
     ago.  He said his plans had changed
     unexpectedly.  Would you prefer
     an interior or exterior room?

               FAITH
          (dazed)
     He couldn't have checked out-- I
     was supposed to meet him here.

               CONCIERGE
     I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you
     misunderstood?

He rings for the bellboy.

               FAITH
          (trying not to
          panic)
     Are you absolutely sure he's gone?
     Maybe you made a mistake.  You
     must've made a mistake.  Could you
     check again?  Please?  Sir?

His polite veneer wearing thin, the man pulls a key from the
honeycomb of slots behind him.

               CONCIERGE
     Room 217.  Would you like to go
     up and check under the bed?

She doesn't respond.  He replaces it.

               FAITH
     Well, which way did he go?

The man stares at her blankly.

               FAITH
     Nobody here has any idea which way
     he went?

               CONCIERGE
          (icily)
     Once they pay the bill, we don't
     usually follow them.

Kate leans across the counter and grabs him by the collar,
pressing her forehead to his.

               KATE
     Maybe you don't understand.
          (like she's
          possessed)
     My friend was supposed to meet him
     here.

He starts to wrestle with her.  Faith steps in to help pry
Kate's fingers from the gentleman's neck.

               FAITH
          (to him)
     Excuse us.

He's still coughing as Faith leads her away from the desk into
the lobby.

               KATE
     Well, he was rude.

They sit down.

               FAITH
     I can't believe we came all this
     way and he's gone.

               KATE
     You gave it your best shot.  You
     tried.

               FAITH
          (a whimper)
     We lost him?...

Kate nods sympathetically.

               KATE
     You wait here.  I'm gonna go get
     us a room for the night.

Devastated, Faith stares vacantly into space.

               FAITH
     I'll never meet the man of my
     dreams.

               KATE
          (to herself as she
          goes)
     You and the other 99% of the women
     in the world.

As Kate heads back toward the check-in desk, Faith gets up
and approaches the DOORMAN.  She pulls the contact lens case
from her purse.  Unscrews one side and holds it out in front
of him.  He starts laughing.  She darkens.  He sobers, rattles
something off in Italian, gesturing toward the distance.

EXT. STREETS OF VENICE - NIGHT

The two women race along, over bridges, under streetlamps.
Faith is holding the case out in front of her sister-in-law.

               FAITH
     Just once more, so you'll be sure
     to know what to look for.

               KATE
     Faith, I've seen it already, okay?
     If I spot somebody who's got a head
     that's an eighth of an inch around,
     standing underneath a tuba, I'll
     recognize him from the photo.
     Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's
     not gonna do me any good.

Faith starts stopping people on the street, holding out the
case, encouraging them to peer in.  Some of them look at her
like she's nuts, a few shake their heads, one MAN finally
stops.  Examines it carefully.

               FAITH
          (anxiously)
     Did you see him?  Do you recognize
     him?

               TOURIST
          (looking up,
          smiling)
     Candid Camera, right?
          (he starts waving)
     Where is it?

She snatches it away.  Continues on.  But the crowd jostles
her.  She is bumped hard from behind.  And the photo goes
floating out into St. Mark's Square.  Frantically, she gets
down on her hands and knees, trying to keep people from
trampling it.

               KATE
     What are you doing?

               FAITH
          (without looking
          up)
     He fell out.

Reluctantly, Kate gets down on all fours, too.  Faith spots
the little face lying about two feet away.  She strains to
reach out, when a SHOE mashes down on her hand.  It lifts back
up, taking the photo with it, stuck fast to the sole.

Faith struggles to her feet, scooting after the MAN who's
moving at a fast clip.  She fights her way through the crowd,
tracing his footsteps, crouched to make sure it's still there.

He's heading toward the edge of the canal.  Is about to step
aboard a gondola, when Faith stands up and grabs his shoulder
from behind.  He turns.

               FAITH
          (breathlessly)
     Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but I
     think there's something that
     belongs to me stuck to the bottom
     of your shoe.

Confused, the guy looks down.  Faith reaches for his foot.

               FAITH
     Do you mind if I just--

She takes the shoe, turns it over, twisting the man's leg and
knocking him off balance in the process.  Sending him toppling
into the water.

               FAITH
          (peering down from
          above)
     Oh, I'm sorry...

But the shoe is still in her hand.  She turns it over, and
sure enough, the tiny image is still perched there.  She licks
a finger and triumphantly picks it up like a crumb.
Success...  Until a big gust of wind comes up, whisking the
little likeness into the Grand Canal.

INT. GRITTI PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT

A puddle of water is forming on the marble floor.

               O.S.
     It wasn't like I did it on purpose.

Faith is dripping.  Looking like her world has come to an end.
She's holding a phone book, as Kate drops tokens into a pay
phone.

               KATE
     You can't really blame him for
     being upset.  It was an Armani
     suit.

               FAITH
     Did I or did I not offer to have
     it cleaned?

               KATE
     I don't think he understood what
     you were saying.  What's the
     airport number?

A MAID walks by, wheeling a cart.  Suddenly, Faith's eyes
light up.

               FAITH
     No...

She takes the receiver from Kate's hand, hangs it up.

               KATE
     I just got a dial tone--

               FAITH
     The guy at the desk said he only
     left about a half hour ago, right?

               KATE
     So?

               FAITH
     So, maybe his room hasn't been
     cleaned yet.  Maybe there's
     something in there that might help
     us.  Maybe they'll let us go in
     and take a look around.

They both turn to look at the concierge.  Look back at each
other.  Shake their heads.  Kate picks up the phone again.
Faith takes it from her, hangs it up again.  Looks pleadingly
at her friend.  Beat.

               KATE
     I am not breaking into anybody's
     room.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

A wad of LIRE changes hands, as a MAID opens the door to room
217.

INT. ROOM 217 - NIGHT

It hasn't been cleaned.  In fact, it looks like a cyclone hit
it.

               KATE (O.S.)
     So far, I'd say we're looking for
     a rich slob.

Kate stands with her hands on her hips, surveying the scene.
Faith spots a wastebasket in the corner.  She runs over to
it, picks it up, peers in.

               FAITH
     Ah ha!...

               KATE
     What'd you find?

               FAITH
          (charmed)
     A Butterfinger wrapper.

               KATE
     A rich, possibly fat, slob.

               FAITH
          (hopeful)
     Maybe there's fingerprints on it?

               KATE
     We're not looking to arrest the
     man, Faith, we're trying to locate
     him.

               FAITH
     Oh.  Right.

She drops it.  Starts digging through the wastebasket again.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

A small pile of garbage spread out on the floor -- an apple
core, a couple more Butterfinger wrappers, some tissue, an
empty shampoo bottle, a soap wrapper.  Nothing very helpful.
There's only one more crumpled piece of paper yet to be
examined.

               FAITH
     This our last hope.

She says a silent prayer.  Unfolds it.

               FAITH
     We're saved!

               KATE
     What is it?

               FAITH
          (saints be praised)
     A phone message.
          (beat)
     Only--

               KATE
     Only what?

               FAITH
     Only, it's in Italian...

                                   CUT TO:

CLOSE ON the phone message and a hand holding it.

               O.S.
          (impatiently)
     So what is this?  He owes you
     money?

Pan up to the annoyed Concierge.

               FAITH
     No...  it's just very important
     that I find him, okay?

               CONCIERGE
     Why?

               FAITH
     Because.

Beat.

               KATE
     Look, it's very simple.  When she
     was eleven years old, she got this
     name--

Faith elbows her.

               FAITH
          (suddenly choking
          up)
     He's my brother.

Kate looks at her.

               FAITH
          (holding back
          tears)
     Yes, my long-lost brother.  See,
     uh, we were separated when we were
     very young.  The last time I saw
     him we were just babies, but I've
     recently found out that he's here
     in Italy.  And I'm here trying to
     find him.

That's the ticket.

               FAITH
     You could say I'm sort of looking
     for my other half.

She smiles nervously.

               KATE
     And she's going to be married in
     five days, and it would mean so
     much to her if she could find him
     before her wedding day.

Teary-eyed, Faith nods.

               FAITH
          (pleading)
     All I ask is that you just call
     this number and ask if they know
     him, if they have any idea where
     we might find him.

He looks at her.

               CONCIERGE
     And then you promise you'll go
     away?

She nods energetically.

                                   CUT TO:

FINGERS DIALING.  As she and Kate wait,

               KATE
          (sotto)
     Your brother?

               FAITH
     What was I gonna do?  Tell him the
     truth?

               CONCIERGE
          (into phone)
     Ai Monasteri?
          (beat)
     Va bene.

He's on hold.

               KATE
     A monastery?

Faith is looking stricken.

               CONCIERGE
          (coolly)
     It's a store.  In Rome.

She heaves a sigh of relief.  He goes back to the call.

               CONCIERGE
     Si.  Sto cercando Damon Bradley?...
          (beat)
     Si.  Si.  Grazie.  Ciao.

Hangs up.  They look at him expectantly.

               CONCIERGE
          (handing back the
          message)
     He said he thinks a woman he works
     with knows him.  Her name's Anna.
     But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.

               FAITH
     So.  How do we get to Rome?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SUNRISE

Somewhere in Tuscany.  Where the landscape looks like one of
those old Renaissance paintings.  Undulating hills,
sun-dappled olive groves, vast vineyards, crumbling
farmhouses.  They speed into the frame aboard a vespa.  Faith
is at the handlebars.

               KATE
          (over the wind)
     Couldn't we just have taken a
     train?

               FAITH
          (shaking her head)
     The book said they have a lot of
     rail strikes in Italy.

               FAITH
     This way we're in control.
     Besides, look how pretty this is.
     We're really getting to see the
     countryside.

They speed off.  And a BUG smacks straight into Kate's mouth.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER.  The front wheel of the vespa is rotating very slowly.
That's because they're pushing it.  In silence, until,

               FAITH
          (quietly)
     I told you a liter was less than
     a gallon.

               KATE
          (snapping)
     We would've had enough gas to get
     us there if you hadn't gotten us
     lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less
     than a mile.

               FAITH
     Right.  So we should've been able
     to cover more of them.

Silence.

               KATE
     Boy, we sure are seeing the
     countryside, alright.

Beat.

               KATE
     I'm hungry.

               FAITH
     You know, no offense or anything
     Kate, but I think I'm starting to
     see Larry's side of the story.

               KATE
     What's that supposed to mean?...

               FAITH
     Nothing.

They plod along again in silence.

               FAITH
          (throwing up her
          hands)
     I thought all roads were supposed
     to lead there anyway.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER STILL.  They've stopped to rest.  The sun is beating
down mercilessly.

Faith gets up, stands at the side of the road, arm and thumb
extended.

               KATE
     I don't know that we should be
     accepting any rides from strangers.

Faith just looks at her.

               FAITH
     You expecting somebody you know?

               KATE
     Well, you don't have to get snippy
     with me.

               FAITH
     Sorry.

After a beat,

               KATE
          (wounded)
     So, what exactly is Larry's side
     of the story, anyway?

               FAITH
     I don't know, Kate.  I just said
     that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on
     edge.
          (gazing into the
          distance)
     I'm afraid we're losing him.

               KATE
          (staring vacantly
          ahead)
     You think he misses me at all?

               FAITH
     'Course he does.

               KATE
     You know, when Larry and I got
     married, I thought we were so lucky
     we found each other so early.
     People talk about spending their
     lives together, how many of them
     really get to?  But maybe I was
     wrong.  Maybe sooner or later
     everything wears out.

Faith turns to look at her sister-in-law.  She goes over and
kneels down next to her.

               FAITH
     Remember in junior high, when I
     had that Halloween party?  And we
     were playing Twister.  And it
     landed on right-hand-red, and there
     was only one red spot left.  You
     reached for  it, but you started
     to fall.

               FAITH
     And instead of taking it, Larry
     reached out to catch you.  He let
     you win.  Larry never let anybody
     win.  That's when I knew.  He was
     a goner.

Kate is idly doodling in the dirt with a twig.

               KATE
     That was a long time ago.

               FAITH
     And you know what I thought then,
     Kate?  I thought, I hope someday
     I have somebody who loves me that
     much.
          (a confession)
     I still hope that.

Still looking down, Kate smiles ruefully.

               KATE
     That you'll find someone who'll
     let you win at Twister?

She looks up, eyes full of doubt.  Faith nods solemnly.

               KATE
     He went out and bought himself
     men's cologne the other day.  Did
     I tell you that?

               FAITH
          (concerned)
     Larry bought himself cologne?

               KATE
     Polo.

Uh-oh.

Faith puts a consoling arm around her, and they sit there in
the Tuscan countryside.  In quiet contemplation of the
capriciousness of life and love.

INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY

Dwayne and Larry are playing.  Larry's clothes are very
wrinkled.

               LARRY
     So, she just takes off on me.  No
     warning.  No explanation.  Just
     this message on the machine, "I'm
     leaving you.  Take the clothes out
     of the dryer."  I mean, what'd I
     do?

Larry smacks the ball.

               DWAYNE
     I don't get it.  She hasn't seen
     her since she was a kid, now just
     because she's dying, all of the
     sudden she's gotta see her again?

               LARRY
     She's been acting weird lately,
     though.  I shoulda seen it coming.
     Babbling on and on and on about
     "communication".  Like I don't know
     how to communicate.

               DWAYNE
     Let's face it.  Sooner or later
     we all die.

               LARRY
     Exactly.

After a beat, Larry stops the ball.

               LARRY
     Who's dying?

               DWAYNE
     Your great aunt.

               LARRY
     What great aunt?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD IN TUSCANY - DAY

They're walking again, both holding thumbs out now.  And their
prayers are answered.  A bright red FERRARI comes screeching
to a halt about ten feet in front of them.  They exchange a
look.  Faith dashes towards it.  Peers in the window,
converses with the driver a moment, then waves Kate over.

               KATE
          (lugging the
          suitcase)
     You really think this is safe?

An interior shot of the car reveals a NUN behind the wheel.

               FAITH
     I'd say so...

Kate takes a look inside,

               KATE
     God, the Catholic Church is even
     richer than I thought.

She climbs in, and the car PEELS OUT.

EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY

The Ferrari zips into the Eternal City.  A wonderland of color
and history.

Baroque fountains spout cool, clear water; kids play soccer
in the ruins; lovers kiss in secluded corners; elegantly
stylish men and women sip espresso in sidewalk cafes, engaged
in conversations, flirtations, negotiations.  All the world's
a stage.

They screech to an abrupt halt directly in front of,

               SISTER MARGHERITA
     Ai Monasteri.

They get out and are still thanking her profusely, standing
at the side of the car with suitcase in hand, when there is
a whisper from behind,

               O.S.
     Do you believe in love at first
     sight?

Faith freezes.  Gazes heavenward.

               FAITH
          (like an oath)
     Yes.

She turns.  To discover that God is a practical joker.  The
guy is talking to Kate.  Slicked back hair, ponytail, a lot
of leather.  He looks awfully young.

               KATE
     I'm married.

               YOUNG ITALIAN STUD
          (good-naturedly)
     I know, I saw your ring.  This is
     no problem.  I only want for us
     to be friends.

Uh huh.

               YOUNG ITALIAN STUD
     I am Giovanni.

He kisses Kate's hand.

               GIOVANNI
     And you are?...

               KATE
          (in spite of
          herself)
     Kate.

               GIOVANNI
     You are looking for a place to
     stay, no, Kate?

               KATE
     No.  Well, I don't know.  Well,
     maybe.  Later.

               GIOVANNI
     This is your most lucky day.  My
     family runs a pension not three
     blocks from here.

What a coincidence.  She looks at Faith.  In spite of herself,
she's a little charmed, flattered by him.  As they continue
up the steps,

               GIOVANNI
          (suggestively)
     I wait here for you.

INT. AI MONASTERI - DAY

Inside, a hushed environment, reminiscent of a monastery.
The store sells liqueurs, etc. made by monks.  Faith
approaches the counter, behind which one of those inordinately
fashionable Italian WOMEN is positioned.

               FAITH
          (almost whispering)
     Hello.  Uh, do you speak English?

               WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER
          (demure smile)
     A little.

               FAITH
     Thank God.  I'm looking for Anna?

               WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER
     I am Anna.

Overjoyed, Faith extends a hand.

               FAITH
     Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know
     how happy I am to meet you.  You
     see, I'm trying to find someone,
     and--

               KATE
          (perusing the
          merchandise)
     Her brother.

               FAITH
     Right.  My brother.

               ANNA
          (sweetness and
          light)
     Your brother.  Fratello tuo.

               FAITH
     Yes.  Right.  Si.  My fratello.
     And, I was thinking that maybe
     someone here, well, you, might know
     him.  His name is Damon Bradley?...

The woman's eyes narrow.

               ANNA
     Damon Bradley.

               FAITH
          (more thrilled)
     Yes.  You do know him?

Anna slams her espresso down on the counter.

               ANNA
     E' un porco!

               FAITH
     Excuse me?

She starts ranting in Italian.  Faith pulls out her dictionary
and starts flipping frantically through it.  Kate comes over
with a handful of little bottles.

               KATE
     What did you say to her?

               FAITH
          (still flipping)
     I don't know.  I just asked her
     if she knew him and all of the
     sudden--

               KATE
     What's she saying?

Faith shoots her a look.

               KATE
     Oh.
          (beat)
     Wait a minute--

Kate rushes to the door,

               KATE
     Hey, Giovanni...

He comes running.  Kate hustles him inside and over to Faith.

               KATE
          (to him)
     My friend is looking for her
     brother and she thinks this woman
     knows where he is.  Can you tell
     us what she's saying?

               GIOVANNI
     She's saying he's a-- a--
          (snapping his
          fingers, he can't
          think of the word)
     porco.

               KATE
     A porco?

               GIOVANNI
          (then suddenly)
     A pig!  A pig!
          (to Faith,
          apologetic)
     She's saying he's a pig.

Anna's starting to throw things.

               GIOVANNI
     A very large pig.

               FAITH
     Ask her if she knows where he is?

               GIOVANNI
     Sa dov'e' lui?

She screams for about a minute.  He turns to Faith.

               GIOVANNI
     No.

               FAITH
     Ask her if she knows how I might
     reach him?  If she has a telephone
     number?

               GIOVANNI
     Ha un numero di telefono?

She yells some more.

               GIOVANNI
     She did, but she...

She rips a napkin into shreds.

               GIOVANNI
     ...misplaced it.

More yelling.

               GIOVANNI
     He thinks she's going to meet him
     at Mezzaluna tonight, but she--

               ANNA
     HAH!

She hits her inner elbow with the edge of her other hand, in
the Italian version of the finger.

               GIOVANNI
     ...has a prior commitment.

               FAITH
     What's mezzaluna?

               GIOVANNI
     A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.

               FAITH
          (ecstatic)
     That's it.  That's it.  That's all
     I need to know.
          (to her and
          Giovanni)
     Bless you, thank you, thank you.

The PROPRIETOR rushes in from the back of the store, makes
her apologize to the nice customers.

               ANNA
          (grudgingly)
     Sorry.

               PROPRIETOR
          (that's better)
     Cosi va bene.

As Faith heads toward the door, she yells after her,

               ANNA
     I'm sorry your brother is a pig!

               KATE
          (with the bottles)
     Who is it I pay for these?

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. AI MONASTERI - MOMENTS LATER

As they emerge from the shop and head down the stairs, Kate
is looking skeptical.

               FAITH
     All that proves is that she wasn't
     the woman who was meant for him.

Faith throws her arms around her in celebration, dancing in
the street.

               FAITH
     And now we know where he's gonna
     be.

EXT. PENSION - AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON a sign, "PENSIONE DIVINO AMORE".  Giovanni is helping
them carry their things into the hotel.  He leads them to
their room, opens the door.  Faith enters.  As Kate follows,
he momentarily pulls her aside,

               GIOVANNI
          (apologetically)
     I must leave town for two days.
     Was unavoidable.  But, day after
     tomorrow,
          (with import)
     I return...

He places the key in her hand.  Holding his own there longer
than necessary.

INT. PENSIONE ROOM - LATER

Faith is in the shower.  Kate's got an Italian smorgasbord
arrayed before her.  Is browsing "How to Make a Man, etc.".

EXT. PENSION - EVENING

They're on their way out the door, dressed to the nines.  As
Kate turns their key in to the desk, Giovanni whispers in her
ear,

               GIOVANNI
     Forty-eight hours...

Nods meaningfully.

EXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT

They emerge from a cab into a dreamlike landscape, illuminated
by the lights Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers and the
strolling FIRE-EATERS performing in the piazza.  Everything
seems to be moving in slow motion.

               FAITH
     All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind
     of nervous.
          (wringing her
          hands)
     God, I hate blind dates.  Why
     couldn't we just have arranged
     marriages in America?

               KATE
     You're right.  At least that way
     you could spend the rest of your
     life blaming your parents instead
     of yourself.  Smile.

Faith smiles.  And they enter the restaurant -- a sea of
frescoes, flowers, crystal and silver, all awash in
candlelight.  "Some Enchanted Evening..."

From Faith's POV we see various and sundry men acknowledge
or appear oblivious to her expectant face.  A smile here, a
glance there.  He could be any of them.  Or none of them.

               FAITH
          (through her smile)
     Let's get a drink.

They take a seat at the bar.  Unbeknownst to them, an
extremely handsome MAN at a table on the terrace is eying them
intently.

               KATE
     Aren't you going to ask the
     maitre'd if he's here?

It's all come down to this.  A whole lifetime of waiting,
searching, hoping...

               FAITH
          (suddenly chicken)
     I sort of wanted to wait to see
     if maybe he'd notice me first?

               KATE
     You've travelled over six thousand
     miles and now you're gonna play
     hard to get?

The MAN from the terrace is getting up.  Is coming their way.
Kate elbows her.  "Some Enchanted Eeeevening"...

               KATE
          (sotto)
     He's a god.

He approaches.

               ADONIS
     Excuse me, I hope you don't think
     I'm being too forward.  I'm here
     waiting for a friend, but I
     couldn't help noticing the two of
     you.

Faith is giddily kicking Kate under the table, but no words
are coming out.  Kate steps in.

               KATE
     We noticed you, too.

It's really happening.

               ADONIS
     I was wondering if you might be
     persuaded to join me--

It really is...

               KATE
          (getting up)
     We'd love to.

               ADONIS
          (extending a hand)
     Great.  I'm Guiseppe Romano.

Faith's face falls.

                                   CUT TO:

They're back at the bar by themselves.

               KATE
     So what's in a name?  I wanna join
     him.  I don't see why we can't join
     him.

               FAITH
     I told you.  If he sees me here
     with another guy, he's gonna think
     I'm here with another guy.  I just
     don't want to send any confusing
     signals.

Kate glances back over at him.  Waves.

               KATE
          (to Faith)
     Well, how come we're always looking
     for guys for you?

               FAITH
     Because I'm the one who's single.

               KATE
          (sulking)
     I never even got to be single.

               FAITH
     Sure you did.

               KATE
     Not if you don't count the sixth
     grade.

               FAITH
     Okay, okay.  You join him.  But
     first will you ask if he's here?

We watch from a distance as Kate gets up and approaches the
MAITRE'D.  He gestures towards a booth on the other side of
the room.  She thanks him and makes a beeline back to the bar.

               KATE
     He's heeeeeerrre...

               FAITH
          (nervously looking
          around)
     Oh my God.  Where?

               KATE
     He's sitting in the fourth booth
     down, on the left hand side, with
     his back to us.  He's wearing a
     navy jacket.  If you turn around,
     you can see part of his right
     elbow.

               FAITH
          (not moving a
          muscle)
     Is he looking at us?

               KATE
          (glancing over her
          shoulder)
     Nope.

Faith tries to peek around without being too obvious.  And
slips off her bar stool, almost knocking over the drink of
the person next to her.  She grabs it, awkwardly climbs back
onto the stool.  Then pulls out a compact and checks out the
view.

               FAITH
          (like she's twelve)
     Oooooo, I can see his sleeve...

After a beat.

               FAITH
     I guess I should just go over and
     introduce myself, huh?

Kate nods.  Faith puts the mirror away.  Starts to get up.

               FAITH
          (sitting back down)
     Who do I say I am?

                                   CUT TO:

Moments later.  Having gotten her story straight.  She gets
up again.

               FAITH
     Right, right...  Okay..
          (suddenly seized
          with self-doubt)
     You don't think he's gonna think
     I'm too aggressive?

               KATE
     Faith.  So far you've trailed the
     man halfway around the globe.  At
     this point, I don't think another
     fifteen feet is gonna tip the
     scales.

               FAITH
     Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be
     right?
          (a deep breath)
     This is it.

She straightens her skirt.  Starts to walk toward him again,
when,

               KATE
     Faith--

               FAITH
          (turning anxiously)
     What?

               KATE
     Good luck.

Faith smiles gratefully back at her.  Kate motions, "go on"...
Then turns back towards Guiseppe. Faith collects herself.
A woman with a mission.  Begins striding purposefully towards
him.

Focused only on that special arm as, with each step, a little
more of it comes into view.

Only a few more feet.  There is nothing between her and him
now but that WAITER with the enormous tray of pasta coming
from the other direction.  But, alas...  In a collision worthy
of inclusion in the "agony of defeat", the tray and all its
contents go sliding down over her.  All eyes turn her way,
and she stands there, paralyzed in an agonizing moment of dead
silence.  Then, with an anguished howl, she dashes to the
ladies room.  Kate gets up and goes rushing in after her.
And, back out in the restaurant, a pair of feet get up and
step gingerly over the remains of somebody's angel hair pasta.

Seconds later, with an enormous wet orange spot on her dress,
Faith bursts out of the ladies room.  And discovers he's gone.

The women bolt out the door, just in time to glimpse a man
in a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the
distance.  In hot pursuit, Faith flings off her heels and
sends them flying.  One of them BONKS a PASSER-BY, another
MAN clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket, on the
head.  We may get only a brief look at this guy, but it's
enough to establish that while he may not be drop-dead
gorgeous, any woman with any sense wouldn't kick him out of
bed for munching saltines either.   There's an undeniable
warmth in his eyes.

But Faith doesn't see him at all, because as he bends down
to pick up her shoe, he disappears from sight in the crowd,
and she races madly past him.  Down the subway stairs, into
the tunnel-- and into a mob.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

She battles her way through the throng, hopping up and down
to try to get an overview, but there is no sign of him.  She
dashes from car to car, pounding on windows, calling out his
name.  Until, in a sudden whoosh, the doors close, and the
train speeds off into the night.

But she's still running after it.  Desperately.  Until it
finally vanishes around a corner, out of sight.  And she sinks
to the ground, arms outstretched in the darkness...  in vain.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT

CLOSE ON an abandoned shoe.  A hand picks it up.

               KATE (O.S.)
     I found one.

The two of them are wandering the piazza.  Faith puts the shoe
back on and, with one bare foot, limps over to a table.  Her
dress is stained, her nylons are run, a few stray noodles
still cling to her hair.  Basically, she's a disaster.

As they sit down,

               KATE
     Well, nobody can say we didn't try.

               FAITH
          (not hearing this)
     Okay, here's what I think.  We
     find out what all the subway stops
     for that train are-- the subway
     system's really not that big in
     Rome, we could narrow it down and--

               KATE
          (not believing
          this)
     And then what, Faith?

               FAITH
     And then... we rent a truck, or
     a car, either one, and we set up
     a loudspeaker, and we drive through
     the surrounding areas, and we page
     him.

Simple as that.  Kate just stares at her, dumbfounded.

               FAITH
     What?...  My hair?

When,

               O.S.
     I like the style.  I just don't
     think this color works for me.

They look up.  It's the STRANGER in white with her other shoe
in his hand.

               FAITH
     Oh.
          (reaching for it)
     Thank you.

               DAMON
     Allow me.

He kneels down and places the shoe on her foot.  Then gazes
up into her eyes.

               FAITH
     Thanks very much.
          (back to Kate)
     So what do you think?

Kate looks at him.  Kind of charmed.

               KATE
     That was really sweet...

               FAITH
     I meant about my idea.

               KATE
     I think it's time we got some
     professional help.

               FAITH
          (nodding)
     Like a detective.

               KATE
     No... Like a psychiatrist.

               FAITH
          (looking around)
     Don't be silly.  How's a
     psychiatrist gonna find him?

He's still kneeling there.

               FAITH
          (to him again)
     Thank you.

Now go away.  He sits down at a table nearby.  Stares over
at Faith.  She spots an Italian policeman, or CARABINIERE,
standing at the edge of the piazza.

               FAITH
     I'm gonna go see what I can find
     out about speaker rental.

She gets up, the STRANGER gets up, as if to follow.  She looks
at him like he's nuts.

               FAITH
     Excuse me.

Steps around him to head toward the cop.  He sits back down.

               DAMON
          (to Kate)
     So, what's the story with your
     friend?

               KATE
          (watching her in
          amazement)
     My friend has lost her fucking
     mind...

               DAMON
     What's she doing?

Kate turns to him,

               KATE
     She's trying to find out where she
     can rent a loudspeaker.

               DAMON
     What for?

               KATE
     So she can drive through the
     streets of Rome paging the man of
     her dreams.

He laughs.

               DAMON
     No, really.  What's she doing?

               KATE
     Really.  She thinks he's here.
     Even though she's never met him.
     Even though she's never laid eyes
     on him.

               DAMON
          (still not
          believing her)
     Seriously.

Kate just looks at him.

               DAMON
     Oh.  Well, what's wrong with that?

He gazes over at her, gesticulating wildly in the distance.

               DAMON
     Only... if she's never met this
     guy, what makes her think he's
     perfect for her?

Kate just shakes her head.  Don't ask.

               DAMON
     Were they pen pals?

               KATE
     No.

               DAMON
     Is he some kind of celebrity or
     something?

               KATE
     No.

               DAMON
     Did he do some anonymous good deed
     for her?

An exasperated sigh.

               KATE
     She got his name off a Ouija board
     when she was eleven.

She holds out her palms.  What can I tell you?

A beat.  Then,

               DAMON
     What is his name?...

Faith comes trudging back, in tears.

               FAITH
     He said it would take at least six
     months to get a permit for a
     loudspeaker.  And, you have to get
     the Pope to approve it.

Defeated, she picks up her purse.

               FAITH
     Let's just go.

Kate puts her arm around her and they start walking.  The
STRANGER grabs his jacket off the back of his chair.  Tags
after them.

               DAMON
          (anxiously)
     Will you be staying in Rome long?

She doesn't respond.

               DAMON
     Your friend said you were looking
     for someone?
          (at her side)
     Maybe I can help you track him
     down.  I speak a little Italian.
     And I have a friend who works at
     the embassy.  Maybe we could--

She's trying to wave down a TAXI.

               FAITH
     Thank you, but I really don't want
     any help.

               DAMON
     What's his name?  I'll look into
     it for you.  I could give you a
     call.

A CAB slows to a stop in front of them.

               FAITH
     Look, I appreciate the offer, but--

She reaches for the door.  He's standing in the way.

               DAMON
     Just tell me his name...

She blows her nose noisily.

               FAITH
          (to get rid of him)
     Damon Bradley.

He stares at her.

               DAMON
          (stunned)
     But, that's-- I'm Damon Bradley...

Still wiping her nose, she notices the jacket in his hands,
then looks up into his eyes.  The wind rustles through the
trees.

               FAITH
     You're...

He nods.  Amazed.

               FRANCESCA
     And you're the biggest mess I've
     ever seen.

She reaches for her hair.

               FRANCESCA
     I find that very attractive.

And she faints.  Dead away.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Having regained consciousness, Faith is across a candlelit
table from him.  They're engrossed in conversation.  In each
others' eyes.  Tables around them have all emptied.  A waiter
in the background is trying to prop his eyes open.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     ...Coming so close and yet just
     missing each other.  Do you know
     what I mean?

Does she know what he means...

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     There's this poem by Rilke, I don't
     remember the whole thing, but it's
     about that.  About waiting for that
     person, and wondering if you'll
     ever find them.  And the last line
     of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps
     the same bird echoed through both
     of us, yesterday--

               FAITH
     --separate, in the evening..."

               DAMON'S MOTHER
          (slowly,
          spellbound)
     Yes.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE.   To the Beatles' "I Will"

PENSION DIVINO AMORE - Faith hops out Damon's car.  He waits.
She dashes inside, practically skipping.

Moments later, having changed clothes, floats back out and
they take off again.  Up above, Kate watches wistfully out
the window.

DRY CLEANERS - Dwayne is there trying to pick up his stuff.
The CLERK is holding out a ticket.  "You have to have one of
these."

THE FORUM - The sun is coming up over the ruins.  Faith and
Damon stroll through them.  Damon pulls out a "doggie bag".
Sets down a little container of pasta for the wild cats that
roam Rome.

McDONALDS - Rome's golden arches.  Kate is munching on a Big
Mac, and working on a postcard:  "Dear Larry,".  Somebody
cruises by her table, snakes out a hand, reaching for her
purse.  Without so much as an upward glance, she flicks out
a leg and trips him.

CAMPO DEI FIORI MARKET - The enormous outdoor market where
everything from orchids, to watermelon, to live eels and
octopus are in abundant display.  Damon buys Faith a gardenia.
She puts it in her hair.

GIOLITTI - A gelateria.  Kate's eating ice cream.  Still
working on the postcard:  "Dear Larry".  Nothing more.
Finally crumples it up.

THE SPANISH STEPS -  Faith and Damon are sitting on the edge
of the steps watching the street show that is Rome, when a
LOCAL approaches with a Polaroid.  Selling pictures.  They
pose.

               FAITH
     My hair's kind of a mess, isn't
     it?

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Your hair... is perfect.

He leans in and kisses her.  And from this angle, except for
the clothes, they look an awful lot like Rodin's version, as
the FRAME FREEZES.

CLOSE on the photo.  She looks up from it.

               FAITH
     You don't think this is just
     infatuation, do you?

               FRANCESCA
     Oh no.
          (beat)
     Do you?

               FAITH
     No.

He takes her hand.  Both a little unnerved, they walk.  Until,

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     But...  just to be sure, maybe we
     ought to shatter each other's
     unrealistic images of perfection.
     You know, each of us admit
     something embarrassing about
     ourselves.

               FAITH
     Okay.  Good idea.  You first.

               FRANCESCA
     Me first?  Alright, well,
          (beat)
     Something embarrassing, right?
     Something we don't want to admit
     in public.

She nods.  He thinks a moment.  Then,

               FRANCESCA
          (sheepish)
     I'm a liberal.

She looks at him with amazement.

               FAITH
     I'm a liberal!

               FRANCESCA
          (disbelieving)
     No...

               FAITH
          (solemnly)
     My car bumper has never held a
     winning sticker.

They gaze deeply at one another.

               FRANCESCA
     Well, as long we both know we're
     going into this with our eyes wide
     open...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. VIA MARGUTTA - TWILIGHT

A lantern-lit street of 18th century facades.  A faint breeze
stirs the trees above.  Strains of opera float out a window.
Faith is looking around.  Finally, though they're not
overlooking anything,

               FAITH
     You're right.  This is a really
     pretty view.

He smiles.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Not this.

He leads her out to the center of the street.  Tilts his head
back.  She follows and they walk, with their necks craned
back, like two drunken sailors, like two kids.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     This...

And up above, in the houses and apartments lining either side
of the street, visible through the unshuttered windows, are
gilded ceilings and candlelit vaults of angels.  And beyond
those, the star-studded, indigo summer sky.
     It's all a matter of how you look
     at it.

INT. PENSION BAR - NIGHT

Kate's down at the bar, talking to the Italian BARTENDER.

               KATE
     So, you're saying you think I
     should call him.

He draws a beer.

               BARTENDER
     He is your husband, no?

               KATE
     Yes, but...  He was having an
     affair.

               BARTENDER
     Si.

So what?  He picks up a napkin and sets the glass down on it.

               KATE
     The point is, he was sleeping with
     another woman.

Beat.

               BARTENDER
     Uh huh.

How much clearer can she make it?

               KATE
     They were having sex.

Finally, it dawns on him.

               BARTENDER
          (nodding gravely)
     She was your sister.

               KATE
     No, she wasn't my sister.

               BARTENDER
          (shaking his head
          in sympathy)
     Your mother.

               KATE
     Of course not.

               BARTENDER
          (another stab)
     Your grandmother?

               KATE
     Look, she wasn't a relative, okay?
     I don't know who she is.

Big deal.  He rolls his eyes and dismisses it with a wave of
his hand.

               KATE
     So, how much longer 'til Giovanni
     gets back?

EXT. THE TREVI FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

It's all lit up.  And deserted at this late hour.  The water
glows, ethereal blue.  They sit at the edge, bare feet
dangling in.  Damon picks up one of her shoes.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     I think I'll have it bronzed.

She smiles.  Then sobers.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     What?...

               FAITH
     I feel like I've been wandering
     in the desert for as long as I can
     remember.  With nothing but
     emptiness around me, wind and
     sun...  And suddenly, out of the
     blue, somehow I've found the oasis.

He takes her face in his hands.  Solemnly, almost mystically,
kisses her eyes... her mouth...

Until,

               FAITH
     There is one other thing you should
     know about me.

               FRANCESCA
     Nothing you could say would change
     the way I feel.

               FAITH
     I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be
     married in two days.

               FRANCESCA
     Except possibly that.

She gets up.  Heavy with guilt.

               FAITH
     And, he's a friend of yours.  It's
     Dwayne.

               FRANCESCA
     Dwayne?

               FAITH
     Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school.
     That's how I knew you were here.
     When you called, from the airport.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Oh, right.  Dwayne.
          (beat)
     You're engaged to Dwayne?

               FAITH
          (like she's trying
          to explain an
          affair)
     It just happened.  I didn't plan
     it.  I was alone.  And he was...
     there.  But now everything's
     changed.  I owe it to him to let
     him know.  I need to tell him.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     You're sure...

               FAITH
     I've never been more sure of
     anything in my life.

He smiles.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Good.

               FAITH
     Let's find a telephone.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Sure-- But, before you do that,
     since we're putting all our cards
     on the table, I have a confession
     to make, too.

She pauses,

               FAITH
     Okay.

He looks at her worriedly.

               FAITH
     Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     You're sure...

               FAITH
     We found each other, didn't we?

               DAMON'S MOTHER
          (hesitantly)
     Yes.  We did.

               FAITH
          (a whisper)
     It's alright...  this is our
     destiny.

He takes a deep breath.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Okay.  Okay, the thing is... I'm
     not exactly...  I mean-- only in
     the most literal sense-- I'm not
     Damon Bradley.

The fountain just dropped twenty feet.

               FAITH
          (staring straight
          ahead)
     What?

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I
     just told you it was Damon Bradley.

               FAITH
          (numbly)
     What is it?

               PETER
     It's Peter Wright.

He heaves a sigh of relief.  Draws her to him again.

               PETER
     Boy, am I glad that's over with.

She's frozen.  He's noticing this.  Until she extricates
herself from his arms.

               PETER
          (to himself)
     I had a feeling this was gonna be
     a problem.
          (to her)
     You're upset, right?

She shoots him a look.  Starts putting on her shoes.

               PETER
     Everything else is true.  I swear.
     I am a liberal.  I do live in
     Boston.  I am a zoologist.  I did
     see "Local Hero" fifteen times.
     I am single.  I don't believe in
     Scientology and I don't smoke.
     But, okay, I admit it, mea culpa,
     I lied about one little thing.

She runs out to the street.  Starts waving for a cab.

               FAITH
     One little thing?  You call your
     identity one little thing?

Following after her,

               PETER
     You've never lied?

Beat.

               FAITH
     That's not the point.

               PETER
     You said whatever it was you would
     understand.

               FAITH
     That was before I found out what
     it was.

A taxi approaches.

               PETER
     You're leaving?

No response.

               PETER
     Wait--  Let's put this in
     perspective.  You're going to let
     a few little letters keep us apart?

No response.  The cab stops.

               PETER
          (grasping at
          straws)
     Look, if the name's that much of
     a problem, why don't you just call
     me that?  It'll be my nickname.

She opens the taxi door.

               FAITH
          (on the brink of
          tears)
     How could you do this to me?

               PETER
          (innocently)
     I'm in love with you.

               FAITH
     Oh, come on...  What kind of an
     excuse is that?

And this time, the door SLAMS in his face.

EXT. PENSION LOBBY - NIGHT

The cab pulls up.  Faith gets out, drags into the hotel,
looking shell-shocked.  From the bar, Kate spots her and
rushes over.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PENSION BAR - MINUTES LATER

Kate and Faith are both at the bar, staring off into the
distance.  Getting bombed.

               KATE
     Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able
     to figure out what you want them
     to be and then they act like that.

               FAITH
          (tearfully)
     But how could he know?  He only
     just met me.

               KATE
     Men have ways.

Kate shakes her head.

               KATE
     What a drag.  You finally meet the
     man of your dreams and he turns
     out to be a pathological liar.

Faith wails.

INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He's on the telephone.

               PETER
     Still busy?  Okay, can I leave
     another message, please?
          (beat)
     Alright, the message is, would she
     rather have the wrong guy with the
     right name or the right guy with
     the wrong name?
          (beat)
     No-- no, no.  They alternate, see?
     It's the wrong guy--

INT. PENSION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE on the receiver, off the hook.  Faith is in bed, wide
awake, staring mournfully up at the ceiling.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PENSION ROOM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

Kate is on her way out the door.  She opens it-- to find Peter
outside in the hallway, carrying a bouquet of flowers the size
of a refrigerator.

               PETER
          (moving past her)
     I have to talk to her.

               KATE
     She's not here.

               PETER
     Where is she?

               KATE
     She went out to check into
     skywriting.  I can't believe you
     lied.  Is this a genetic thing,
     men will say anything just to get
     laid?

               PETER
     No!  That's not fair.  That's not
     it at all.  Look, something
     somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe
     some metaphysical wires got
     crossed.  I may not have the right
     name, but I was there.  I'm the
     guy.  I'm-- skywriting??

She eyes him skeptically.

               KATE
     You didn't think this would be a
     problem?

He starts pacing.

               PETER
     It was an emergency.  I only lied
     that night because it was the only
     way I knew to stop her.  I knew
     if I didn't, I'd never see her
     again.

               KATE
     Good strategy.

               PETER
     Do you know I wasn't even supposed
     to be in Rome?  My boss was
     supposed to come to this
     conference, and at the last minute
     he got the measles.  The measles.
     Who gets the measles at
     forty-three?  So they sent me.
     And I wasn't supposed to be in that
     piazza that night either.  I'd gone
     to the movies, only it was sold
     out.  So I was wandering around.
     Just wandering...  When I got hit
     in the head with this shoe.

He gazes out at the Roman skyline,

               PETER
     And then I saw her.  And all I know
     is, when I looked in her eyes I
     saw something... light.  And life
     and passion and yearning.  And
     something else I can't even put
     my finger on, something I'd never
     seen before--

               KATE
     Mania.

               PETER
     Whatever.  And I thought, please
     God, give me a sign, give me some
     way to keep this woman from getting
     into that taxi and disappearing
     from my life forever.  And He did.
     She told me the name.  Granted,
     it wasn't my name, but it was a
     start.

He turns to Kate.

               PETER
     And if that's not destiny, I don't
     know what is.

               KATE
          (touched)
     That's really romantic.

She places a consoling hand on his shoulder,

               KATE
     Too bad she hates your guts.

Starts leading him toward the door.

               PETER
     It's just a name for chrissakes.
     The whole thing is so ludicrous.
     For all she knows, this guy could
     be the biggest loser on the face
     of the planet.  He could have a
     criminal record.
          (throwing up his
          hands)
     He could think Ronald Reagan was
     a great president.

Kate shrugs.

               PETER
     I mean, realistically, what are
     the odds that this is a terrific
     guy?

               KATE
          (flatly)
     Ten billion to one.

Beat.

There's a KNOCK at the door.  She opens it.  It's Giovanni
-- with a single rose.

               GIOVANNI
     Guess who-oooo...

He sees Peter and the other flowers.

               GIOVANNI
     Oh.

               KATE
          (quickly)
     Giovanni, this is Faith's friend,
     Peter.

               GIOVANNI
     Oh, hello.
          (to Kate)
     I just came by to see if you wanted
     to join me for a drink, but--

               KATE
     I'd love to.

She heads for the door.

               PETER
          (pleading eyes)
     Please.  You've got to help me.

She considers him.

               KATE
     I'll see what I can do.

INT. COCKPIT OF A TEENY TINY PLANE - DAY

Faith is strapped into the passenger seat of a miniscule
two-seater.  White-knuckled.  Staring wide-eyed out the window
at a faint trail of vapor.

               FAITH
          (over the roar of
          the engine)
     Are you sure people are gonna be
     able to read this?...

The pilot nods.  The plane goes into a dive.  Faith's eyes
roll back in her head.

EXT. PENSION TERRACE - DAY

Kate and Giovanni are at a table, overlooking the domes of
the city, bathed in the honeyed late afternoon light.
Giovanni's pointing out the sights.  A plane buzzes overhead.
Kate looks up.  Some faint gibberish is being scattered to
the wind.  She shakes her head.  Giovanni takes her hand.

               KATE
          (a little
          nervously)
     Don't you have to be getting back
     to work?

His eyes sparkle.

               GIOVANNI
     It's siesta.

               KATE
     Oh.

               GIOVANNI
     You see, in America they care for
     work, they live to work.  But in
     Italy, they care for food, for
     love, for pleasure...

His lips graze her wrist.

               KATE
     How old are you?

               GIOVANNI
     What do the years matter?  I've
     known you for centuries...

INT. PENSION LOBBY - AFTERNOON

Faith enters.  Her hair looking like she stuck her finger in
a light socket.  She's handed an enormous stack of messages.
Peter, Peter, Peter, etc.  There are a lot of cross-outs.

She forces herself to drop them into the trash on her way up
the stairs.  Then opens her door and sees the flowers.  She
fingers one, momentarily softening, then turns resolute.  She
pulls her suitcase from beneath the bed and is unzipping it
when Kate enters, grinning from ear to ear.

               KATE
     Hi-iii...

               FAITH
     Hi.  Where've you been?

               KATE
     Sightseeing...
          (sobering as she
          realizes)
     What're you doing?

               FAITH
     Packing.

               KATE
     Why?

               FAITH
     Because I've been kidding myself.
     Because I realized you were right
     from the beginning.  This whole
     thing was just a wild goose chase.

               KATE
     So, you've had a little bad luck.

               FAITH
     A little bad luck?

               KATE
     Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that
     means the odds are probably in your
     favor now.  This is no time to give
     up.

Faith smiles wanly.  Starts pulling stuff out of drawers.

               FAITH
     Why do they read kids fairy tales
     in the first place?  Children are
     very impressionable, you know.

               KATE
     So you're just quitting?  Just like
     that?

Faith pauses.

               FAITH
     I thought you were the one who
     didn't think I should've come in
     the first place.

               KATE
     I know, but...

               FAITH
     It was a ouija board, remember?

               KATE
          (softly)
     ...and a fortune teller.

               FAITH
     Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't
     meant to be.  I've got forty-eight
     hours.  I can still make it home
     in time to marry Dwayne and try
     to forget any of this ever
     happened.

               KATE
     What about Peter?...

               FAITH
     Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An
     imposter.

               FAITH
     The last dead end in a long series
     of dead ends that I am relieved
     to finally be leaving behind.
          (glancing up)
     May as well start packing, our
     cab's gonna be here in an hour.

               KATE
     Who said I was going?

               FAITH
     What?

               KATE
     I'm just not ready to go home quite
     yet, that's all.

There's a tap at the door.  Giovanni pokes his head in.

               GIOVANNI
     You ready, Kate?  Oh, hi, Faith.
     Did you do something different to
     your hair?

Kate shakes her head.

               KATE
     He promised to take me on a tour
     of the fountains...
          (beat)
     But I don't have to go.

Faith looks at the two of them.  Realizing.

               FAITH
     No.  No, you go ahead.

               KATE
     You sure you'll be okay?

               FAITH
     I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for
     coming.  Thank you for being such
     a good friend.

               KATE
          (squeezing her
          hand)
     I'll be back before you leave.

She and Giovanni exit.  Faith picks up the telephone.

               FAITH
     Long distance operator, please.

INT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The phone rings.  The answering machine picks it up.

               PHONE MACHINE
     "Hi, it's Dwayne.  Don't be a heel,
     leave a message."

Beep.

               DAMON (O.S.)
     Hi, Dwayne.  It's me.  I'm just
     calling to say I'm on my way home.

INT. PENSION DIVINO AMORE - SUNSET

Faith's eyes drift to the window.

               FAITH
     The situation here is looking
     pretty hopeless.  I guess she's
     given up.
          (catching herself)
     So, it's Flight number 966.  It
     gets in at one tomorrow.  I'll see
     you then.

Click.

EXT. STREETS OF ROME - TWILIGHT

Faith is taking the same walk that was so magical the night
before.  But it's not the same.  She takes a few steps, tilts
her head back, and-- trips.  She's holding her foot in pain
when,

               O.S.
     Kate told me you were going home.
     Is that true?

She looks up, sees Peter.  Turns around and starts limping
briskly back towards her hotel.

               PETER
          (tagging after her)
     Is it?

No response.

               PETER
          (realizing)
     You're limping.

               FAITH
     I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my
     toe.

               PETER
     Are you okay?  You want some help?

               FAITH
     NO.

               PETER
     You are leaving, aren't you?

No response.

               PETER
     Why can't you just tell me?

               FAITH
     If it's any of your business, yes.

               PETER
     Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.

               FAITH
     Yes.

               PETER
     To the foot doctor.

               FAITH
     Yes.

He stops in front of her.  Looks her straight in the eye.

               PETER
     Why?

A long beat.

               FAITH
          (stepping around
          him)
     Because I know who Dwayne is, and
     he's reliable and stable and wants
     to marry me.

               PETER
          (dismissingly)
     He's safe.

               FAITH
     So?!  Is there something wrong with
     loving somebody who's safe?

               PETER
          (following her)
     Does he love you?

               FAITH
     He wants to marry me, doesn't he?

               PETER
     You didn't answer my question.

               FAITH
          (exasperated)
     Why are you asking me this?

               PETER
     Because I'd like to think at least
     one of you feels that way.  Does
     he  know who you are?

He touches her arm.  She pulls it away.

               PETER
          (utterly serious)
     You stubbed your toe, don't you
     think that's a sign?

               FAITH
     What?

               PETER
     He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your
     body's way of telling you something
     is wrong.  Your toe is trying to
     tell you not to do it.

She rolls her eyes, continues limping.

               PETER
     There must be something I can do,
     something I can say to make this
     up to you?...  Just tell me what
     it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it.
     I don't want you to hate me.

               FAITH
          (softening, she
          stops)
     Look, Peter, I don't hate you.
     But what we had was an illusion.
     Mutual wishful thinking.  We both
     wanted to believe it for awhile,
     but it was all founded on a lie.

               PETER
     So?

               FAITH
     So it wasn't real.

               PETER
     What about the oasis in the desert?
     Are you telling me that was a lie?

               FAITH
     No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...
          (almost more to
          herself)
     a mirage.

She looks at him.  Then, softly, sadly,

               FAITH
     Don't you see?..  We're not the
     ones who are meant to be.
          (earnestly)
     You're the man of somebody else's
     dreams.

               PETER
     Because I don't have the right
     name?!

She starts walking again.

               FAITH
     I'm going home.  I never should've
     come here in the first place and
     I'm going home.

He calls after her.

               PETER
     Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave
     me out of it.  But don't go
     throwing your life away on somebody
     you don't love.

               FAITH
          (she turns)
     Who says I don't love him?...

A long beat.

               PETER
     I see.  Well then, go home.  Get
     married.  I hope you'll be very
     happy.

And he walks quickly away, disappearing into the shadows.
She starts to call after him, but he's already gone.

EXT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Faith is waiting in the lobby as a CAB pulls up outside.  We
watch from a distance as she hugs Kate goodbye.  The DRIVER
comes in, picks up her bag, and she drags out the door behind
him.

INT. CAB - NIGHT

Faith is staring forlornly out the car window as the driver
gets in, turns over the engine.  They're pulling away when
SOMEONE runs out into the street, arms waving madly.

               PETER
          (running alongside
          the window)
     You can't go.

The cab is speeding up.

               FAITH
     Why not?

               PETER
     Because.  I know where he is.

It SCREECHES to a halt.

                                   CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Peter's helping her bring her things back inside.

               PETER
          (out of breath)
     I went back to that restaurant and
     I spoke with his waiter, just on
     an off chance, you know, and,
     anyway-- he knew the name of the
     guy's hotel.  So, I called there,
     they said he left yesterday.  But,
     apparently he comes here every
     year, always follows the same
     route.  He always goes from here
     down the coast to the Le Sirenuse
     hotel in Positano.  I called.  And
     they told me he's checked in.

               FAITH
     Where's Positano?

               PETER
     It's in the south.  I've still got
     my rental car.  I can get you there
     by morning...

               FAITH
     Oh no, I don't think that would
     be a good idea.

               PETER
     Look, I know there's no going back
     for us.  That's not it.  I just
     want to make this up to you.  Clear
     my relationship karma.  And I know
     the area, I've got some cousins
     down there.  Please.  Let me do
     this for you.  Let this be my gift
     to you.

She searches his eyes.

               FAITH
     Why?

               PETER
     Because-- I want you to be happy.

INT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The answering machine is recording Faith's message.

               DAMON (O.S.)
     Dwayne, you're still not there?...
     I was really hoping we could talk.
               (more)

               DAMON (Cont'd)
          (beat)
     I wanted to tell you she's made
     an unexpected recovery, but she's
     a little confused and she needs
     me to stay here one more day.  Just
     to be sure.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Kate's in the lobby.

               KATE
     Peter found him?

               FAITH
     Yes.  Isn't that amazing?

Kate looks over at him.  He shrugs.

               KATE
     Amazing...

               FAITH
     He's down in someplace called
     Positano.  Peter says we can make
     it there by morning.

As they head out the door, Peter turns quietly to Kate,

               PETER
          (relishing this)
     He's travelling with his mother...

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

They speed down darkened the highway, Faith and Peter in the
front seat, Kate and Giovanni in the back.  The wind in their
hair.

               PETER
     The guy at the hotel told me he
     always wears a gold medallion, and
     usually has a book or magazine with
     him.

               FAITH
          (to herself,
          encouraged)
     He likes to read...
          (to him)
     Did he mention anyone in
     particular?

Beat.

               PETER
     Uh, I'd rather not say.

               FAITH
     Tell me.

               PETER
     I'd really rather not say.

               FAITH
     Please.  I need to know.

               PETER
          (giving in)
     Mickey Spillane.

               FAITH
          (a little unnerved)
     Mickey Spillane?

               PETER
     Or Hustler.

The car shoots down the road.

EXT. AMALFI COAST - DAWN

They drive past sheer cliffs dropping off to silvery rocks,
azure seas, transparent depths.  Around hairpin turns skirting
the Gulf of Salerno, before finally winding into the
impossibly beautiful seaside town of Positano.  An enchanted
land of steep hillsides overgrown with lemon trees, jasmine,
bouganvilla...  cliff hanging villas... emerald and sapphire
grottoes...  cerulean skies...  heaven on earth.

EXT. LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - DAY

Another "Lifestyles" hotel.  An elegant old villa perched
above the village and the deep blue sea.  The four of them
head for the desk, where Kate cheerfully plunks down Larry's
credit card.

               KATE
     Joan Collins stayed here.

               FAITH
          (to concierge)
     Is Damon Bradley here?

               CONCIERGE
     Si.  A la piscina.

He gestures towards the terrace.

               PETER
     He's out by the pool right now.

               FAITH
          (nervously)
     Right now?

               PETER
     Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's
     here with his mother.

She checks her hair, starts adjusting it in the reflection
of a window.  Then peeks around the corner.

ANGLE ON a MAN reclining on a lounge chair.  We start at the
feet which don't quite reach the end of the chair.  Move up
the legs, past the pot belly, to, sure enough, an enormous
gold medallion resting on his chest.  A fringe of hair skirts
the perimeter of his head -- and his back.

A copy of Mickey Spillane's latest rests on a table next to
him.  He's lying back, eyes closed.  This is Damon Bradley.
This is Him...

Peter smiles broadly.  Faith's face falls.

               KATE
     That's him?!

Faith elbows her.

               KATE
     That's the guy you've been waiting
     for all these years?

               PETER
          (eating this up)
     Aren't you gonna go introduce
     yourself?

               FAITH
          (not particularly
          anxious to)
     Of course.

She doesn't move.

               PETER
     Do you want me to do it?

               FAITH
     NO.

She takes a good look.  Swallows hard.  Reluctantly
approaches.

               FAITH
     Hi...

He doesn't look up.  She stands awkwardly over him, looking
back at Kate for support.

               FAITH
     Uh-hem, excuse me, hello...

He cracks one eye, squints up at her.

               MAN AT POOL
     You're in my sun.

               FAITH
          (hopping out of
          the way)
     Oh.  Sorry.

He closes his eyes.

               FAITH
     Pardon me, but...

He squints up again.

               MAN AT POOL
     What?

Beat.

               FAITH
          (like an idiot)
     Do you have the time?

He eyeballs her like she's some sort of curious life form.

               MAN AT POOL
     Do I look like I'm wearing a watch?

He doesn't.

               FAITH
     No, I guess not.  I just thought
     maybe--

When someone at the edge of the pool calls out,

               O.S.
     Hey, Damon.

But the person she's talking to doesn't respond.  Instead,
somebody else, another MAN who'd been doing laps in the pool,
emerges.

               HIM
     Yeah?

This is no ordinary mortal, this is a living monument to
mankind.  He could've modeled for Michelangelo.  Mel Gibson
feels like Jo-Jo-the-Dog-Faced-Boy next to this guy.  The guys
in the Calvin Klein ads-- okay, let's say he looks like one
of those guys.

Kate's eyes shift to Peter, who suddenly sobers.

Back at the pool, a LITTLE KID is talking to Damon.

               LITTLE KID
     Thanks for letting me borrow this.

The kid sets the Spillane tome back on his chair.

               HIM
     No problem.

He gets out and starts toweling off, a halo of sunlight
glistening off his tanned, muscular body; reflecting in the
deep green pools of his eyes.  She grabs hold of a nearby
chair as her knees start to give way.

               FAITH
          (barely audible)
     You're Damon Bradley?

               HIM
     Uh huh.

Oh. My. Goddd.

It's now or never.  She takes a deep breath.  Lets it out.

               FAITH
     Excuse me.

It's never.  She goes running back inside.

               KATE
          (whispering loudly)
     Whatareyoudoing?!

               FAITH
          (spinelessly)
     What if he doesn't like me?

               KATE
     It means you're a completely
     worthless excuse for a human being,
     and the fates have all conspired
     to make you miserable.

               FAITH
     My God... you're right.

               KATE
     Faith, I'm kidding.
          (stopping her)
     Is this how you plan to get what
     you want from life?  When you
     finally find it, you turn and run
     away from it?

She gazes fearfully back out to the terrace.

               PETER
     Hey, if she doesn't wanna meet him,
     she doesn't wanna meet him.

Kate glares at him.  Takes Faith by the shoulders.

               KATE
     You have overcome everything it
     took to get here.  Every obstacle
     to reach this moment.  This fateful
     moment.  Now, it's in your hands.

She points toward the terrace.

               KATE
     Is that what you want?

Is this a trick question?

               KATE
     Then go get it.

EXT. POOL - MOMENTS LATER

He's picking up his things.

               O.S.
     Hi again...

He looks up.

               HIM
          (perfectly
          friendly)
     Hello.

               FAITH
          (nervously
          fingering her
          necklace)
     Beautiful place...

               HIM
     Sure is.

A pause.

               FAITH
     Been here long?

               HIM
     Just since yesterday.

               FAITH
     I just got here, too.  Not
     yesterday.  But, just now.  Today.
     Just a few minutes ago.
          (looking around)
     Yeah, we just got here...  I mean,
     I just got here.  I'm single.

He looks at her.  Uh huh.

               FAITH
          (chickening out)
     Well, I'll probably be seeing you
     around, then.

She starts to skulk away.

               HIM
          (politely)
     I hope so.

She pauses, turns,

               FAITH
     I was wondering...
          (not looking at
          him)
     Do you have dinner plans?

               HIM
     Tonight?

               FAITH
          (her eyes
          tentatively meet
          his)
     Any night.

               HIM
     Well, not exactly...

               FAITH
     Would you be willing to have dinner
     with me?

A slow smile creeps across his lips.  Why not?

               HIM
     Sure.

               FAITH
          (somehow
          maintaining)
     You would?  Really?

He nods.

               FAITH
     Okay.  Okay, how about I meet you
     at the restaurant at the base of
     the stairs at, say, 8:30?

A smile that would melt Nome in January,

               HIM
     I'll look forward to it.

               FAITH
          (backing away)
     Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.

She's about to trip over a chaise lounge.

               HIM
     Wait.

               FAITH
     Yes?

               HIM
     Aren't you going to tell me who
     you are?

               FAITH
          (stepping forward)
     Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.

               HIM
          (extending a hand)
     It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.

He takes her hand.  Kisses it.  Peter rolls his eyes.

She turns around and dashes back inside.  We hear an
ear-splitting SHRIEK of excitement come from inside the hotel.
Damon smiles to himself.

EXT. POSITANO - DAY

The jet-setters have Sardinia, this is a resort with bohemian
roots and small town charm.  A barber sets his chair in the
street outside his shop.  A workman is polishing the bronze
mermaid out in front of "Siren Travel".

"Two Gentlemen from Verona" is being performed at the
community theatre.  Housewives open shutters, shopkeepers
sweep storefronts of fruit stands, pottery and linen shops.
Men carry armloads of flowers, boxes of lemons and gleaming
fish to market.  Children play at the edge of the sea.
Mayberry in Italy.

Kate and Giovanni are down at the beach, frolicking in the
water.

And Faith is strolling through town, floating on air.  She
spots a dress in a clothing store window.

INT. CLOTHING SHOP - DAY

Faith emerges from a dressing room in something summery and
flowing.  She looks beautiful.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SUNSET

A jar of green goo.  Faith's plastering one of those green
clay masks to her face.  Her dress is hanging on the door.
She's got rollers in her hair.  She and Kate are getting ready
for dinner.

               FAITH
     Did you see his eyes?  I've never
     seen eyes that green.  And he was
     so nice.  Did you see how nice he
     was?  He was really nice.

There's a KNOCK at the door.  She freezes.

               KATE
     I thought you were meeting him
     there?

Panicking, Faith dashes to the bathroom, starts frantically
rinsing off the mask.

               FAITH
     That's what I thought.

Kate opens the door.  It's Peter.

               KATE
     Oh, it's you.
          (to Faith)
     It's only Peter.

               PETER
     Thanks.

               KATE
     Sorry...

Relieved, Faith steps out from behind the bathroom door, still
wiping green stuff off her face.

               FAITH
     Hi, Peter.

               PETER
     Hi.

An awkward beat.

               FAITH
     Come on in.

He does.

               PETER
     So.  You found him.

               FAITH
     You found him.  I don't know how
     to thank you.

He shrugs.

               PETER
     Well, it looks like we both lucked
     out.  I just met somebody myself.
     Somebody my aunt introduced me to.

               FAITH
          (a little
          surprised)
     Oh.  That's nice.

               PETER
     Yeah.

Beat.

               PETER
     And she's a knock-out, too.

               FAITH
     Well, good.  Good for you.

               PETER
     Anyway, that's why I came by.  I
     need to fix this button.  Do you
     have a needle and thread?

This is pretty transparent, but she politely plays along.
As she starts looking through her stuff, he starts idly
fingering their toiletries.  Smells her perfume, etc.

               PETER
     So, you're going to dinner?

She nods.

               PETER
     Where are you going?  Just-- out
     of curiosity...

               FAITH
     Just to that place down at the
     bottom of the stairs.  Nothing
     fancy.

She hands him the needle and thread.

               PETER
     Oh, thanks.
          (really trying)
     Well, have a good time.

               FAITH
          (heartfelt)
     You too.

As he exits,

               PETER
     Hey--

               FAITH
     What?

               PETER
     Nice dress.

               FAITH
          (gracious and
          indebted)
     Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so
     much.

He nods and leaves.  She looks at Kate.

Faith emerges from her room and starts down the steep hillside
stairs that lead to the village.  Lights along the shore are
beginning to glitter; a warm breeze flows in like silk.  It's
the sort of moment and sort of place where all dreams seem
within reach.

Down below she can see him waiting for her outside the
restaurant door.  She pauses a moment to take it all in.  He
looks up and sees her.  Blows a kiss up to her.  She
practically swoons.

As she arrives at the foot of the stairs, he takes her hand,

               HIM
     You look like a goddess.

INT. BUCA DI BACCO RESTAURANT - TWILIGHT

A open-air place, overlooking the sea.  Waves crash.
Moonlight glistens on the water.  Guitarists stroll by,
singing sentimental Neopolitan ballads.  It's all almost too
good to be true.  They're led to a table and he pulls out her
chair.  The perfect gentleman.  A WAITER comes over to welcome
them.  Asks if they'd like a drink.

               HIM
          (to Faith)
     Wine?

She's a little giddy.

               FAITH
     Sure.

               HIM
          (to the waiter)
     Brunello di Montalcino, '85,
     please.

Back to her.

               HIM
          (leaning forward)
     You know, I noticed you out at the
     pool even before we spoke.  I could
     sense the chemistry between us.

               FAITH
          (a little
          flustered)
     Really?

               HIM
          (bedroom eyes)
     Really...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

The WAITER arrives with the wine.  Pours.  She raises a glass.

               FAITH
     Well, to-- new friends.

               HIM
     And more...

They toast.

               FAITH
     So, I guess you're probably
     wondering why I asked you to
     dinner...

He sets down his glass.

               HIM
     Not really.  Happens to me all the
     time.

An awkward laugh.  It probably does.  Damon picks up his menu,
scans the prices.

               HIM
     Well, fuck me.

She must be hearing things.

               FAITH
     Excuse me?

               HIM
     Nothing.
          (clearing his
          throat)
     Prices are a little steep here,
     aren't they?

               FAITH
     Don't worry about it.  You're my
     guest.

She picks up her menu.

               FAITH
     What looks good?

               HIM
          (perusing it)
     Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds
     good...

               FAITH
     You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.

Small world.

They're still pondering their options when another COUPLE
stroll in and are led to the table directly next to theirs.
It's Peter and his date, FRANCESCA.  And this time he was
telling the truth.  She's stunning.  All suntanned legs and
skintight spandex.  Beaming, he pulls out her chair.  Faith
just stares at him.  As he moves around the table to sit down,
his eye catches hers.

               PETER
          (sotto)
     What?...

               FAITH
          (hissing)
     What are you doing here?

               PETER
     We were hungry.

She turns her back on him.

               HIM
          (looking up from
          his menu)
     So what do you think?

               FAITH
          (distracted)
     Uh, the scampi sounds good to me,
     too.

               O.S.
     Damon.  There you are.

An ELEPHANT OF A WOMAN approaches, Damon waves her over.

               HIM
          (to Faith)
     I didn't think you'd mind...

She proceeds to plant herself at their table.

               HIM
     Faith, this is my mother.

               FAITH
     Oh, hello.

               HIM
     Mommy, this is Faith.

Trying to conceal her surprise, Faith politely extends a hand.

               FAITH
     Nice to meet you, Mrs. Bradley.

Peter drops his napkin, leans over towards Faith to retrieve
it,

               PETER
          (whispering into
          her ear)
     "Mommy"?

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER.  Their food has arrived.  Francesca is rubbing Peter's
leg under the table.  Faith is trying to ignore this.

               FAITH
     So, you say you've been to Italy
     before?

               HIM
     A few times.  It's kind of an
     annual tradi--

               PETER
          (to Damon)
     Pardon me, but could we borrow your
     salt?

Faith glares at him.

               HIM
     Sure.

He hands it over.

               FAITH
     You were saying...

               PETER
          (to Damon)
     Boy, that looks tasty.  What is
     that?

               HIM
          (chewing)
     Scampi.

               DAMON'S MOTHER
     Damon.  Not with your mouth full.

               PETER
     Scampi, huh?  I love scampi.  I
     practically always get it in these
     seafood places.  Is that good
     scampi?

Damon nods.  Swallows.

               HIM
     You want to try some?

               PETER
          (pleased with
          himself)
     Sure.  I'll trade you some of my
     pasta.

They start cheerily exchanging portions.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER STILL.  The candles have burnt low.  The plates are
being cleared.  Francesca and Peter are feeding each other
dessert.  Giggling.  Damon snaps his fingers at a waiter.

               HIM
     El checko, por favor.

Annoyed, the WAITER totals up their tab and starts to hand
it to him.  Damon motions towards Faith.  She takes it, starts
pulling out lire as he and his mother get up.

               PETER
     Say, I saw where they had motor
     boats for rent down in the harbor.
     Why don't we all go for an evening
     cruise around the bay?

               FAITH
     I don't know if that's such a--

               DAMON AND HIS MOTHER
          (in unison)
     Great idea!

Faith is still counting as Damon and his mother, Peter and
Francesca all head for the door.  She finally finishes,
hurries to her feet to catch up with Peter,

               FAITH
          (at his side)
     Why are you doing this?

               PETER
     I just wanted to keep an eye on
     you.  The guy's a total stranger,
     remember?

               FAITH
     So were you.

               PETER
     Exactly.
          (beat)
     Besides, no hard feelings.  You
     found somebody.  I found somebody.
     I thought we could double.

EXT. HOTEL ROOM TERRACE - EVENING

Kate and Giovanni are dining outside on the vine-covered
terrace.

               GIOVANNI
     This is back when I was in school,
     you take those tests, you know?
     They said I should go into physical
     therapy.
          (he takes a bite)
     Or wood-working.

She looks confused.

               GIOVANNI
          (simply)
     I'm good with my hands.

The phone RINGS.

               KATE
     Hold that thought.

Kate goes inside to pick it up.

               KATE
     Hello?

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Faith at a pay phone outside the restaurant.

               FAITH
     Kate.  Thank God you're there.
     I need help.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               KATE
     Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there.
     How is he, anyway?

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Faith glances over at Damon -- as he pinches a woman walking
by.

               FAITH
     It's still a little too early to
     say...

EXT. A BOAT IN THE TYRRHENIAN SEA - NIGHT

Kate and Giovanni are here.  Damon's mother is in the corner.
Snoring.  Damon is pontificating on global policy to Peter.

               HIM
     Irregardless of the politics.  It's
     time we stopped dicking around.
     I'm telling you, nuculear is the
     only way out.

               PETER
     But don't you think that's a little
     short-sighted?

               KATE
          (sotto, to Faith)
     Not only is he a momma's boy and
     a fascist, he says "nuculear" and
     "irregardless".

               FAITH
     No one's perfect, Kate.

               KATE
     And he is living proof.

               FAITH
     No, I think maybe you've been
     right.  I think I may have been
     too critical in the past.

Damon BELCHES loudly.

               KATE
     Faith, if I may say so, you picked
     a helluva time to come to this
     realization.

               HIM (O.S.)
     Human rights, shmuman rights.

               FAITH
          (hope springs
          eternal)
     Maybe I can change him.

               KATE
     I thought this was supposed to be
     the one guy in the world you
     wouldn't need to change.

They stare over at him.

               FAITH
     Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.

               KATE
     Or maybe it'll turn him back into
     a toad.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

LATER.  Francesca is idly running her fingers through Peter's
hair.

               FAITH
     Well, what about books?  You like
     Hemingway?  You gotta love
     Hemingway.

               PETER
     The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the
     Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--

               HIM
     He's alright.  For a closet homo.

Faith's jaw muscles tighten slightly as she tries to take this
in stride.

               FAITH
     How about music?  You like
     classical?

               PETER
     The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.

Damon yawns.

               FAITH
     Well, how about those old romantic
     movies with those great stars, huh?
     Like Audrey Hepburn.

               PETER
     Actually, I think I prefer
     Katherine Hepburn.

               HIM
     Audrey was cool.

Finally.  She smiles.  Damon SPITS noisily over the side.

               HIM
     Too bad she didn't have any tits.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

Kate is listing things.  Faith and Damon are nodding their
heads, yes and no.  Never in unison.

               KATE
     Baseball.  Carmelcorn.  Organized
     religion.  Sting.  Grape-flavored
     candy.  The Marx Brothers.  Long
     foreplay.  Gardening.  Drum solos.
     Dogs.  Mai tais.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

Kate, checking her list.

               KATE
     Amazing.  With the exception of
     fruitcake, which, let's be honest,
     everybody hates,
          (looks up)
     you two have absolutely nothing
     whatsoever in common.
          (re-checking her
          list)
     That's got to be almost
     statistically impossible.

Francesca and Peter are up towards the bow of the boat,
cavorting, hanging on each other.  Faith is facing them, with
her back to Damon.

               FAITH
          (not wanting to
          look)
     What's he doing now?

Kate peers over her shoulder.

               KATE
     He's tearing the wings off a moth
     and making it walk around.

Faith buries her head in her hands.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

Faith is standing at the railing alone, gazing out at the open
ocean.  When she feels someone sidling up next to her.

               HIM
     So, what are we waiting for?

               FAITH
     What?

               HIM
     Let's face it.  You want me.

He places a hand on her breast.  She lets out a blood-curdling
SCREAM.  Peter comes running to her rescue.  Hauls off and
decks him.

EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

Peter and Giovanni are forcibly dragging Damon off the boat,
down the dock.  Still onboard, she and Kate watch them go,
in a daze.

               FAITH
          (numbly)
     He's a jerk.

               KATE
     Yes.  He is.

               FAITH
     I spent my whole life waiting for
     a creep.

               KATE
     Yup.

               FAITH
     I came all the way to Italy in
     search of a weasel.

               KATE
          (still watching
          them go)
     When you could've found one in
     America.

Francesca steps past them off the boat.

               FRANCESCA
     Do not feel bad.  He was scum.

EXT. LANDING - NIGHT

After the men are out of earshot, we see Peter pull this guy
aside.  And surreptitiously hand him an envelope.

               HIM
     You didn't think that last bit with
     the bugs was a little over the top?

               PETER
     Not at all.  You were perfect.

Handing him another envelope.

               PETER
     And thank Mrs. Walker, too.

EXT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

Faith and Kate are still there, unloading a groggy Mrs.
Bradley.   She goes tottering down the dock, as Peter returns.

               PETER
     You okay?

               FAITH
     Yeah.

               PETER
          (sympathetically)
     I guess he turned out to be kind
     of a loser, huh?

She sighs, nods.

               PETER
     I'm sorry.

               FAITH
     I feel like the world's biggest
     idiot.

He finishes securing the boat.

               PETER
     Why should you be embarrassed?
     He was the jerk.

She doesn't believe this, but appreciates the gesture.

               FAITH
     In spite of the way it all turned
     out, though, I want you to know
     how much I appreciate your helping
     me find him.  I would always have
     wondered what might have been.

He pauses.

               PETER
     Yeah.
          (then)
     Well, was the least I could do.

               FAITH
     No, it was more than that.  It was
     very generous of you.  It was very
     kind.

His eyes meet hers.  From the landing, Francesca calls after
him impatiently.

               PETER
          (reluctantly)
     I better go.

Faith's eyes shift between the two of them.

               FAITH
     Sure.  I understand.

He touches her shoulder.

               PETER
     Promise me you won't leave without
     saying goodbye.

               FAITH
     No.  Course not.

And with that, he gets up, steps off the boat and heads down
the pier with Francesca clinging to him.  She watches them
walk away.

               KATE
     So...

               FAITH
     So.  I guess I've got a wedding
     to go to.

Faith steps off the boat and walks down the pier, a solitary
figure, who finally disappears in the mist.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Faith is packing.  She picks up her "Let's Go Italy" guide,
and the polaroid of her and Peter falls out.  "The Kiss".
She sighs.  Tucks it back inside the book.  She picks up her
wallet, opens the coin purse, reaches in to pull out her
ENGAGEMENT RING.  As she does, something else falls to the
floor.  Dwayne's DRY CLEANING TICKET.  She stares down at it.
Then takes the ring, places it back in her wallet.  And picks
up the telephone.

INT. HER MOTHER'S HOME - DAY

Her mother is sobbing hysterically.  Larry is there.  Dwayne
is there.  Leslie is there.  Leslie's eyes meet Dwayne's
meaningfully.

EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

Kate and Giovanni are walking down the pier, hand in hand.
He stops her, leans her up against the railing, and plants
a massive kiss on her.  After she's managed to catch her
breath,

               KATE
     Giovanni, I want to thank you.

               GIOVANNI
     I thank you.

He goes to kiss her again.

               KATE
     No, you don't understand.  It's
     been wonderful meeting you.  But...
     I have a husband.  I have two kids
     at camp.  I have a life I have to
     go back to.

               GIOVANNI
     You don't have to go if you don't
     want to...

               KATE
     But I do want to.

He realizes where this isn't going.  Tries another tack.

               GIOVANNI
          (hurt)
     You think I'm just one of those
     Italian Casanovas.  The guys who
     try to seduce every woman who comes
     their way.  Who prey on unhappily
     married women.  Who lure
     unsuspecting--

               KATE
     Giovanni.

               GIOVANNI
     Huh?

               KATE
     That's exactly what you are.

Beat.

               GIOVANNI
     Is it that obvious?

She smiles.

               KATE
     Thank you for making me feel
     wanted.

She turns, and heads up the stairs.  Alone.  After a beat,

               GIOVANNI
     Kate.

She looks back down,

               GIOVANNI
     It was my pleasure.

And he starts down the street.  Passes an outdoor cafe.  With
an attractive woman in it.  ANGLE ON the WOMAN.

               O.S.
     Do you believe in love at first
     sight?...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Faith is in bed.  In the darkness.  The door opens.

               FAITH
     Kate is that you?

               KATE
     Uh huh.

               FAITH
     I didn't expect you back so soon.

Kate closes the door.

               KATE
     Well, I realized, if you're getting
     married, you're gonna be needing
     the maid of honor, right?

               FAITH
     Actually, no.  There's not going
     to be a wedding.

               KATE
     Oh.

Beat.

               KATE
     Well... I ought to be getting home
     anyway.  The kids'll be back from
     camp soon.  The house is probably
     a mess.

               FAITH
     And Larry?...

               KATE
     What about Larry?

               FAITH
     I don't know.  I've just been
     thinking... maybe this destiny
     thing is more of a do-it-yourself
     operation.  Maybe the things that
     are meant to be are the things we
     want badly enough to fight for.

The room is quiet.  You can hear the waves in the distance.

               KATE
     Maybe...

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

It's a glorious morning.  Birds chirp.  The sea shimmers in
the distance.  Faith is standing outside a hotel room door.
She takes a deep breath.  Knocks.  It opens.  Peter.

               PETER
     Hi.

               FAITH
     Hi.  Are you... busy?

               PETER
     No.
          (beat)
     Are you're leaving?

               FAITH
     No.  I just came by to apologize.

He looks at her questioningly.

               FAITH
     It seems like ever since I found
     out about this guy, this name, I've
     been kind of crazy.  Like I was
     on drugs or something.

               PETER
     I know the feeling.

               FAITH
     Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also
     wanted to tell you, I'm not getting
     married.

               PETER
     You aren't?

               FAITH
     No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I
     decided to call it off.  Well,
     actually, it was kind of mutual.

               PETER
     Well.  Congratulations.

               FAITH
     Thank you.
          (beat)
     So, since I have a few more days
     of vacation left, I was wondering
     if maybe you'd want to do something
     sometime.  I mean, you know, if
     you don't have... other plans.

               PETER
     Are you asking me out?

Beat.

               FAITH
     Yes.  I am.

               PETER
          (gently)
     In that case... no...

She looks down at the ground.  Nods.

               PETER
     I don't have other plans.

She looks back up.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Kate goes to the desk for her key.  The concierge hands it
to her, along with something else.  An envelope.

               KATE
     What's this?

               CONCIERGE
     From an admirer...

She hesitantly opens it.  Inside is a college catalogue.  A
note:  "Please turn to page 51".  Puzzled, she opens it to
page 51.  The Sociology section.  A class is circled:
"Trans-gender Modes of Communication in Post-Modern Society".
And another note in the margin: "You want to take it with me?"
LARRY steps into view from around a corner.  She looks up.
Tears in her eyes.

EXT. THE STEPS - DAY

Peter and Faith are overlooking the sea, towards Capri.

               PETER
     You can't come to Southern Italy
     and not see the Blue Grotto.

               FAITH
     I just need to run up and get my
     bathing suit.

               PETER
     Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock
     in ten minutes.

As she dashes off,

               PETER
     Hurry...

EXT. POSITANO VILLAGE - DAY

Faith is on her way back to her room.  She passes the
community playhouse where two teenage kids are up on ladders,
suspending a banner across the stairs announcing a new play:
"The Odyssey".   One kid accidentally drops his end, and it
goes fluttering down across her path.  Faith stops to retrieve
it and is handing it back up to him when she glances at the
window where the eight-by-tens of the play's stars are being
changed.  The new star of the show is noneother than Damon
Bradley.  Only his name isn't Damon Bradley.  It's LEONARD
GILINSKY.  She stares at the photo.  And suddenly has trouble
breathing.

EXT. DOCK - DAY

Peter is waiting at the dock.  Checks his watch.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Faith is packing.  Furiously hurling stuff into a suitcase.
Peter shows up at the door.

               PETER
     Is something the matter?

               FAITH
     GET OUT!!

Backing behind it,

               PETER
          (sotto)
     I'd call that a yes.
          (peeking around
          the corner)
     Do I get a hint?

               FAITH
     You want a hint?  I'll give you
     a hint.  You are the lowest, most
     despicable, most reprehensible form
     of reptilian swine--

               PETER
     There's no such thing.

               FAITH
     What?

               PETER
     Reptilian swine.  There's no such
     thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.

               FAITH
     Who cares?!  You hired an actor??

               PETER
     I don't know what you're talking
     about.
          (a nervous beat)
     Who told you that?

               FAITH
     No one had to tell me.  He's
     starring in the local play.

A bead of sweat rolls down his neck.

               FAITH
     You did, didn't you?  You got
     somebody to pretend to be him?
     Tell me the truth.  For once.

He takes a deep breath.

               PETER
     Alright.  The truth is... I thought
     we had something here.

               FAITH
     I can't believe you did that!

               PETER
     And I can't believe you are so
     stubborn and so blind as to let
     some stranger, some phantom you've
     never even met destroy it.

               FAITH
          (turning on him)
     You're the reason I never met him.
     You knew it was the thing I most
     wanted in life and you sabotaged
     it.

               PETER
     I sabotaged it?  You're the one
     who lost him, remember?

               FAITH
     Well, I might've found him again
     if I hadn't left Rome to make this
     pointless trip down here with you.

               PETER
     As I recall, you were on your way
     home.  And I didn't want you to
     go so, yes, I told you a little
     white lie.

               FAITH
     A "little white lie"?  A "little
     white lie"?

               PETER
     What would you call it?

               FAITH
     I would call it-- unforgivable.

Silence.

               PETER
     Don't you think you're overreacting
     just a little here?   We're talking
     about love, okay?  Let's be
     rational.

               FAITH
     Rational?!  Love is not rational!
     Are you crazy?

               PETER
          (throwing up his
          hands)
     Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven
     me crazy.  No one in their right
     mind would go to this much trouble
     to win over someone as insane as
     you.  Did it ever, even for one
     second, occur to you how much work
     it was to set all this up?  How
     many arrangements had to be made?
     How many players had to be
     coordinated?

               FAITH
     Gee, I'm flattered.  What an
     incredibly romantic gesture.
     Cancel the roses, I've decided to
     lie to her instead.

               PETER
     Very funny.

               FAITH
     No, it isn't.  I called off my
     wedding all because of you.

A beat.

               PETER
          (touched)
     Really?...

               FAITH
          (realizing this
          herself for the
          first time)
     Yes.

Then,

               PETER
     And this is the thanks I get.  I
     did you a favor.  You never wanted
     to marry that joker in the first
     place.

               FAITH
     That's not the point.
          (realizing she's
          just given herself
          away)
     And what if I had wanted to?

               PETER
     If you had wanted to, you'd have
     gone home.

Then, more calmly,

               PETER
     Look, I just thought if you finally
     got rid of this obsession with this
     name, if you could get it out of
     your system once and for all, then
     maybe you'd be able to stop waiting
     and open your heart to someone
     real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I
     didn't do it to hurt you.  I did
     it for you.
          (beat)
     I did it for us...

               FAITH
     There is no us.

His eyes harden.

               PETER
     Oh, that's right.  There's only
     him.  Mr. Perfect Imaginary Man.
     You know, I gave you more credit
     than you deserved.  The truth is,
     you're in love with the fantasy.
     You're afraid of something real.

And he storms out the door.

EXT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

CLOSE ON a pile of cornball souvenirs.  A little gondola.
A little colosseum.  The little liqueur bottles.

Kate and Larry are at a table.  She's been collecting things
for him all along the way.

               LARRY
     Are you kidding?  All that stuff
     was for you, Kate.  It just seemed
     like you were mad at me, so I
     thought maybe if I-- I hate Polo...

Kate smiles.  In love with him all over again.

               LARRY
     There's just one thing I still
     don't understand.

She looks at him.

               LARRY
     I don't have a great aunt in Italy.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Peter, carrying his suitcase, turns in his key to the
concierge. Signs his bill.  And resignedly exits out the door.

ANGLE on the mermaid out in front of "SIREN TRAVEL".  Inside,
Faith is waiting in line.  She steps up to the window.  On
the other side of the counter is Damon.  That is, is Leonard.

               FAITH
     You...

               LEONARD
          (a little uneasy)
     Hi there...

               FAITH
     Before you start picking your nose,
     I know he put you up to it.

He looks disappointed.

               LEONARD
     It was the moth stuff that gave
     it away, didn't it?
          (to himself)
     I knew that was too much.

               FAITH
     No, you gave a very convincing
     performance.  And you'll be pleased
     to know that your eight-by-ten
     glossy is now on display at the
     local playhouse.

               LEONARD
     My picture's up?

He conveys this to a co-worker in Italian.  They exchange
high-fives.

               FAITH
          (glumly)
     Congratulations.

               LEONARD
     Thanks.

               FAITH
     So, this is what you do?  I mean
     when you're not playing other
     parts?

               LEONARD
     I take it things didn't work out
     between the two of you?

She shakes her head.

               LEONARD
     That's a shame.

She shrugs.  Heh.

               FAITH
     Yeah, well... Anyway, I'm here to
     pick up my ticket.  TWA, Flight
     877.

He starts punching it into his computer.

               LEONARD
     Is this your first trip here?

She nods.

               LEONARD
     It's an amazing place, don't you
     think?

               FAITH
     Amazing.

               LEONARD
     Smoking or non-smoking?

               FAITH
     Non.
          (beat)
     Please.

He nods.

               LEONARD
     Lots of history.  For example, did
     you know, according to legend, this
     coastline used to harbor Sirens?

               FAITH
     Hm.

               LEONARD
     Beautiful women who could lure men
     to their destruction with their
     singing.  Nobody's ever really seen
     them and lived to tell about it.
     But, I don't know.  An awful lot
     of ships wrecked on those rocks.

He shrugs.  Hands her her ticket.

               LEONARD
     Well.  Have a good trip.

She nods.  Distant.  And we stay on her face.

INT. CAR - DAY

Peter places his suitcase in the car.  Gets in.  Tosses
something out the window.  A dead gardenia.

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

Kate and Larry.  Larry starts choking on his Campari.

               LARRY
     Damon Bradley?  That's why you're
     here?

               KATE
     What?  You know him?

               LARRY
          (chuckling
          nervously)
     It was just a joke.  I was pushing
     the arrow.  I wanted to get to the
     next question.  I wanted to find
     out who was gonna win the Series.

               KATE
     Are you saying you just made the
     whole thing up?  The guy never even
     existed?

               LARRY
     He existed.  He was some kid I knew
     from Little League.
          (musing)
     He was a real jerk.
          (he looks up at
          her)
     You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?

               KATE
          (nodding)
     Went to high school with him.
     But...

               KATE
     what about the fortune teller?

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CARNIVAL NIGHT - NIGHT

Twenty years ago.  A young Faith is sitting across from the
fortune teller.  There's a pounding at the back door.

This time we stay with Madame Divina, following her as she
gets up, marches to the back of the booth and throws open the
door.  Standing there is Larry.  He whispers something in her
ear as he hands her a five dollar bill.

               LARRY (V.O.)
     I thought she'd get a kick out of
     it.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               LARRY
     It was a harmless little prank.
     Who in the world would've thought
     she'd spend her life waiting for
     this guy?

               KATE
     Larry, you've got to tell her.

               LARRY
     I can't tell her.  She's called
     off her wedding.  She'll never
     speak to me again.

He looks up pleadingly.

               LARRY
     You tell her.

Faith bounding up the steps.  She races to Peter's room.
Pounds on the door.  No answer.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Faith dashes to the desk, runs into Kate and Larry.

               FAITH
     Larry!  What are you doing here?
          (realizing)
     Mom sent you.

               LARRY
     No.

He puts an arm around Kate.

               LARRY
     I came after the woman I love.

               KATE
     He missed me.

Faith smiles.  He puts his other arm around her.

               LARRY
     The two women I love.  How are you,
     Faith?

She's a little surprised by this outpouring of affection.

               FAITH
     I'm fine.
          (to Kate)
     Have you seen Peter?

               KATE
     He's gone.  He told me what
     happened.  He just left for the
     airport.

               FAITH
     Larry, did you rent a car?

               LARRY
     Yeah--

               KATE
     Faith.  Larry has something he
     wants to tell you about Damon
     Bradley.

Larry is violently shaking his head "no".  Kate jabs him.

               KATE
     I'll leave you two alone.

She exits the room.  Stranding him.

               FAITH
     Larry, can I borrow your car keys?

               LARRY
     Faith, this guy you think is Mr.
     Right, he's... not what you think--

               FAITH
     Don't worry, it's a long story,
     but I know who he is.  I know where
     to find him.

               LARRY
     But, Faith--

               FAITH
     Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.

She spots the keys lying on the table.  Grabs them, bolts for
the door.

               FAITH
     I'll bring it back as soon as I
     can.

               LARRY
          (calling after her)
     But Faith--

               FAITH
     What?...

Beat.

               LARRY
          (chickening out)
     It's the red Fiat.

INT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Kate and Faith's room.

               KATE
     She what?!

               LARRY
     She said she knew where to find
     him, and then she grabbed my car
     keys, and--

               KATE
     And you didn't tell her?

               LARRY
     She didn't give me a chance.

Kate pins him with her eyes.

               LARRY
     Well, you never know...
          (lamely)
     Maybe they'll hit it off...

EXT. DRIVEWAY OF THE LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Kate is yanking Larry into a taxi.

               LARRY
     What do you mean we have to stop
     her before she does something
     crazy?

EXT. AMALFI DRIVE - DAY

Faith goes screeching around a curve.  A few beats later, the
TAXI follows.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY

Faith speeds through the tangled web of Roman traffic.  Kate
and Larry in close pursuit.

EXT. ROME AIRPORT - DAY

Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone.
Dashes inside.  Scans the DEPARTURE SCREEN for a flight to
BOSTON.  Finds it: AMERICAN AIRLINES, GATE NUMBER 7, "ON
TIME", at 5:00.  She checks her watch.  It's 4:57.  She starts
racing down the corridor.

INT. JET - DAY

Aboard the plane, Peter is settling into his seat.

INT. AIRPORT CORRIDOR - DAY

A vending machine.  SOMEBODY at it with his back to us pushes
the Butterfinger button.  The "SOLD OUT" light blinks on.
A FIST starts banging on machine.  Faith sprints by.
Oblivious.

INT. GATE 7 - DAY

Faith rushes to GATE #7.  Slaps something down on the desk
in front of the CLERK.

               FAITH
     Boarding pass.

Blows past him.  He sticks out an arm.

               CLERK
     I'm afraid you're too late, m'am.

She stops.  Breathing hard.  Uncomprehending.  He looks at
the pass.

               CLERK
     And this isn't for this airline,
     either.

Faith turns to the window to see the portable stairs once
again being pulled away from the cabin door.  Deja vu.  She
notices a side door.  Only this time there are MEN with
MACHINE GUNS standing guard directly outside it.  This, after
all, is Rome.

With her hands pressed plaintively against the glass, she
watches as the plane taxis away from the gate toward the
runway, to join the LINE-UP of other PLANES waiting for
take-off clearance.  This jet, which we'll call "Peter's" jet,
is fifth in line.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL ENTRANCE - DAY

Kate and Larry come barrelling in.

INT. AIRPORT GIFT SHOP - DAY

Faith is buying one of those little portable Igloo ICE CHESTS.
With an "I    Italy" logo.  And an enormous roll of MASKING
TAPE.

A JET takes off.  Peter's jet moves up a notch.  Three to go.

INT. GATE NUMBER 7 - DAY

CLOSE ON the ICE CHEST.  With a lot of tape wrapped around
it.  And large lettering, "MEDICAL EMERGENCY" "DO NOT OPEN."
And a little red cross.  It looks pretty tacky.

               O.S.
     A heart transplant?!

               FAITH
     That's right.  She's been waiting
     a long time.

The clerk picks up the ice chest, starts trying to examine
it.  Faith stops him.

               FAITH
     I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
     Hearts are very fragile.

Somebody else comes up.  A SECURITY GUARD.  He and the clerk
start conversing Italian.

OUT THE WINDOW --

Faith sees another jet take off.  Two to go.

INSIDE --

Faith is anxiously looking from one authority to the to other,
vainly trying to follow their conversation.  Finally the guard
turns to her,

               CARABINIERE
     Who are you?

               FAITH
     I'm the cardiologist.

The Clerk eyes the ice chest suspiciously.

               CLERK
     You didn't have that with you
     before.
          (to the guard,
          pointing to the
          chest)
     Prima non l'aveva con se.

               FAITH
     It was late in arriving.
          (with import)
     But it's here now.

               CARABINIERE
     Do you have any I.D.?

               FAITH
     Look, I've given you my credit
     card, my passport number.  I've
     paid for the flight.  Now, while
     you two sit here cross-examining
     me, someone's future is hanging
     in the balance.

OUT ON THE RUNWAY --

The last jet in front of Peter's is given clearance.  It races
down the runway and disappears into the sky.  And Peter's jet
taxis into position.  ENGINES REVVING furiously.

INSIDE --

A whole flock of AIRPORT PERSONNEL are now conferring.  A
crowd of other ONLOOKERS have gathered.  A few of them start
mumbling opinions.

               FAITH
     It's a heart, for godssakes.  You
     guys are Italian.  Don't you get
     it?  It's the greatest gift one
     human being can give another.  Are
     you telling me you're going to
     stand there and deny her the chance
     of a lifetime?

A GUY in the crowd with a "Dianetics" book in one hand and
a cigarette in the other, tosses in his two cents,

               ONLOOKER
     Let the nut go...

                                   CUT TO:

INT. JET - DAY

               PILOT
     Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid
     we've got a temporary delay.  We
     have a medical emergency and are
     going to have to head back to the
     gate.

Passengers groan.  The engines wind down, and the plane taxis
off the runway, back toward the terminal.

EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

The portable stairs are being wheeled back toward the cabin
door.  Faith is waiting inside.  Triumphant.  When,

               LOUDSPEAKER
     Damon Bradley.  Signore Damon
     Bradley.  E pregato di recarsi
     all'ufficio informazione.

For a moment, for just a fraction of a second, she hesitates.

               LOUDSPEAKER
     Damon Bradley.  Mr. Damon Bradley,
     please meet your party at the
     information booth.

Then we see the decision has been made.  Ice chest in hand,
she strides confidently out the door toward the plane, without
a backward glance.

INT. AIRPORT INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY

Kate and Larry are waiting there.

               O.S.
     Larry Corbett?

Larry turns,

It's the smoker with the "Dianetics" volume.

               STRANGER
     I thought that was you.
          (he extends a hand)
     Damon Bradley.  Remember me?

He calls to a woman nearby,

               DAMON BRADLEY
     Honey...
          (to Larry)
     This is my wife, Arlene.
          (to her)
     Larry and I played in Little League
     together.

INT. JET - DAY

Faith walks up the steps and through the cabin door.  She
spots Peter seated about halfway back.  But he doesn't see
her.  He's staring blankly out the window.  She makes her way
to the open seat next to him.  He looks up.  Does a double
take.

               FAITH
     I brought you something.  Something
     I didn't want you to leave without.

She sits down.  Hands him the ice chest.  Puzzled, he opens
the cover.  Inside is a little chocolate heart.  He takes it
out, looks at it.

               PETER
     I was hoping for the real thing.

               FAITH
     I brought you that, too.

He looks at her.

               PETER
     You do know you're insane.

Beat.

               PETER
     I love that in a woman.

And the plane takes flight.  As we,

                                   FADE OUT
