               OPENING CRAWL ON A BLACK SCREEN

               "Medical journals report only 31 cases in history of people 
               swallowing their toothbrushes. The champion toothbrush 
               swallower was a Soviet psychiatric patient who downed 16 in 
               1984. The all-time champion swallower of any object swallowed 
               2533 objects in 1927."

               ECU: A TOOTHBRUSH - CREDITS ROLLING

               We HEAR a man clearing his throat. He enters and a shiny 
               glob of toothpaste is squeezed onto the bristles.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING

               BOB WILEY, thirties, anxious, begins brushing his teeth. 
               Suddenly, in trying to brush a back molar, Bob looses control 
               of the toothbrush and swallows half of it whole. Choking, 
               gasping, he tries to pull the toothbrush out.

               EXT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING, SAME

               PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets 
               of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob 
               struggling frantically with the toothbrush.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING

               Bob is losing the battle, and in three excruciating swallows, 
               like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush 
               disappears down his throat. Bob pounds his chest, swallowing 
               as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep 
               breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet. 
               There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.

               Pricey BMW's, MERCEDES, etc. sport license plates which read:

               ride by on bikes and shove the trunks of the cars. Car alarms 
               sound off like birds. We PAN WITH THE KIDS then PAST THEM 
               out to sea to see:

               EXT. THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE, ABOARD A CRIS CRAFT, SAME

               Four psychiatrists and three spouses are pleasure boating. 
               Here all is quiet except the wind and the sound of the birds 
               (or is it the car alarms?). Shrinks and their wives sit around 
               an intense doctor in his forties.

                                     DOCTOR 1 (FEINBERG)
                         I've had the same nightmare three 
                         nights running.

                         I'm leaving my office for summer 
                         vacation, when suddenly my patients 
                         rush up looking insane.

               EXT. A PARK AVENUE OFFICE BUILDING, DAY. DREAM-LIKE SLOW 
               MOTION

               Dr. Feinberg exits the building with his suitcase. To his 
               horror an angry horde of men and women, looking like a 
               sadistic lynch mob, swarm him and attack.

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         "Don't leave us!" they scream. Then 
                         they beat me and bite me and kill 
                         me...!

               As Feinberg runs to get away he is dragged down then overrun 
               by his angry patients.

                         It's the worst nightmare I've had

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN, UPPER WEST SIDE, DAY

               The SOUND of BIRDS segues to car alarms. We're on the streets 
               of New York, CRANING and ZOOMING like a bird up and into a 
               sweltering apartment.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT, SAME

               Bob Wiley sits on his bed in boxer shorts. On his night stand 
               are cardboard plaques: one lists the warning signs of 
               diabetes, another lists cancer's seven warning signals. 
               Stacked by the bed are psychology books and a few bottles of 
               prescription pills. In front of Bob is a vaporizer. Bob holds 
               his cheeks and twists them in small circles in front of the 
               steam.

                                     BOB

                         But who's Leo Marvin? I know I've 
                         heard the name.

               INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, DAY

               The striking thing about DR. LEO MARVIN's office is order 
               and neatness. As Marvin talks on the phone, he unconsciously 
               adjusts the already meticulously placed gewgaws on his desk. 
               Marvin is mid-forties, authoritative, stiff, perfectly 
               manicured. Adorning the office are diplomas, personal 
               mementos, primitive masks, Mondrian-like paintings, his framed 
               medical school grades, a bust of Freud, and diplomas. On his 
               desk is a book titled Baby Steps TM with Marvin's picture on 
               it.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Of course I want to publicize the 
                         book, Hugo and it's a wonderful 
                         opportunity, but its my vacation. 
                         The Today Show went to Dr. Ruth's 
                         vacation house, why can't CBS Morning 
                         come to Lake Winnipesaukee?... Would 
                         you work on it?... Thank you Hugo. I 
                         appreciate it.

                         Dr. Marvin, there's a Dr. Carswell 
                         Fensterwald calling. He says you 
                         went to school together.

                         Fensterwald. Carswell Fensterwald. 
                         It sounds familiar but... They sure 
                         come out of the woodwork when you 
                         get famous, Clair. Put him through.

                              (INTO SPEAKER PHONE)
                         Carswell?

               INT. ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, SAME

               Carswell Fensterwald looks unstable. As he talks on his phone, 
               he is boxing up his office. Prominent on his desk is a copy 
               of Marvin's book. The conversation INTERCUTS.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Long time no see, huh? You have a 
                         big book out. Things are clicking, 
                         huh?

                                     MARVIN
                         That's the way I planned it.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Listen, Leo, I'm closing my practice. 
                         Most of my patients are on the West 
                         Side but I have one case I'd like to 
                         refer you.

                                     MARVIN
                         Carswell, thanks but --

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         I know, you're incredibly busy.

                                     MARVIN
                         Swamped. I've raised my rate. I might 
                         even cut my sessions to forty 
                         minutes...

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Leo, I know you don't like flattery 
                         but if anybody I know is going to 
                         win a Nobel Prize, it's you. You 
                         gotta be thinking about your next 
                         book so I know you'll find this case 
                         particularly interesting.

                                     MARVIN
                         What sort of case is it, Carswell?

               Marvin paces. He adjusts a diploma down, then up, then down.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         Actually, Leo, I don't know.

                                     MARVIN
                         Carswell, if this is a dysfunctional --

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         No no, nothing like that. He keeps 
                         his appointments. Pays on time. See 
                         him once. If he's not the most complex 
                         and -- persistent -- case you've 
                         ever seen, drop him. His name's Bob 
                         Wiley. He needs someone brilliant.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay. I'll work him in for an 
                         interview. Say, Carswell, how come 
                         you're quitting the business?

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         We're a dying breed, Leo. Good luck.

               Fensterwald hangs up. He lets out a silent jubilant howl of 
               gleeful laughter.

                                     FENSTERWALD
                         I feel good. I feel great. I feel 
                         wonderful!

               ANGLE IN MARVIN'S OFFICE

               Marvin slowly hangs up his speaker phone.

                                     MARVIN
                         Carswell Fensterwald...?

               Again he racks his brains. He presses his intercom.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO INTERCOM)
                         Claire, if I get a call from a Bob 
                         Wiley, schedule him for a short 
                         interview after vacation.

                                     SECRETARY (CLAIRE)
                         He's already called, Dr. Marvin. 
                         Twice. He's coming in this afternoon.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's one kind of persistence. 
                         Carswell Fensterwald...?

               Marvin gives up. He picks up a copy of his book. He compares 
               his jacket photo with his reflection in the handle of his 
               letter opener.

                         was the name of it?

                                     FEINBERG
                         Watching grass grow was more exciting 
                         than Leo Marvin.

                                     PHIL
                         All that changed.

                                     DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
                         Why?

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you 
                         lummoxes: Bob.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, DAY

               Bob is sitting by the steam repeating his mantra.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good. I feel great. I feel 
                         wonderful! I feel good, I feel great! 
                         I feel --

               Bob picks up the phone and frantically pushes buttons.

                                     BOB
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello, Claire, Bob again. Are you 
                         sure Dr. Marvin doesn't have an 
                         earlier cancellation?... Sorry. See 
                         you at two, sharp.

               Bob hangs up, finds a blood pressure gauge and takes his 
               blood pressure. That done, he stands, paces, then stops and 
               sprinkles food into a gold fish bowl.

                                     BOB
                         Morning, Gil.

               GIL the GOLDFISH nibbles the food. Bob sits on his bed, takes 
               a deep breath, then dials the phone. As he waits for an 
               answer, he flips through his "organizer" which is crammed 
               with notes and papers.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                              (ON PHONE)

                                     BOB
                              (INTO HEADSET)
                         This is Bob Wiley calling...
                              (checks in his notebook)
                         Mrs. Patricia Lions please.

               Bob waits a beat, still looking through the notebook.

                                     MRS. LIONS
                              (ON PHONE)
                         Lions.

                                     BOB
                         Mrs. Lions, I'm Bob Wiley. I represent 
                         the Manhattan Dental Hygiene 
                         Association. I can offer you a forty

                                     MRS. LIONS
                         Mr. Wiley --

                                     BOB
                         Bob.

                                     MRS. LIONS
                         Bob, this is an elementary school.

                                     BOB
                         Elementary school?
                              (checks his notebook)
                         I thought you were Overton Cafeteria?

                                     MRS. LIONS
                              (ON PHONE)
                         No, we're a school and we don't need 
                         toothpicks.

                                     BOB
                         I don't know. A young tooth is a 
                         terrible thing to waste. I should 
                         know. When I was that age nobody 
                         gave a hoot about my teeth and now 
                         they're terrible! Have you checked 
                         out flavored floss?

                                     MRS. LIONS
                         Flavored floss?

                                     BOB
                         All you have to do is dream pink 
                         gums, Patsy, and we can make them 
                         happen. Give me your address and 
                         I'll send you our flossing catalogue.

               As Bob begins to write on his notebook, he flashes a "V" for 
               victory at Gil.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATER

               Bob is now dressed to go out. A clock reads 1:45pm. Bob is 
               pacing at the door. He stops, glances at the clock, faces 
               the door, opens it, closes it. He paces, opens the door, 
               takes some deep breaths, twists his cheeks, then like a man 
               jumping into cold water, bolts out.

               INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE BOB'S APARTMENT, SAME

               Bob exits his apartment, uses a Kleenex to close the door, 
               then heads down the stairs.

               EXT. THE DOORWAY TO BOB'S APARTMENT BUILDING, DAY

               Sweat pouring off his brow, Bob stands in sunglasses in the 
               entrance-way to his apartment. A bus squeals up to the curb, 
               belches smoke, then moves on. A garbage can is kicked over. 
               Bob starts to take a step when suddenly he gets dizzy. He 
               steps back and hyperventilates. Bob puts on a dust mask, 
               steps bravely onto the sidewalk, and walks, eyes fixed 
               forward.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.
                              (repeats)

               A man passes Bob, eyes fixed forward.

                                     MAN
                         Son of a bitch, dirty bastard, I'll 
                         get you!
                              (repeats)

               EXT. THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN, DAY. LONG SHOT

               Bob walks through the city like a zombie, eyes fixed forward.

               INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY, MANHATTAN, SAME

               Passers-by shuffle to and fro. Bob, still in sunglasses and 
               dust mask, enters. He walks in a straight line to the building 
               directory. He finds:

                 "Dr. Leo Marvin, A Psychiatric Corporation, suite 4616."

                                     DOORMAN (O.S.)
                         Help you?

               This startles Bob but he recovers.

                                     BOB
                         I'm going to see Dr. Leo Marvin.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Second elevator. 46th floor.

                                     BOB
                         Elevator. Thanks.

               ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS

               Bob removes a Kleenex from a pack in his pocket, uses it to 
               push the elevator button, then paces nervously. The elevator 
               arrives and the door opens. The elevator is filling up with 
               passengers. Bob doesn't move.

               INT. A STEEL AND CONCRETE STAIRWELL, SAME

               We see a descending steel staircase and stairwell door marked 
               "Floor 40". We hear footsteps -- rhythmic and determined -- 
               getting closer and closer.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.
                              (repeats over and 
                              over)

               INT. DR. MARVIN'S RECEPTION ROOM, DAY

               Clair sits behind her desk reading a book. Bob enters, red-
               faced and out of breath, taking his pulse.

                                     BOB
                         Hi... I'm... Bob...

               INT. DR. MARVIN'S OFFICE, DAY

               Dr. Marvin is at his desk. Claire shows in Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin. Bob Wiley. Thank you for 
                         working me in.

               Claire exits. Bob looks around then notices a framed photo 
               on Marvin's shelf. Using his Kleenex, Bob picks it up. He 
               smiles.

                                     BOB
                         Your family?
                              (Marvin nods)
                         Wait, let me guess. I'm good at this. 
                         Harriet, Kenny, Gretchen, Rita. Wait 
                         wait, I know I'm close. Susan, Steven, 
                         Andrea, Rita. Wait --

                                     MARVIN
                              (emotionless)
                         My wife, Fay. My son, Sigmund. My 
                         daughter, Anna. My sister, Lily.

                                     BOB
                         Lily... I was close! What a wonderful 
                         family!

               Bob puts the photo back on the shelf. Marvin adjusts it.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thank you.

                                     BOB
                         Do I call you Dr. Marvin or Leo?

                                     MARVIN
                         Whichever you prefer. Have a seat.

                                     BOB
                         Call me Bob.

               Bob stares at the chair. There is a box of Kleenexes on the 
               arm. Bob reaches in his pocket, takes out a Kleenex, and 
               uses it to move the box of Kleenexes to the table. He then 
               sits. Marvin walks to Bob and holds out a trash can. Bob 
               drops in the used Kleenex.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you.

               Marvin puts the trash can next to Bob's chair then sits. He 
               stares at Bob. He's waiting.

                                     BOB
                         I guess I'm on, huh?
                              (pause)
                         Well, the simplest way to put it is, 
                         I have problems. I worry er, about 
                         diseases. I have trouble with 
                         toothbrushes. And I, er, I have 
                         problems moving.

                                     MARVIN
                         Talk about moving.

                                     BOB
                         As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm 
                         okay. I have a phone job -- selling 
                         dental supplies -- and that's fine. 
                         But when I have to go out, I get..., 
                         weird.

                                     MARVIN
                         Talk about weird.

                                     BOB
                         I get dizzy spells. Nausea. Cold 
                         sweats. Hot sweats. Fever blisters. 
                         Difficulty swallowing. Difficulty 
                         breathing. Blurred vision. Involuntary 
                         trembling. Dead hands. Weak ankles. 
                         Twitching. Fainting spells. Numb 
                         lips.
                              (pause)
                         Do you think that's normal?

                                     MARVIN
                         That depends.

               Suddenly Bob removes an air sickness bag from his pocket. He 
               opens it and pauses a long time as though he were about to 
               vomit into it. He doesn't. He puts the air sickness bag away. 
               Marvin leans in. Bob does too.

                                     MARVIN
                         You do go out, you know.

                                     BOB
                         I do?

                                     MARVIN
                         You came here.

                                     BOB
                         You're right!

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you afraid of?

                                     BOB
                         Well. What if I break my neck and 
                         become paraplegic? What if my heart 
                         stops beating, or I can't find a 
                         bathroom and my bladder explodes? 
                         You ever heard of Tourette's Syndrome. 
                         You know, where you involuntarily 
                         shout profanity?

                                     MARVIN
                         That's exceptionally rare.

                                     BOB
                         I have a neighbor who got it. Yells 
                         "oh shit!" in church. "Douche bag!" 
                         at customers at his job. Pretty funny, 
                         actually, unless you're the one with 
                         the disease. Then it's sad.
                              (pause)
                         OH SHIT EATING SON OF A BITCH! Just 
                         kidding.
                              (pause)
                         TWAT LOVING DOUCHE BAG!

                                     MARVIN
                         Why are you doing this?

                                     BOB
                         Sometimes, if I fake it, I know I 
                         don't have it. Like, when I think my 
                         heart is gonna stop. I fake it so I 
                         know it's not happening.

               Bob fakes a heart seizure -- very convincingly -- and falls 
               to the floor. After a moment, he sits back in the chair as 
               if nothing had happened.

                                     BOB
                         If I can't make it happen, I know 
                         it's not happening. I know it's all 
                         in my mind.

               Marvin stands and walks towards Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Get away from me with that knife!
                              (laughs)
                         See?

               Marvin uprights the trashcan and walks back to his seat.

                                     MARVIN
                         Are you married?

                                     BOB
                         Divorced, actually.

                                     MARVIN
                         Want to talk about it?

                                     BOB
                         The world is divided into two types 
                         of people: those who like Neil Diamond 
                         and those who don't. My ex-wife loves 
                         him.

                                     MARVIN
                         Um.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin, do you think you can 
                         help me?

               There is a pause. Marvin leans in.

                                     MARVIN
                         There's a saying, Bob, that the best 
                         psychiatrist in the world is right 
                         inside of you. I can help you, 
                         provided you're willing to help 
                         yourself.

                                     BOB
                         Are you kidding, I'll do anything!

               Marvin stands and moves to the bookcase behind him.

                                     MARVIN
                         There's a ground breaking book that 
                         just came out, Bob. Not everything 
                         in it applies to you but when you 
                         see the title, I think you'll see 
                         that it can help.

               There are twenty copies of Marvin's book on the shelf behind 
               Marvin. Marvin holds one up. Bob sees the cover. We see the 
               picture of Marvin on the back.

                                     BOB
                         Baby Steps.

                                     MARVIN
                         It means setting small, reasonable 
                         goals for yourself. One day at a 
                         time, one tiny step at a time -- do-
                         able, accomplishable goals.

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps.

                                     MARVIN
                         When you leave this office, don't 
                         think about everything you have to 
                         do to get out of the building, just 
                         deal with getting out of the room. 
                         When you reach the hall, just deal 
                         with the hall. And so forth. Baby 
                         steps.

               Bob looks at Marvin then stands.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step... through the office.

               Bob takes small deliberate steps to the door. He opens it 
               and steps into the reception area.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Baby step... out the door.

               The door to the office closes. There is a long pause. Bob 
               opens the door and pops back in.

                                     BOB
                         It works!

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course.

                                     BOB
                         All I have to do is take one small 
                         step at a time and I can do anything!

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. But don't expect everything 
                         all at once. Even a baby occasionally 
                         falls and hits his head.

               Bob walks around the room as though he were inhabiting each 
               small space with his body.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step around the office. Baby 
                         step around the office!
                              (to Marvin's family 
                              photo)
                         Fay, Sigmund, Anna, Lily: Hi fam! 
                         He's a genius!

               Marvin hands Bob the book.

                                     MARVIN
                         This will give you plenty to digest 
                         while I'm on vacation.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation?

                                     MARVIN
                         Certainly my secretary told you. As 
                         of this afternoon, I'm on vacation 
                         with my family until Labor Day.

                                     BOB
                         That's a whole month! What if I need 
                         you? What if I need to talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         Dr. Harmon, my associate will be 
                         happy to talk.

               He hands Bob Harmon's card.

                                     MARVIN
                         We have years ahead of us, Bob. A 
                         month will seem like a baby second.

               Marvin shows Bob the door. Bob, doing his baby steps, looks 
               lost and confused.

                                     BOB
                         Can I call you in the Hamptons if I 
                         need you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Dr. Harmon is quite skilled.

               Bob shuffles to the door.

                                     BOB
                         I hear Maine is great this time of 
                         year.

               Marvin turns over his book and shows Bob his picture.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll be with you the whole month. 
                         Try your baby steps.

                                     BOB
                         Let's see... Baby step through the 
                         office. Baby step out the door.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's perfect. Keep going...

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Baby steps to the hall. Baby...

               Marvin closes the door and starts back to his desk. 
               Momentarily, Bob sticks his head back in.

                                     BOB
                         It's the Catskills, isn't it?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Sorry. Baby steps. Baby steps...

               Bob exits, closing the door. Marvin starts to pick up Bob's 
               trash can when Bob sticks his head in again.

                                     BOB
                         You flying or driving?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob.
                              (firmly re-assuring)
                         I'll be back.

               Bob looks at Marvin then starts out.

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps, he'll be back. Baby steps, 
                         he'll be back...

               Bob closes the door behind him. From his desk Marvin takes a 
               plastic trash bag and dumps the contents of Bob's trash can 
               into it. He picks up a small tape recorder and presses 
               "record".

                                     MARVIN
                         July 31, Bob Wiley, introductory 
                         interview. Multi-phobic personality 
                         characterized by an extreme need for 
                         family connections. Bill $150 for 
                         the session and $29.95 for the book.

               He clicks the tape recorder off. There is a knock on the 
               door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

               Claire puts her head in.

                                     CLAIRE
                         It's your publicist. He says CBS 
                         will come to Winnipesaukee.

               Marvin strides triumphantly to the phone and lifts it up.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         I knew they'd come to me! Hugo, not 
                         to change the subject but has a 
                         psychiatrist ever won the Nobel Prize?

               INT. THE HALLWAY OF MARVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING, SAME

               Bob paces in front of the elevators, reading the book.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to the elevator. Baby step 
                         to the elevator.

               The elevator, full of passengers, opens. Bob, steps in.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to the elevator. Baby step 
                         to the elevator.

               The elevator doors close and it starts down. Bob screams.

               EXT. THE NEW YORK MARINE AIR TERMINAL, DAY

               Marvin and family (who we recognize from the pictures in 
               Marvin's office) exit a cab with their luggage and head into 
               the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry hurry. 
                         Hurry hurry hurry.

               They pass a HOMELESS MAN with a hand out. Marvin's wife FAY 
               stops and roots in her purse.

                                     MARVIN
                         Honey there isn't time.

               Fay gives the man some money then enters the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're only encouraging them, Fay.

               INT. THE MARINE AIR TERMINAL, SAME

               The Marvin family hurries through the terminal.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hurry hurry hurry. Hurry hurry 
                         hurry...

               Marvin's 16 year old daughter ANNA and 12 year old son SIGMUND 
               rush with them.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, would you cut it out?

               The family finds their gate and gets in line to board. There 
               are ten people ahead of them and the plane isn't boarding 
               yet. All haste stops as they drop their luggage to the floor.

                                     ANNA
                         See?

                                     FAY
                         Honey, I told you there was no rush.

               A nice looking BOY gets in line behind them and checks out 
               Anna. She sees him and flips her hair. Siggy, dressed in all 
               black, plays a video game on his watch. It beeps and blurps. 
               FAY lovingly plucks a piece of lint off Marvin's jacket. 
               Siggy looks up and plucks off another piece of lint. Marvin 
               takes out an electronic organizer. He pushes buttons and it 
               beeps.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay, how does this sound? Tomorrow: 
                         we'll go shopping and clean up the 
                         house.

                                     SIGGY
                         Ooo, sounds great.

                                     MARVIN
                         Wednesday we'll re-arrange the 
                         furniture and spruce up the lawn.

                                     SIGGY
                         More, I gotta have more.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thursday...

               Marvin clears his throat and smiles.

                                     FAY, ANNA, SIGGY
                              (sing song)
                         The interview with Maria Shriver.

                                     MARVIN
                              (swelling with pride)
                         I'm having some art brought up from 
                         the city. The cottage should look 
                         spectacular.

               Fay kisses Marvin on the cheek.

                                     FAY
                         I'm sure whatever you do will look 
                         wonderful, honey.

               Marvin beams then goes back to his organizer.

                                     MARVIN
                         After the interview we'll take a 
                         celebration sail around lake, then 
                         Friday -- my birthday -- we'll have 
                         wonderful meal at Digby's.

               Fay straightens Siggy's shirt tail. Momentarily, Siggy's 
               watch lets out a staccato series of beeps.

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, are you going to spend all 
                         summer driving us crazy with that?

                                     SIGGY
                         It's not driving me crazy.

                                     ANNA
                         Me either.

               Siggy continues his game. Fay touches Marvin on the hand to 
               say, let it pass. Anna continues to flirt with the boy in 
               line. Marvin pushes a couple of buttons on his organizer and 
               it lets out three rapid beeps. Siggy smiles triumphantly at 
               Marvin.

                                     SIGGY
                         You gonna do that all summer?

               Marvin ignores this and puts the organizer away.

                                     ANNA
                         Yeah, dad, huh?

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna you're masking hostility.

               Marvin reaches in his briefcase and removes two HAND PUPPETS. 
               One has the silk screened face of Anna, the other of Leo. 
               Anna sees this and is incredibly embarrassed.

                                     ANNA
                              (intense)
                         Daddy, put those away!

               The line moves. Anna hurries into the ramp way.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna. Examine your behavior.

               Marvin and the family disappear into the ramp way.

               INT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK, DAY, CLOSE ON

               A long list of airline phone numbers with all but the last 
               one crossed out. PULL BACK TO FIND:

               BOB standing at a pay phone, receiver to his ear. He has 
               Kleenexes protecting his hand, his ear and his mouth. Outside 
               the window is a hot dog stand. The vendor is serving up juicy 
               hot dogs and Bob watches longingly.

                                     OPERATOR'S VOICE
                              (OVER PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Bob. No one's answering 
                         the page.

                                     BOB
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Thanks for trying.

               Bob hangs up and crumples the list.

               EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH, SAME

               Still looking at the hot dogs, Bob shuffles out of the phone 
               booth. He tosses his crumpled list at a trash can and misses. 
               Even though there is litter on the street all around the 
               trash can, Bob (using a Kleenex) picks up his list and puts 
               it in the trash. He walks to the hot dog stand and watches. 
               He wants a hot dog.

                         Bob.

                         I sure would...

               The vendor buns a hot dog.

                         I sure would.

                         I'd love it.

               The vendor holds out the dog.

                                     BOB
                         But I can't. I really want to but I 
                         can't. It's bird intestine and beef 
                         brain.

               Bob looks at the dog with a mixture of desire and revulsion. 
               He pulls out an air sickness bag, holds it ready, then puts 
               it back. The vendor retracts the dog.

                                     VENDOR
                         Hit the road, bub.

                         Bob.

               Bob moves on.

               INT. A SUNNY NEW YORK FLAT, DAY

               Bob, out of breath, knocks on the door. HELENE WILEY, a late 
               middle aged woman draped in diaphanous scarves, opens the 
               door. She carries a palette knife and palette of paint.

                                     BOB
                         Hi, mom.

                                     HELENE
                         Bob, you didn't walk up again?

                                     BOB
                         I found this great psychiatrist who 
                         abandoned me.

               Helene turns and walks away. Bob follows her in. The next 
               scene is played with Helene walking away and Bob following. 
               They move through her apartment, dotted with finished and 
               half-finished paintings on big canvases.

                                     HELENE
                         Did you come here for money?

                                     BOB
                         Mom, that's a terrible thing to ask.

                                     HELENE
                         How do you like my latest?

               She stops in front of a BIG CANVAS covered with knives, 
               spoons, forks, paint, and twenty dollar bills. Bob touches 
               one of the twenties. It comes off in his hand.

                                     BOB
                         It's lovely mom.

               Helene takes the twenty and puts it back.

                                     HELENE
                         Bobby, please!

                                     BOB
                         Mom, I'm sorry! All I wanted to do 
                         was talk. I'll go.

               She reaches out and embraces him.

                                     HELENE
                         Oh my poor baby. How did you get so 
                         screwed up?

                                     BOB
                         Oh, mom.

                                     HELENE
                         You're the only thing I care about. 
                         Always will be.

                                     BOB
                         Oh mom.

               They stand there hugging for a moment.

                                     HELENE
                         I'm here for you, Bob. Anytime.

                                     BOB
                         I love you, mom.

               She looks at him and lovingly straightens his hair.

                                     HELENE
                         Go home, sweetie. I need to work.

               EXT. A STREET CORNER NEAR THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, SAME

               Bob stands on the corner looking like a lost soul. He watches 
               as the world passes by. The light changes. Looking both ways 
               constantly, Bob crosses.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step across the street. Baby 
                         step across the street...

               A "perfect little family" walks past him. A five year old 
               girl and a three year old boy skip by, hand in hand. They 
               wave at Bob. He waves back, sadly, then continues.

                                     BOB
                              (affectless)
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         wonderful.

               INT. A BABY DECORATED APARTMENT, DAY

               "Crackling Rose" by Neil Diamond plays on the stereo. BECKY, 
               a perky woman, pregnant, about Bob's age, answers the door. 
               Bob stands in the hallway. She's a little surprised.

                                     BECKY
                         Hi.

                                     BOB
                         Whoa!... You're really getting big.

               Bob gently puts his hand on Becky's belly.

                                     BOB
                         What a bruiser. Hi little Bobby!

                                     BECKY
                              (gently)
                         Bob, he's not little Bobby. Feel the 
                         heartbeat?

               Bob puts his ear to Becky's belly and listens. Suddenly, he 
               hugs Becky's tummy.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, Becky, let's get married again.

                                     BECKY
                              (pulling away)
                         Bob. You know I'm married to some 
                         one else now.

                                     BOB
                              (holding on)
                         But I want a baby. A family! I want 
                         to burp him and change him and... 
                         love him!
                              (pause -- lets go)
                         Why couldn't it have been with me?

                                     BECKY
                         Bob, honey, we've been over this. 
                         You as a father? Think about it.

               Bob sinks. Becky looks at him sympathetically. There is still 
               a warm spot in her heart for him.

                                     BECKY
                         You know I actually have considered 
                         naming him "Bob".

                                     BOB
                         Really?!

                                     BECKY
                         Yeah. But it's still going to be 
                         "Neil".

                                     BOB
                              (recognizing Neil 
                              Diamond on the stereo)
                         Right.

               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATE AFTERNOON

               Bob sits alone watching Ozzie and Harriet. Ozzie is talking 
               to Ricky, David, and Harriet.

                                     OZZIE
                         We're a family. We'll always be a 
                         family. I don't care what they say 
                         about you at school, we've got each 
                         other and don't you ever forget it.

               The family hugs. The TV audience applauds. Bob picks up the 
               phone and dials. SPLIT SCREEN with MID-MANHATTAN EXCHANGE a

                              (INTO PHONE)
                         This is Bob Wiley. I'm a patient of 
                         Dr. Marvin's. I need to talk to him. 
                         Urgently.

                                     BESSIE
                         I'm sorry Mr. Wiley --

                                     BOB
                         Bob.

                                     BESSIE
                         -- Bob, but Dr. Marvin is out of 
                         town and Dr. Harmon is taking his 
                         calls.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want Harmon, I need Marvin!

               Bob paces then assumes a false calm.

                                     BOB
                         Look, there seems to be some 
                         confusion. You see, Dr. Marvin, uh, 
                         Leo, wanted me to call him but I 
                         lost his number.

                                     BESSIE
                         Bob. I can't give out that number.

                                     BOB
                         But you could call him and ask him 
                         to call me.

                                     BESSIE
                         It's awfully late.

               Bob is silent. Bessie is uncertain.

                                     BESSIE
                         Stay on the line, Bob. What's your 
                         number in case we get disconnected?

               EXT. MARVIN'S VACATION HOUSE PORCH, LATE AFTERNOON

               We recognize this as the same lake the doctors were sailing 
               in the opening scene: gorgeous greenery, the shore lined 
               with quaint but expensive summer homes. Where the doctors in 
               the boat saw an empty slab, stands the Marvin summer house, 
               a clapboard structure complete with a private dock, old wooden 
               motorized rowboat, and diving board.

               Marvin is relaxing in a chair. Fay is in the background 
               putting out flowers. Marvin takes a deep breath, sighs 
               peacefully then picks up a book: Freud's Understanding Dreams 
               and opens it. The phone rings. Marvin frowns, then answers.

                         Yes?

                                     BESSIE
                         Dr. Marvin, this is Bessie at your 
                         exchange. I'm sorry to disturb you 
                         but I have a Bob Wiley on the line 
                         who says you'll want to talk to him.

                                     MARVIN
                         You know better than this, Bessie. 
                         Dr. Harmon is covering for me.

                                     BESSIE
                         I told him that, Doctor, but he 
                         insists on talking to you. He says 
                         it's an emergency.

               Marvin frowns then takes a deep breath.

                                     MARVIN
                         Put him through.

                                     BESSIE
                         Go ahead, Bob.

               BACK TO DOUBLE SPLIT-SCREEN

               Bob's frantic pacing contrasts with Marvin's calm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, I thought I made it clear to 
                         you that I'm on vacation.

                                     BOB
                         I know, but I'm a mess. Worse than 
                         usual.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, if this is an emergency, go to 
                         the emergency room. If not, call Dr. 
                         Harmon and I'm sure he can help you.

                                     BOB
                         I'd feel better if I just knew where 
                         you were. It's Martha's Vineyard 
                         right?

                                     MARVIN

                         Couldn't we just talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         In my office, after Labor Day.

                         Good night, Bob.

               Marvin hangs up. SINGLE SCREEN. Bob hangs up too. He stands 
               and thinks then dials again. SPLIT SCREEN WITH MID-MANHATTAN

                         off.

                                     BESSIE
                         I'm sorry, Bob, but Dr. Marvin just 
                         called and instructed me not to put 
                         you through.

                                     BOB
                         What?

               Bob stands thinking.

               INT. A MANHATTAN PAY PHONE BOOTH, NIGHT

               A mid-twenties PROSTITUTE, overly made up, is on the phone.

                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello, this is Lily Marvin, Dr. Leo 
                         Marvin's sister. I have to talk to 
                         my brother right away.

                                     BESSIE
                              (skeptical)
                         I'm not allowed to give out that 
                         number. Don't you have it?

               A PULL BACK REVEALS BOB standing beside the prostitute, 
               wearing his face mask, waiting anxiously. Bob whispers in 
               the prostitute's ear. She nods.

                                     PROSTITUTE
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         He went on vacation and forgot to 
                         give it to me. Look, honey, it's 
                         urgent. I'm at: 790-8864.

               She reads the number off the pay phone. Bessie reacts to the 
               fact that it's a different number from Bob's. She shakes her 
               head and sighs.

                                     BESSIE
                         Stay on the line, Miss Marvin.

               The prostitute hands the phone to Bob. He sprays the phone 
               with disinfectant then hands her some money.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks. You were fantastic.

               The prostitute shakes her head and walks away.

               The moonlit lake is in the far background. In the near 
               background the Marvin family sits eating dinner. Marvin 
               holding the telephone, looking concerned, walks off by 
               himself.

                                     MARVIN
                         Lily? What's wrong?

               SPLIT SCREEN WITH Bob, standing at his pay phone. He cringes.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin, please don't be angry. 
                         It's Bob. I know I shouldn't call 
                         this way but --

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, listen to me. The doctor-patient 
                         relationship is based on trust. When 
                         you call me against my wishes or 
                         pretend to be my sister, I can't 
                         trust you any more.

                                     BOB
                         I know but--

                                     MARVIN
                         Call Dr. Harmon, or go to the 
                         emergency room, but don't call me 
                         here again.

               Marvin hangs up. BACK TO SINGLE SCREEN. Bob stands in the 
               phone booth, banging his hand on his head.

                                     BOB
                         Oh that wasn't smart! Oh that wasn't 
                         smart...

               He walks out of the booth shaking his head. He exits screen 
               left. Momentarily he crosses back through screen, muttering 
               to himself.

                              (to Gwen)
                         That was that sicko who kept calling

                              (loud)
                         What about him?

               She opens the door. Detective Roberts is Bob.

                         Suicide. We think. Forty stories. 
                         Free fall. Splat.

               The operators gasp.

                                     BOB
                         Now our records show that Bob made 
                         several calls to this number just 
                         before he died. Did either of you 
                         know Bob personally?

                         I put him through once. After that, 
                         Dr. Marvin didn't want to talk to 
                         him again.

                         Wait a minute. Dr. Marvin couldn't 
                         have had anything to do with Bob's 
                         death.

                         That's okay. I'm sure we can find 
                         him if we need him.

               Bob writes down the information as he walks to the door.

                                     BESSIE
                         God, I feel terrible. What if I was 
                         the last person he talked to before 
                         he died?

                                     BOB
                         I frankly wouldn't let it bother me. 
                         This guy had "sky diver" written all 
                         over him if you know what I mean.

               Bob closes the door behind him.

               EXT. THE ANSWERING SERVICE HALLWAY, SAME

               Bob almost throws up then puts the air sickness bag away 
               again. He takes a deep breath, smiles to himself, then exits.

               INT. MARVIN'S SUMMER HOUSE BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Marvin and Fay are asleep in bed. The phone rings. Fay turns 
               on the light.

                                     MARVIN
                         That'd better not be who I think it 
                         is.

               Marvin answers the phone. Fay listens.

                                     MARVIN (INTO PHONE)
                         Hello... What?... That's okay. Thanks 
                         for calling, Bessie.

               Marvin hangs up. He sits, stunned.

                                     MARVIN
                         That was my service. That patient -- 
                         the one who called earlier -- 
                         committed suicide.

                                     FAY
                         Oh Leo, how horrible.

               Fay rubs Marvin's neck. There is a long pause.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh well. Let's not let it ruin our 
                         vacation.

               Marvin turns out the light and lies down.

               INT. A BUS STATION, MORNING

               Bob wears bermuda shorts and baseball cap. In one hand, like 
               a security blanket, he clutches a paper bag spilling over 
               with clothes, bottles of pills, and Baby Steps. In the other 
               hand he clutches a baggie holding Gil. Eyes fixed ahead, Bob 
               stares at:

               A BUS looming large like a growling grumbling snorting 
               monster.

               BUS EMPLOYEE APPROACHES

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         This is the last bus to Winnipesaukee, 
                         Bob.

                                     BOB
                         How many tunnels does it pass through 
                         again? How many bridges?

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         If you keep your eyes closed, you 
                         won't see any of them. You ready?

                                     BOB
                         Baby steps, board the bus. Baby steps, 
                         board the bus.

               Bob looks at the bus again. He tips his bottle of pills and 
               swallows. He takes a small baby step towards the bus.

                                     BUS EMPLOYEE
                         You think you could do it today, 
                         Bob. We have a baby schedule to keep.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step, board today. Baby step, 
                         board today.

               Bob inches into the bus.

               INT. THE BUS, SAME

               A bus driver sits ready to go. Bob walks like a cripple down 
               the aisle to an empty seat.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step, down the aisle. Baby step, 
                         down the aisle.

               The passengers, a scurvy bunch, wait impatiently. Bob finally 
               takes a seat next to an old man and smiles nervously.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. I'm Bob.

               The old man scowls and looks forward. The bus driver closes 
               the door and the bus moves forward with a jolt.

                                     BOB
                         Ah!!
                              (turns to the old man)
                         Would you knock me out, please?! Hit 
                         me in the face, whatever you have to 
                         do, just knock me out!

               The old man moves away. Bob downs more pills.

               INT. THE HOLLAND TUNNEL, DAY

               The bus speeds through. We HEAR a long, loud SCREAM.

               EXT. THE MARVIN PORCH, DAY

               Marvin lies down in the hammock and picks up his book. Fay 
               enter.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, let's go to the store.

               EXT. THE OPEN COUNTRYSIDE, DAY

               The Greyhound bus stops. Bob gets out and runs into a field. 
               He apparently vomits, then runs back to the bus.

               INT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, DAY

               The Marvin family strolls through this old fashioned General 
               Store, loading food and supplies into a shopping cart. They're 
               all in shorts and looking resorty except for Siggy who is in 
               his usual all-black garb. Through the windows, outside, we 
               can see the quaint little town of Winnipesaukee.

                                     MARVIN
                         Hugo said to expect eleven. Are you 
                         sure we have enough?

                                     FAY
                         We could feed the entire network, 
                         honey. Relax.

               Anna joins them and tosses in some cookies.

                                     MARVIN
                              (to Anna)
                         By the way, did you call Ted Fein?

                                     ANNA
                         Why? He's a salami with eyes.

                                     MARVIN
                         I thought he was cute.

                                     ANNA
                         How would you know a boy is cute? 
                         Are you coming out of the closet?

                                     FAY
                         Anna. Be nice.
                              (she fixes Anna's 
                              collar)

                                     MARVIN
                              (calmly)
                         She's just testing us, Fay. But don't 
                         get psycho-sexual with me young lady.

                                     ANNA
                         Me? When you want me to call some 
                         guy cause his father's your publicist?

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, dad. Don't be a psychosexual 
                         pimp.

                                     FAY
                         Siggy, don't talk that way to your 
                         father.

                                     MARVIN
                         They're both testing us, Fay. Don't 
                         buy into it.

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, mom. It's not meant for you, 
                         it's meant for dad.
                              (at his father)
                         Testing. 1, 2, 3. Testing.

               EXT. THE BUS STOP ACROSS FROM THE GENERAL STORE, DAY

               A GREYHOUND BUS pulls to the bus stop. Passengers hurry off, 
               anxiously glancing behind them. Finally Bob, covered in sweat, 
               exits. Holding his bag and fish, squinting to adjust to the 
               sun, he stands in a daze as the bus pulls away. After a long 
               pause, Bob calls out.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!

               Bob waits. Passers-by turn and stare. There is no Leo Marvin 
               in sight.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! Dr. Leo Marvin!

               EXT. THE GENERAL STORE, SAME

               The Marvin family exits carrying groceries. They stop at the 
               family station wagon and begin loading up.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Dr. Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, is somebody calling you?

                                     MARVIN
                         I didn't hear anything.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Leo Marvin. Dr. Leo Marvin!

               Everyone looks around.

                                     FAY
                         Over there.

               Marvin turns and sees Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh my god... I don't believe it.

               AT THE BUS STOP

               Bob looks in all directions. Suddenly he sees Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin. It's you!!

               Bob walks toward the Marvins.

               MARVIN

               stands dumfounded. He watches Bob walking towards them. He 
               tries to stay calm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Everybody get in the car.

                                     FAY
                         Do you know that man, Leo?

                                     BOB
                         Dr. Marvin! It's me, Bob!

                                     MARVIN
                              (intense)
                         Get in the car.

               Fay is surprised to see Leo so forceful. She hustles the 
               kids into the station wagon. Bob hurries up, out of breath. 
               In one hand he holds his bag. In the other he holds Gil in a 
               baggie. Marvin closes the station wagon door and stands 
               outside.

                                     BOB
                         Hi! This is Gil. It must be fate 
                         that I found you so quickly!

               Bob stops and stands, a little out of breath.

                                     BOB
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you doing here? I thought 
                         you were..., dead.

                                     BOB
                         Oh no, they told you? I fibbed a 
                         little but... Don't be mad.
                              (spotting the family 
                              in the car)
                         Oh...

               A sweet beatific smile appears on Bob's face. He sighs.

                                     BOB
                         The fam.

               Marvin leads Bob away from the car, across the street.

               EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PARKING LOT, SAME

               Marvin stops and faces Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I think you know, Bob, that your 
                         behavior is entirely inappropriate. 
                         We talked about trust. We talked 
                         about my needs. I want you to get on 
                         a bus and go back to New York.

                                     BOB
                         You're angry.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't get angry.

                                     BOB
                         You're upset.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't get upset.

                                     BOB
                         Then can't we just talk?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't see patients on vacation, 
                         Bob. Ever. How many ways can I make 
                         that clear?

                                     BOB
                         But you can't just send me away! 
                         I've read your book, I've been doing 
                         what you told me, but I've completely 
                         relapsed! A little time would mean 
                         so much. Please.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, I'm driving away now and I don't 
                         want you to bother me again. You 
                         came for my advice, correct?

                                     BOB
                         Absolutely.

                                     MARVIN
                         Then take my advice and go back to 
                         New York.

                                     BOB
                         But I can't go anywhere! I'm all 
                         locked up!

                                     MARVIN
                         You got yourself here.

                                     BOB
                         Barely!

                                     MARVIN
                         Getting back will therapeutic.

               Bob starts begging.

                                     BOB
                         Please just talk to me. Just a little 
                         talk.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're testing my patience, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         A teeny tiny talk. An itty bitty 
                         talk...

               ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CAR, WHAT THE FAMILY SEES

               Bob is kneeling in front of Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Pretty please... Pretty please with 
                         sugar...

               The family exchanges quizzical looks.

               BACK TO BOB AND MARVIN

               Marvin looks around, incredibly embarrassed. He tugs at the 
               kneeling Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                              (gritted teeth)
                         Get up. Come on, get up.

                                     BOB
                              (standing)
                         Say you will. Please, say you will.

               Marvin looks at his watch.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, it's two o'clock. Go to the bus 
                         station, buy a ticket home, then 
                         wait in that restaurant.

               He points to "GUTTMAN'S" coffee shop.

                                     BOB
                         You'll meet me?!

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll call you.
                              (looks at his watch)
                         In two hours.

                                     BOB
                         Oh my god, you're the greatest!

               Bob moves to hug Marvin and Marvin reluctantly lets him.

                                     MARVIN
                         But you must buy your ticket and 
                         give your word that you'll go home. 
                         This is all about trust again, Bob. 
                         We must have trust.

                                     BOB
                         I trust. I absolutely trust. I'll go 
                         buy my ticket. Right now!

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll call you at four.

                                     BOB
                         You couldn't possibly make it three 
                         thirty, could you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Four it is. Four o'clock exactly. 
                         Thank you, Dr. M.

               Bob starts across the parking lot as Marvin gets in the car 
               and closes the door.

               INT. THE MARVIN FAMILY STATION WAGON, SAME

               As the car pulls out of the parking lot, Marvin's family 
               turns to look at Bob. Bob smiles and waves at the family.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, you look disturbed.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm fine.

                                     FAY
                         Who was that poor man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody.

               Anna is looking out the back window at Bob. She waves.

                                     ANNA
                         He's cute.

               Marvin hits the accelerator, leaving rubber.

               INT. GUTTMAN'S COFFEE SHOP, LATER

               An ELDERLY COUPLE tend to the counters and glasses. Bob paces 
               by the phone, reading Baby Steps to himself. The clock on 
               the wall reads three o'clock.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step to four o'clock. Baby step 
                         to four o'clock.

               Bob covers his eyes then looks at the clock. No luck. 
               Frustrated, Bob paces again.

                                     BOB
                         I feel good, I feel great, I feel 
                         four o'clock!

               Again he looks at the clock: three-o-one. The elderly couple 
               watch. They speak with thick European accents.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN (MRS. GUTTMAN)
                         Sonny, your fishy's losing air.

                                     BOB
                         Huh?

                                     ELDERLY MAN (MR. GUTTMAN)
                         Your guppy.

               Bob looks at Gil. The baggie is dripping.

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Thanks.

               Bob looks for something to do about the dripping baggie. Mr. 
               Guttman brings a glass and dumps Gil in.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         Is there something we can help you 
                         with?

                                     BOB
                         Can you make it four o'clock? Dr. 
                         Marvin's supposed to call me then 
                         but I'm going crazy.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Not Dr. Leo Marvin?

                                     BOB
                         Do you know him?

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         He bought our dream house. We worked 
                         a lifetime, saved up for a down 
                         payment, then he swooped down with 
                         his fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed 
                         it out from under us.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         Stay as far away from him as possible.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Like the plague.

                                     BOB
                         No problem. I'm his patient but he 
                         doesn't want me near him.

                                     MR. GUTTMAN
                         We'll show you where he lives.

               EXT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin and Siggy march to the end of the Marvin dock. There 
               is a diving board. Siggy stands in a black terry robe and 
               flip flops.

                                     MARVIN
                         Take off your robe. Everything you 
                         wear is black. I wish you'd get off 
                         this death fixation.

               Siggy reluctantly takes off his black robe. Under it he wears 
               a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.

                                     SIGGY
                         How do you know it's a death fixation? 
                         Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost 
                         childhood.

                                     MARVIN
                         What do you mean by that?

                                     SIGGY
                         What do you mean by asking?

                                     MARVIN
                         Come on, get on the board and let's 
                         see your approach.

                                     SIGGY
                              (striking a pose)
                         My approach is to be suave and 
                         debonair and sophisticated.

                                     MARVIN
                         Come on, Siggy. 1, 2, 3 spring. Like 
                         we learned last time. 1, 2, 3, spring.

               Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together, 
               then takes a step with his right foot.

                                     SIGGY
                         1, 2, 3 spring. 1, 2, 3 summer. 1, 
                         2, 3 fall. Time to go dad.

                                     MARVIN
                         Cut it out, Siggy. Left foot...

                                     SIGGY
                         This is no fun.

               Siggy sighs then starts again. He awkwardly takes two steps 
               then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water, 
               afraid to dive.

                                     MARVIN
                         Why didn't you dive?

                                     SIGGY
                         With all the horror that's going on 
                         in the world, what difference does 
                         it make?

               INT. MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo 
               Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund 
               Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy, 
               Fay, and Leo. Anna is at the family stereo, selecting a CD. 
               Fay is on the chordless phone at the kitchen window, giving 
               milk to some stray cats.

                                     FAY
                              (INTO PHONE)
                         Of course I'm excited Ellie. The 
                         last person they interviewed on 
                         vacation was Dr Ruth.

               Siggy enters and walks upstairs. Marvin enters and heads to 
               the living room chair. Fay hangs up.

                                     FAY
                         He didn't dive.

                                     MARVIN
                         No.

                                     FAY
                         He's a little afraid of it, dear. 
                         Have patience.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's not like I'm making him jump 
                         out of an airplane. When I was growing 
                         up, I thought diving was fun.

                                     ANNA
                         I thought you were born grown up.

               Marvin stares at Anna. She puts on raucous heavy metal.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're masking hostility, Anna Marvin. 
                         Turn that down.

                                     ANNA
                         It's full of Freudian symbols, dad. 
                         It's educational.

               Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair, 
               then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding 
               Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly. 
               Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window. 
               It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin 
               looks up and sees Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         What the...?
                              (he bolts to the front 
                              door)
                         What are you doing here?

               Bob stands holding Gil (in the glass) and his bag.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry. Don't be mad. The Guttmans 
                         brought me.

               Bob turns and waves at the Guttmans who are walking into an 
               OLD TRAILER that occupies next lot.

                                     BOB
                         Thank you Mr. and Mrs. G.!

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Your welcome, Bobby, Hello, Dr. 
                         Marvin!

               The Guttmans wave. Marvin waves back.

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Burn in hell, Dr. Marvin!

               Marvin's hand falls. The Guttmans enter their trailer. Marvin 
               turns to Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         We agreed that I would call you. 
                         Your coming here is unbelievably 
                         inappropriate.

               Anna comes to the door.

                                     ANNA
                         Hi. I'm Anna.

                                     BOB
                         I saw your picture. I'm Bob.

               Fay comes to the door.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. I'm Bob.

                                     FAY
                         I'm Fay.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, Mrs. M. You're even prettier 
                         than your picture.

                                     FAY
                         Why thank you.

                                     MARVIN
                              (through his teeth)
                         Bob, I think you and I have some 
                         things to talk about.

                                     BOB
                         You do? You finally think so too?!

                                     MARVIN
                              (to Fay)
                         Would you excuse us, dear?

                                     FAY
                         Bob, may I take your fish?

               Bob hands Gil to Fay and she walks into the kitchen. Anna 
               just stands there.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna.

               Anna rolls her eyes and follows her mother.

                                     ANNA
                         Nice to meet you, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         You too.

               Marvin leads Bob away. Bob sees the puppets on the mantle.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE STUDY, SAME

               Bob and Marvin enter the downstairs study. Marvin indicates 
               for Bob to take a seat.

                                     BOB
                         Great place. No wonder the Guttmans 
                         wanted it. I really feel bad about 
                         barging in like this.

                                     MARVIN
                         Forget it. I understand.

                                     BOB
                         You do?

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course I do. Your problems don't 
                         go away just because I go on vacation. 
                         They've been with you a long time 
                         after all.

                                     BOB
                         Ever since I can remember.

                                     MARVIN
                         On the other hand, you're making 
                         strides. You got here.

                                     BOB
                         I baby stepped. I owe it to you.

               Bob smiles. Marvin stares at Bob for a long time then:

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob, take a look around you. What 
                         does everything you see have in 
                         common?

                                     BOB
                         Er... I don't know... It's all owned 
                         by you, that's obvious. Humm... 
                         Everything's from a garage sale!

               There is a long pause. Marvin stares at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Vacation, Bob. Everything you see is 
                         part of a vacation. Every year, for 
                         one month, I bring my family to this 
                         house on vacation. Nice, isn't it?

                                     BOB
                         It's wonderful. The lake. The trees. 
                         The little town.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do you know what the point of a 
                         vacation is? Do you understand the 
                         meaning of the word?

                                     BOB
                         Sure.

                                     MARVIN
                         You forget about your troubles. You 
                         give up your worries. You drink from 
                         the wellspring of relaxation that 
                         enriches your soul.
                              (pause)
                         Now I can't, at this time, give you 
                         the kind of therapeutic attention 
                         that you need to solve all your 
                         problems. Know why?

                                     BOB
                         Er, because you're on vacation?

                                     MARVIN
                         Excellent. But what I can do -- and 
                         only I can do this because you trust 
                         me don't you Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Why else would I be here?

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. What I can do is this.

               Marvin goes to a drawer and pulls out a prescription pad. He 
               writes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get on your bus and go back to New 
                         York. Every time a problem comes up, 
                         follow this prescription.

                                     BOB
                              (holds up his bag)
                         I don't need pills. I have plenty of 
                         pills.

               Marvin tears off a prescription sheet and hands it to bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's not pills. Read it.

                                     BOB
                              (taking it)
                         It says: "A vacation from my 
                         problems."

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm giving you permission to take a 
                         vacation, Bob. Not a vacation from 
                         your work. Not a vacation from your 
                         daily life. But a vacation from...

                                     BOB
                         My problems.

                                     MARVIN
                         Every time you feel a problem coming 
                         on, take that out and follow it to 
                         the letter. Doctors orders.

                                     BOB
                         Doctors orders.

               Marvin stands.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm glad you came. I'll see you in 
                         my office next month.

                                     BOB
                         That's it?

                                     MARVIN
                         You came here for relief, Bob. Read 
                         your prescription.

               Bob stands a moment, looking at his prescription.

                                     BOB
                         This is... INCREDIBLE! This is 
                         ASTOUNDING!! For the first time since 
                         Menningers I feel free! I knew coming 
                         up here was the right thing to do!

                                     MARVIN
                         It feels right because you're here 
                         and because you're leaving.

               Bob comes over and hugs Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         You've given me a great gift, doctor. 
                         The gift of life. You're a great 
                         man.

               EXT.-INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DAY

               Marvin opens the door for Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         If you have any questions, call Dr. 
                         Harmon.

                                     BOB
                         Have a great vacation!

                                     MARVIN
                         You too.

                                     BOB
                         A vacation from my problems. You bet 
                         I will!

               Bob exits. Marvin closes the door and looks up at the ceiling. 
               He takes a deep breath then turns back into the room. There 
               is a knock at the door.

                                     MARVIN
                              (AT THE DOOR)
                         Yes?

                                     BOB
                              (FROM WITHOUT)
                         It's Bob. I forgot Gil.

               Marvin opens the door.

                                     BOB
                         My fish.

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh. Right.

               Bob strides into the kitchen and takes his fish. Sigmund, 
               now in his clothes, enters from upstairs.

                                     BOB
                         You must be Sigmund.

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, this is Bob. He's just leaving.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hi.

                                     BOB
                         Hi. This is Gil. My fish.

                                     SIGGY
                         Cool. Did you get him out of the 
                         lake?

                                     BOB
                         No. He's a city fish.

                                     SIGGY
                         Cool.

                                     BOB
                         Your father is the most incredible 
                         psychiatrist in the world! You better 
                         appreciate him.

               He strides to the door then turns wistfully.

                                     BOB
                         Have a great vacation, fam.

                                     MARVIN
                         You too, Bob.

                                     SIGGY
                         Nice to meet you.

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESAUKEE, DAY

               Bob walks down the country lane. Crickets chirp.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation from my problems. Take a 
                         vacation from my problems. A baby 
                         stepping, lazy stepping vacation 
                         from my problems.

               Bob falls into a rhythm, almost a little jig as he walks.

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, MORNING

               Roosters crow in the new day.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin, Fay and Siggy stand frozen, like artist's models, 
               staring at something. Is this suddenly a Godard movie? Are 
               we now in a Becket play? Finally:

                                     MARVIN
                         It's too close to the wall.

                                     SIGGY
                         Who cares?

               Marvin moves to the couch and pulls it out from the wall 
               about three inches.

                                     MARVIN
                         I care, and you should too. Our house 
                         is going on national television 
                         tomorrow. You want your friends to 
                         think you live in a dump?

                                     SIGGY
                         My friends would respect me for it.

                                     MARVIN
                         You know, there's nothing wrong with 
                         neatness. People joke but it's 
                         actually a sign of a creative 
                         intelligence. Right, Fay?

                                     FAY
                         In isolated cases, sure.

                                     MARVIN
                         What is that supposed to mean?

                                     FAY
                         The room looks wonderful, dear.

               Fay pecks him on the cheek and walks into the kitchen. Siggy 
               follows. Ditto Anna who starts cooking pancakes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Seriously, what do you mean by that?

               He gets no answer from the rest of the family who look at 
               each other and smile.

                                     ANNA
                         You're incredibly creative, daddy.

               Marvin goes back to making minuscule adjustments: adjusting 
               diplomas, etc. At the front door is a knock.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll get it. It's probably the van 
                         with my art.

               Checking out his "set" as he goes, Marvin opens the door. 
               It's Bob.

                                     BOB
                         Good morning! I'll bet you're 
                         surprised to see me!

               MARVIN STANDS DUMFOUNDED

                                     BOB
                         When I walked out of here last night 
                         I said to myself, "Dr. Marvin's 
                         absolutely right. Take a vacation 
                         from your problems. Blow em off. 
                         Just say 'no'." So I did!

                                     MARVIN
                         But... You're back.

                                     BOB
                         No I'm not.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're not?!

                                     BOB
                         Of course not. I'm taking a vacation. 
                         This isn't an appointment, I'm 
                         dropping by. I told the Guttmans 
                         what you said and they found me a 
                         cottage nearby.

                                     MARVIN
                         No...

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, the town is packed but I guess 
                         if you know the right people... 
                         Anyway, I know we can't work but 
                         let's get the friendship thing going.

               Marvin is absolutely flabbergasted.

                                     BOB
                         I'm a little anxious about being 
                         here by myself but I don't want to 
                         barge in. I'll call. Give my best to 
                         the fam and see ya around, okay?

               Bob walks away. Marvin closes the door. He stands there for 
               a long time.

                                     FAY
                         Who was that, Leo?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody.

                                     SIGGY
                         Again?

               There is a knock on the door. Marvin opens it.

                                     BOB
                         I almost forgot, here's your 
                         newspaper. See ya.

               Marvin takes the newspaper and closes the door.

                                     ANNA
                         Wasn't that Bob?

               There is another knock on the door. It's Bob.

                                     BOB
                         You guys up for going out to 
                         breakfast?

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Eating in. I admire that.

               Marvin slams the door in Bob's face.

                                     ANNA
                         That was Bob! I thought you said he 
                         left town?

                                     MARVIN
                         I did. I said exactly that.

               Anna moves to the front door, after Bob. Marvin grabs her 
               arm and leads her to the kitchen.

                                     MARVIN
                         And I don't want you letting him in 
                         this house.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, you're hurting me!

               Anna wrenches her arm away.

                                     ANNA
                         What's your problem?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't have a problem.

               Fay walks in.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, who is that man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nobody, Fay. Nothing to get excited 
                         about. A work related problem just 
                         went away.
                              (smiles nonchalantly)
                         It's fine.

               He strolls off into the kitchen. Anna rubs her arm.

                                     ANNA
                         I've never seen him like this.

                                     FAY
                              (low)
                         If you want to know, I think your 
                         father is nervous about going on 
                         national television tomorrow. Freud 
                         himself would be anxious so let's be 
                         supportive, okay?

                                     ANNA
                         He should go punch some pillows.

                                     SIGGY
                         Or get shock treatment.

                                     FAY
                         Remember that he's under pressure.

                                     MARVIN (FROM THE KITCHEN)
                         Flap jacks!

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESALRKEE, DAY

               Bob walks down the empty country lane. Crickets chirp.

                                     BOB
                         Vacation from my problems. Take a 
                         vacation from my problems. There's 
                         nothing to fear, there's nobody here. 
                         Nothing to fear
                              (he suddenly panics)
                         THERE'S NOBODY HERE!

               He starts running and screaming.

               EXT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, MORNING

               TWO MEN from a van are bringing in the art from Marvin's 
               office. Marvin is using a weed trimmer to spruce up the shrubs 
               to within an inch or their lives. Anna, in a bathing suit, 
               sunglasses, and skimpy cover-up exits the house, gives her 
               father a good-bye peck on the cheek then gets in the family 
               station wagon.

                                     MARVIN
                         Where are you off to?

                                     ANNA
                         Sailing.

                                     MARVIN
                         With Teddy Fein?

                                     ANNA
                         No. George Stark. The boy from the 
                         plane.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's a quarter mile to the marina. 
                         Why do you need the car?

                                     ANNA
                         I'm picking everybody up.

               She starts the car and backs out.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay out of the sun! Remember what's 
                         happening to the ozone layer.

               EXT. A WOODED LANE IN WINNIPESAUKEE, DAY

               Bob is running in a panic. Anna drives by and sees him.

                                     ANNA
                         Bob!

               Anna hits the brakes and slows next to Bob. He breaks to a 
               slow trot.

                                     ANNA
                         Hi! Where you going?

                                     BOB
                         Just to... town.
                              (pause)
                         Buy some..., Kleenex.

                                     ANNA
                         Want a ride?

                                     BOB
                         I don't think your dad would like 
                         you picking me up.

                                     ANNA
                         He wouldn't like a lot of things. 
                         Hop in.

               Bob hesitates then gets in.

               INT. THE MARVIN STATION WAGON, SAME

               Anna drives. Bob puts on his seat belt.

                                     BOB
                         He seemed pretty upset this morning.

                                     ANNA
                         He's nervous about the interview.

                                     BOB
                         Interview?

                                     ANNA
                         Maria Shriver's coming tomorrow to 
                         talk about his book.

                                     BOB
                         Wow... so that's the problem! And I 
                         thought he was upset about me!

                                     ANNA
                         Well he's always uptight, even when 
                         it doesn't show.

                                     BOB
                         He is?

                                     ANNA
                         Sure. Imagine growing up with a dad 
                         who sees every stage of growing up 
                         as a Freudian passage. Did you ever 
                         have crayons?

                                     BOB
                         Sure.

                                     ANNA
                         Fat or skinny?

                                     BOB
                         Er, skinny, I think.

                                     ANNA
                              (warning tone)
                         Uh oh.

                                     BOB
                         What do you mean?

                                     ANNA
                         Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols. 
                         When I asked for skinny crayons, it 
                         was a personal assault on his manhood.

                                     BOB
                         What'd he do, buy a Porsche?

               Anna laughs.

                                     ANNA
                         I wish! He just kept psychoanalyzing 
                         everything. My dolls were alter egos. 
                         Boys who wanted to kiss me were 
                         Oedipally fixated adolescents looking 
                         to displace their mothers on their 
                         aboriginal family totems.

                                     BOB
                         Sounds like my friends to a tee.
                              (a beat)
                         You seem to be doing okay now.

                                     ANNA
                         Hardly. I analyze everything to death. 
                         Every time a guy smiles at me, I ask 
                         myself is he really smiling or is he 
                         just orally fixated? When I smile 
                         back, I wonder, am I really attracted 
                         or just smiling out of some residual 
                         Cro-Magnon instinct? If I ever 
                         actually have sex, I'm not sure I'll 
                         know the difference between an orgasm 
                         and an anxiety attack!

                                     BOB
                         I have the same problem.

                                     ANNA
                         The kinds of urges other girls act 
                         on impulsively, I analyze until either 
                         the urge goes away or --

                                     BOB
                         Or what?

                                     ANNA
                         The boy goes away.

               Long pause.

                                     BOB
                         Well. It sounds like your dad never 
                         learned to leave his work at the 
                         office.

                                     ANNA
                         Lot of good it does me!

                                     BOB
                         You'll make some man very happy 
                         someday.

               This hangs in the air. Anna looks at Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         What are you doing today?

                                     BOB
                         Buying Kleenex.

                                     ANNA
                         Wanna come sailing?

                                     BOB
                         Well, I... I, er...

                                     ANNA
                         That's okay. You don't have to.

               Bob looks at Anna. He sees her attraction to him and it makes 
               him nervous but he doesn't want to reject her. He looks down 
               shyly.

                                     BOB
                         Actually, it's not that I don't want 
                         to go. It's just that I've never 
                         been on a boat and I'm not sure I 
                         can handle it.

                                     ANNA
                         There's nothing to it. George Stark's 
                         doing the sailing.

                                     BOB
                         Just thinking about gives me hives.

               EXT. GEORGE STARK'S DAY SAILBOAT, DAY. CLOSE ON BOB

               Standing next to the mast, his hair blowing in the wind.

                                     BOB
                         You're right, this is great! I never 
                         actually thought I could do this. I 
                         never thought this could be me!

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               That Bob, wearing life preservers on his body and legs, is 
               wrapped onto the mast from chest to toe with ropes. Anna, 
               George Stark (from the airport) and a few other kids sit 
               around enjoying the sail.

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, DAY

               Marvin stands at the end of the diving board, holding Siggy 
               by his ankles out over the water. On the shore next door, 
               the Guttmans sit in lounge chairs, fishing.

                                     SIGGY
                         This is child abuse! If you drop me, 
                         I'll prosecute!

                                     MARVIN
                         I am not going to let go until you're 
                         ready, okay? Trust me and put your 
                         hands out like I showed you.

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not ready! Do you hear? I'm not 
                         ready!!

               George's sailboat heels by. From it wave Anna and some of 
               her friends -- and Bob.

                                     BOB
                              (shouting and waving)
                         Hey Doctor M, look at me! I'm sailing!

               Stunned, Marvin drops Siggy into the water. Siggy does a 
               belly flop then comes up for air, furious.

                                     SIGGY
                         Murderer! Child molester...

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy, it was an accident!

                                     THE GUTTMANS
                         Hitler!

               EXT. A PIER NEAR WINNIPESAUKEE TOWN, LATER

               Marvin walks along the shore towards the pier in time to see 
               Anna and a wobbly Bob disembark George's sailboat.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna!

               Anna sees her father. She says good-bye to George and her 
               friends then walks towards her father. Bob starts towards 
               Marvin too.

                                     BOB
                         Did you see me out there?! I'm getting 
                         better all the time.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want to see Anna alone.

               Bob stops. Marvin waits while Anna walks to him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I thought I told you to stay away 
                         from Bob Wiley.

                                     ANNA
                         No. You just said I couldn't let him 
                         in the house.

               Marvin starts walking away from the sailboating party towards 
               the town green. He puts his arm around Anna so that she has 
               to walk with him.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, where are we going?

                                     MARVIN
                         Home.

                                     ANNA
                         What about the car? I left it at the 
                         pier.

                                     MARVIN
                         Leave it. It's been a while since 
                         I've had a walk with my daughter.

               Anna looks back at her friends and Bob. She shrugs then turns 
               back to her father. From his pockets Marvin removes the Leo 
               and Anna puppets and hands her "Anna".

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, not here!

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, I know you think you're old 
                         enough to know what's best for you 
                         and I know you're at the age where 
                         you don't want to listen to your 
                         father. But as your father, who's 
                         always loved you, I'm asking you not 
                         to see Bob Wiley.

               Anna grabs the Anna puppet and puts it on, defiantly.

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         I don't understand the problem! Bob's 
                         a nice guy!

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Bob Wiley is a patient. He followed 
                         me here from New York which is 
                         bizarre. But even if it weren't 
                         bizarre, my daughter seeing a patient 
                         that I'm treating is entirely 
                         inappropriate.

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         Bob said you're not treating him 
                         here.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         He's right there!

                                     ANNA PUPPET
                         So if you're not treating him while 
                         he's here, then he's not a patient 
                         while he's here, is he? And I have 
                         the right to see him!

               She throws the puppet at Marvin then runs to her friends.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, you're acting out!

                                     ANNA
                         Bob's a perfectly nice guy! He's 
                         intense and sensitive and he listens 
                         which is more than I can say about 
                         you. Bob!

               Marvin stands a moment and watches. He is stunned.

                                     MARVIN PUPPET
                         Anna, come back!

               Anna runs to Bob and takes his arm. They start walking down 
               the shore. Marvin is dumbstruck.

               INT./EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, LATER

               Siggy lies on the deck, looking up at the sky through 
               binoculars. Fay is in the kitchen, arranging driftwood. She 
               comes to the back door of the cottage.

                                     FAY
                         Why don't you come in and talk about 
                         it?

               Siggy says nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Just because your father dropped you 
                         in the water doesn't mean you can't 
                         trust me.

                                     SIGGY
                         You sleep with him. You're his spy.

               INT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin enters, looking absolutely stunned.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, you've upset Siggy.

               Marvin stares blankly at Fay then shuffles up the stairs.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...?

               Again Marvin doesn't answer and Fay starts towards him.

                                     SIGGY
                         That's right, go to him! You always 
                         do.

               Fay stops, looks at Siggy then goes upstairs after Leo.

               EXT. THE DECK, DAY

               Siggy lies back down and peers through the binoculars. As he 
               does, a grotesque CLOSE UP OF BOB pops into Siggy's field of 
               view. He sits up with a start. Bob and Anna are standing 
               over him.

                                     BOB
                         Hey, Siggy.

                                     SIGGY
                         Oh. Hi, Bob. You scared me.

                                     BOB
                         Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on 
                         you.

               Siggy lies back down and looks through the binoculars, clearly 
               not interested in being social. Bob looks at Anna. She shakes 
               her head.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad's at it again. I can tell.
                              (to Siggy)
                         Another vacation that's not a 
                         vacation, right?

                                     SIGGY
                         What's with him and diving? Maria 
                         Shriver's not gonna watch me dive!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin is prostrate on the bed, Marvin puppet still on his 
               hand, staring at the ceiling. Fay enters. She sits down next 
               to Marvin and strokes his hair.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, Siggy is really upset.

               Marvin says nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...

               Marvin looks at his wife.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, I'm a failure.

                                     FAY
                         What?

                                     MARVIN
                         Our daughter, our only daughter, has 
                         fallen for a brilliant manipulator 
                         twice her age.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, for god's sake talk sense.

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna and Bob!

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME

               Siggy is standing on the diving board, ready for his approach. 
               Bob and Anna watch from the pier. Next door the Guttmans sit 
               watching.

                                     BOB
                         Face a fear and it goes away.

                                     SIGGY
                         Okay. I'm facing it, now what do I 
                         do?

                                     BOB
                         Hit it. Fast. While it isn't looking.

               Siggy takes a deep breath, summons up his courage, and makes 
               his approach. He springs but can't dive.

                                     SIGGY
                         My mind says "yes yes" but my body 
                         says "no no". It's hopeless.

                                     BOB
                         If I'm not hopeless, nothing's 
                         hopeless...

               Bob steps onto the board. He "baby steps" out to the end 
               where Siggy is standing.

                                     BOB
                         Let's try something I saw in a pirate 
                         movie.

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin is down the hall in the bathroom, dousing his face 
               with water. Fay stands in the bedroom.

                                     MARVIN
                         For God's sake, I'm even a failure 
                         in my own book! Can you believe it? 
                         In Chapter 2, I wrote that a healthy 
                         adolescent girl can never have a 
                         sublimated father complex and my 
                         daughter has one.

                                     FAY
                         It's a brief flirtation, honey. Anna's 
                         perfectly healthy.

                                     MARVIN
                         Then you're saying the book's wrong?

                                     FAY
                         Better that than Anna.

               Marvin washes his face some more then looks up.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, my god!

               Marvin walks into the room, water dripping off his face, 
               looking like a man who's just seen his own death.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, what? Leo, what is it?

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm going on national television 
                         tomorrow -- to promote a fraud!

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME

               Bob is standing near the end of the diving board holding 
               Siggy by the hips. Siggy is hanging over the water, hands 
               and head down, ready to enter the water diving. Anna is 
               watching. So are the Guttmans.

                                     BOB
                         Don't think about boiling oil!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not.

                                     BOB
                         Or searing acid!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm not!

                                     BOB
                         Our Father, we commit this soul to 
                         the sea.

               Bob gently releases Siggy. Siggy falls into the water, diving. 
               Anna applauds. So do the Guttmans. Siggy resurfaces and throws 
               a jubilant fist in the air.

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah!

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, SAME

               Fay holds Marvin's head in her bosom, stroking him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm doomed!

                                     FAY
                         No you're not.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll be a laughing stock!

                                     FAY
                         No you won't. You've blow this way 
                         out of proportion, Leo, and you have 
                         to get control. Now try your 
                         breathing.

                                     MARVIN
                         Okay.
                              (breathes hard)
                         I'm being ridiculous.
                              (more breaths)
                         You're right.

               He walks around breathing exaggeratedly.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's a brilliant book... Our 
                         daughter's fine... I'm great.

                                     FAY
                         That's right.

               Applause from outside can be heard in the room. Fay goes to 
               the window.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, do you remember a Carswell 
                         Fensterwald?

                                     FAY
                         My God, Leo, look at this.

                                     MARVIN
                         The name is so familiar but --

                                     FAY
                         Leo, Siggy's diving!

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

               Marvin looks out the window. He sees:

               EXT. THE MARVIN PRIVATE DOCK, SAME. MARVINS' POV

               Bob releases Siggy for another perfect dive.

               BACK TO MARVIN

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll put a stop to this!

               Marvin storms out of the bedroom.

                                     FAY
                         Leo!

               EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, SAME

               Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now, 
               getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but 
               this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges 
               down the dock, Fay right behind him.

                                     MARVIN
                         Enough. Let go of him! That's enough!

                                     FAY
                         Leo!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., watch this!

                                     SIGGY
                              (leaning over to dive)
                         Watch, dad!

                                     MARVIN
                         Stop diving this instant!

                                     ANNA
                         Dad!

               Marvin leaps onto the diving board, shaking it. Bob loses 
               his grip and Siggy falls off the board, doing a back buster. 
               Bob falls in too.

                                     SIGGY
                         Ow!
                              (daggers at Marvin)
                         You bastard!

                                     FAY
                         Leo! Look at what you're doing! Leo, 
                         look at yourself!

               Everybody looks at Marvin, standing alone on the board. He 
               realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does. 
               He looks at the Guttmans.

                                     MARVIN
                         What are you staring at? I had every 
                         right to buy this house!

                                     ANNA
                              (looking in the water)
                         Where's Bob? Where's Bob?!

               Anna and Fay dive into the water. They go under looking for 
               Bob.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DECK, AFTERNOON

               Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay, 
               Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the 
               house and talks in low tones to his family.

                                     MARVIN
                         Listen, everybody, I'm not wrong 
                         often, but when I am, I admit it. 
                         I'm sorry. I mean it. How can I make 
                         it up?

               There is a pause. Anna and Siggy and Fay look at each other.

                                     SIGGY
                         Knocking Bob in the water was awful. 
                         What if he hadn't known how to swim?

                                     MARVIN
                         But he did. I'm not saying I was 
                         right, but Bob can do a lot of things 
                         no one thought he could do.

               Anna, Fay and Siggy are silent.

                                     MARVIN
                         Look, I said I was wrong now I'd 
                         like to forget it. I'd like you all 
                         to accept my apology.

                                     ANNA
                         What about Bob?

                                     MARVIN
                         What about Bob?!

                                     ANNA
                         Don't you think you should apologize 
                         to him?

               ANGLE ON BOB

               at the outdoor shower, rinsing off his clothes. He can't 
               hear the family but he can see they're talking about him and 
               he's giving them his best hang-dog looks.

                                     MARVIN
                         I will not apologize to Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         Why not?

                                     MARVIN
                         Because I won't.

                                     FAY
                         Honey, why are you so hostile towards 
                         the poor man?

                                     MARVIN
                         Because he's a patient, Fay! Don't 
                         you get it?

                                     SIGGY
                         He's not a patient, he's a person.

                                     ANNA
                         And a nice one.

                                     FAY
                         I think we should invite him for 
                         dinner.

                                     MARVIN
                         Dinner?!

                                     FAY
                         Dinner.

                                     ANNA
                         Really?!

                                     FAY
                         The poor fellow's devastated.

               Fay heads towards Bob. Marvin turns to her. He keeps his 
               voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is 
               about to explode.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay. I 
                         want to think about my interview.

               Leo is trying not to explode. Fay hangs in the balance.

                                     ANNA
                         Do it, mom. Invite him. You'd be 
                         making family history. It'd be the 
                         first major thing you've done on 
                         your own since I've known you!

                                     FAY
                         Right is right, Leo Marvin.

               Fay heads to Bob. Marvin's mouth falls open.

                                     SIGMUND
                         Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. For the 
                         next few seconds we will be conducting 
                         a test of the emergency broadcast 
                         system:

               MARVIN SIGGY

               Fay talks to Bob. Anna heads over to him too. Marvin stands 
               speechless, ready to commit hari-kari.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE PATIO, EVENING

               Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the 
               moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along 
               the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin 
               family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking 
               the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob, 
               swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.

                                     BOB
                         Get away. Get away!

                                     SIGGY
                         Ring around the moon. Rain coming 
                         soon.

                                     BOB
                              (edgy to Siggy)
                         Gee, is that true?

                                     MARVIN
                         It's superstitious nonsense.

               Anna and Fay exit the cottage carrying trays of food.

                                     BOB
                              (to Fay and Anna)
                         That looks scrumptious.

               Anna smiles and hands the first plate of food to Bob. Marvin 
               sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at 
               Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this 
               exchange of looks.

                                     BOB
                         Did I do something?

                                     FAY
                         No, Bob. It's fine. Eat up. Leo.

               Fay looks at Marvin and shakes her head "no".

                                     BOB
                              (eating)
                         Mmmm. Mmmmm. This sure is good. Mmmm. 
                         Mmmmm. Mmmmm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Would you please stop that?

                                     BOB
                         Oh. Sorry, Leo. Would you pass the 
                         salt?

                                     MARVIN
                         And don't call me Leo.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry. You said in your office 
                         that I could call you Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         That was in my office. In my home 
                         you will call me Dr. Marvin.

               Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly 
               at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.

                                     FAY
                              (low)
                         He's nervous about the interview 
                         tomorrow. Don't take it personally.

                                     BOB
                              (to Marvin)
                         Hey, that's right, I heard about 
                         your upcoming debut. Congratulations.

               Marvin nods and eats. Bob throws salt over his shoulder then 
               salts his food.

                                     BOB
                         Your book's going to do a lot of 
                         people a lot of good, Le-- Dr. Marvin. 
                         I'm walking proof of that.

               Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad 
               on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad?

                                     FAY
                         Sweetheart?

               Marvin turns red and points to his throat. He falls to the 
               deck on his side. Bob stands.

                                     BOB
                         Don't panic! I know what to do!

               Bob hurries to Marvin, lies beside him, and administers the 
               Heimlick maneuver. On the second try, Marvin's throat clears. 
               Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, you okay?

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy?!

                                     FAY
                         Honey?!

               Marvin says something. Fay leans over him to hear.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, are you okay?

                                     MARVIN
                         I said..., get him off me!

               Bob lets go of Marvin. Marvin coughs and crawls away.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob, you saved him!

                                     ANNA
                         Incredible! Wonderful!

                                     FAY
                         Thank you!

               Fay helps Marvin gets to his feet. Suddenly, there is a flash 
               of lightning. Bob jumps. Rain begins to fall. Marvin looks 
               up.

                                     SIGGY
                         Told you so.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, NIGHT

               The rain outside is coming down in buckets. Marvin is in the 
               living room, re-straightening the furniture and art ever so 
               meticulously. He adjusts a diploma over the mantle. Anna, 
               Fay, Siggy and Bob are in the kitchen, doing the dishes.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         "I'm singing in the rain, Just singing 
                         in the rain, What a glorious feeling,

               Bob throws his pack of Kleenex into the trash.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         I'm happy again!

               Bob retrieves the pack of Kleenex from the trash.

                                     BOB
                              (SINGING)
                         "I walk though the kitchen With a 
                         bowl full of chicken
                              (puts the chicken in 
                              the fridge)
                         I'm singing, I'm singing In the rain."

               Anna and Fay and Siggy start a dance. Marvin enters.

                                     MARVIN
                         Look, tomorrow morning is very 
                         important and I'd like to call it a 
                         night. I don't want to be rude but I 
                         think it's time for Bob to sing his 
                         way home.

                                     FAY
                              (re: the rain)
                         Honey, you don't expect Bob to walk 
                         back in this do you?

                                     MARVIN
                         Did I say that? I'll drive him.

                                     ANNA
                         The car's still in town, daddy.

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

                                     ANNA
                         You said to leave it, remember? We 
                         walked home.

               Marvin seethes then looks darkly at Anna.

                                     MARVIN
                         The rain's bound to let up. Bob can 
                         go then.

                                     SIGGY
                         What if it starts up again while 
                         Bob's on the way?

                                     MARVIN
                              (nastily)
                         He can borrow my slicker.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, LATE NIGHT

               Marvin stands staring out the window like he'd like to murder 
               the rain that is still coming down in torrents. Bob is on 
               the couch, sitting alone, wearing Marvin's yellow slicker, 
               looking unwanted. Anna, Siggy and Fay sit quietly, watching 
               Marvin. Bob looks at Fay and shrugs like he's sorry. Fay 
               puts a sympathetic hand on Bob's.

                                     FAY
                         Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         Shsh.

                                     FAY
                         Leo...

                                     MARVIN
                         Quiet. It's letting up.

               There is a crash of thunder that shakes the rafters. Marvin 
               reaches out and slowly scratches the window, creating a tiny 
               squeaking sound. Fay walks to him.

                                     FAY
                              (low)
                         Leo, we can't make the poor fellow 
                         sit here all night. Let's let him 
                         stay over.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay over? Honey, Maria Shriver's 
                         coming in the morning. Maria Shriver! 
                         You want some guy sleeping on our 
                         couch when Maria Shriver gets here?

               He almost laughs at the idea.

                                     FAY
                         There's an extra bed in Siggy's room. 
                         Bob, would you like to spend the 
                         night?

                                     BOB
                         Well I... Do you have a dacron pillow?

                                     SIGGY
                         That's a great idea!

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay!

                                     BOB
                         Are you sure I'm not imposing?

                                     MARVIN
                         Of course you are -- !

                                     FAY
                         -- aren't. Anna, find an extra set 
                         of sheets. Siggy, get one of your 
                         father's robes for Bob.

               Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then exits the room with Anna. 
               Marvin claws the window making a bone chilling squeak.

               INT. SIGGY'S ROOM, NIGHT

               Siggy's room has twin beds arranged head to head against the 
               corner. Bob, wearing one of Marvin's robes, enters. Siggy is 
               hanging up his clothes.

                                     SIGGY
                         Did you find a toothbrush?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.
                              (belches and hits his 
                              chest)
                         Excuse me.

                                     SIGGY
                         You care which bed?

                                     BOB
                         I'd prefer facing southeast.

               INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, SAME

               Marvin enters in his pj's. Fay is preparing for bed.

                                     MARVIN
                         Have you seen my new toothbrush?

                                     FAY
                         It should be in the bathroom.

                                     MARVIN
                         Well it should be but it's not!

               Fay shoots Marvin a dirty look then heads towards the

                         Just because you're nervous about 
                         tomorrow, Leo Marvin, doesn't give 
                         you the right to get snippy. If you 
                         can't handle the pressure, postpone 
                         the interview.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay, it's not the interview -- I 
                         mean I am nervous about it -- but 
                         that's not what's bugging me. It's... 
                         him.

                                     FAY
                         Him who? Bob?

                                     MARVIN
                         No, Siggy. Yes, Bob! Who else?

                                     FAY
                         Leo, quiet. He'll hear you.

                                     MARVIN
                         Why shouldn't he hear me? Don't you 
                         get it, he's a sick person. A 
                         multiphobic mess! He faked suicide...

                                     FAY
                         Isn't that a cry for help?

                                     MARVIN
                         ...Followed me up here from New York, 
                         wormed his way into my house. For 
                         all I know, he's a mass murderer!

                         Oh come on, Leo, he's a sweet guy. 
                         Perfectly harmless.

                                     MARVIN
                         You don't know that! Everything he's 
                         done violates the patient-doctor 
                         relationship. Now he's in there with 
                         our son!

               INT. THE SIGGY'S BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Bob and Siggy lie in Siggy's twin beds. Outside, lightning 
               flashes. Bob chews his nails.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     SIGGY
                         How come you go to dad? Are you really 
                         sick or just maladjusted?

                                     BOB
                         Sick. You ever had a bee buzz your 
                         face that wouldn't go away?

                                     SIGGY
                         Sure. Once or twice.

                                     BOB
                         When I was twelve, I had one buzz me 
                         for three weeks.

               Lightning strikes again. Bob bites his nails. He stands and 
               paces a bit. He notices some books in Siggy's bookcase.

                                     BOB
                         Whoa. You got some heavy stuff here. 
                         Denial of Death, Fear and Trembling, 
                         Sickness Unto Death.

                                     SIGGY
                         Those are dad's.

                                     BOB
                         He lets you read this stuff?

                                     SIGGY
                         He hid them but I found them.

               Bob looks in one, shudders, then puts it back on the shelf.

                                     SIGGY
                         Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah?

                                     SIGGY
                         Are you afraid of death?

                                     BOB
                         Sure. Are you kidding?

                                     SIGGY
                         What do you do about it? I mean, how 
                         do you cope?

                                     BOB
                         Well... The way I figure it, if it 
                         weren't called "death", it wouldn't 
                         be so bad. I mean what if it were 
                         called "dink"?

                                     SIGGY
                         Dink?

                                     BOB
                         Then it would be fine. We'd say 
                         "Grandma dinked." "The garbage man 
                         dinked."

                                     SIGGY
                         My turtle just dinked.

                                     BOB
                         Exactly. Then we wouldn't worry 
                         anymore.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hey, you're right!

                                     BOB
                         'Course we'd still have to worry 
                         about Barrett's Esophagus and Black 
                         Water Fever and Tourette's Syndrome.

                                     SIGGY
                         What's Tourette's syndrome?

               INT. FAY AND MARVIN'S BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Fay and Leo lie near sleep. Suddenly, from the other room, 
               comes a loud barrage of profanity.

                                     SIGGY (O.S.)
                         FART BRAIN!

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         BOOGER HEAD!

                                     SIGGY (O.S.)
                         DONKEY DICK!

               Fay and Marvin spring out of bed.

               INT. SIGGY'S ROOM, NIGHT

               Bob and Siggy are jumping up and down on their beds, spouting 
               profanity at each other. Marvin and Fay rush in.

                                     MARVIN
                         What is going on in here?!

               Bob and Siggy jump under the covers.

                                     SIGGY
                         Sorry, Dad.

                                     BOB
                         Sorry.

                                     MARVIN
                         I asked you a question!

                                     SIGGY
                         Tourette's Dad. You know, Dad.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, Dad... Leo... Dr. Marvin.

               Marvin glares at Bob. Fay nudges Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         It's kids being kids, Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't want to hear another peep 
                         out of this room. I'm trying to get 
                         some sleep around here! Tomorrow is 
                         the most important day of my career! 
                         CBS is coming here. Maria Shriver is 
                         coming here. Millions will be 
                         watching. And buying!

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm sorry, Dad. We'll stop.

                                     BOB
                         We got carried away. We won't do it 
                         again.

               Marvin stares at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want you out by six thirty. 
                         Understand. Maria Shriver comes at 
                         seven, I want you out by six thirty.

                                     BOB
                         Sure. Would you like something for 
                         sleep?

                                     MARVIN
                         What?

                                     BOB
                         I've got Valium if you need it.

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't need Valium.

                                     BOB
                         Halcyon? Seconal?

                                     MARVIN
                         I need peace and quiet!

                                     BOB
                         I'll be quiet.

                                     SIGGY
                         And I'll be peace.

               Bob nudges Siggy and they try to contain their laughter. 
               Marvin glares at them then storms out. Fay comes up and tucks 
               them into their beds.

                                     BOB
                         It's my fault, Mrs. M., we should 
                         have been quieter.

                                     FAY
                         We just have to get him through Maria 
                         Shriver. Sleep tight. Don't let the 
                         bed bugs bite.

                                     BOB
                         Bed bugs!

                                     FAY
                         It's just an expression.

                                     BOB
                         Oh right. 'Night.

               She turns out the light and pulls the door closed.

                                     BOB
                         Mrs. M!

               Fay opens the door.

                                     BOB
                         Would you mind leaving it cracked?

               Fay smiles and leaves the door cracked.

               EXT. LONG SHOT OF LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, EARLY MORNING

               A clearing storm, right after dawn. Three vans from "CBS 
               Morning" wind along the lake towards town.

               EXT. THE SECOND STORY OF THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Through the window we see Siggy and Bob sound asleep in their 
               beds. DOLLY ACROSS the clapboards to Leo and Fay's room where 
               Fay lies sound asleep and Marvin lies looking at his watch. 
               It lets out a series of beeps and he stands and exits. DOLLY 
               back to Siggy's room where Marvin knocks, loudly.

                                     MARVIN
                         Six o'clock, rise and shine!

               Siggy sits up. Bob doesn't stir. Marvin enters, watch beeping, 
               and walks to Bob. He puts the watch next to Bob's ear.

                                     MARVIN
                         Rise and shine. Six o'clock. Rise 
                         and shine, rise and shine.

               Bob doesn't move. Fay and Anna enter in robes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob... Bob!

               He shakes Bob's bed.

                                     MARVIN
                         BOB!

               Bob sleeps through incredible shaking and yelling from a 
               desperate Marvin then suddenly sits up with a start.

                                     BOB
                         AHHHH!

               Everybody leaps back.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSEHOLD, EARLY MORNING

               Marvin is in the living room, dressed in his stiffest casuals 
               from L.L. Bean, nervously adjusting his "set". Fay is in the 
               kitchen, preparing food. Momentarily, Bob comes bounding 
               down the stairs.

                                     BOB
                              (more and more rapidly)
                         Baby stepping down the stairs. Baby 
                         stepping down the stairs!

               He turns and sees Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Hello! Is this a beautiful day or 
                         what?

               Marvin walks to Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                              (gritted teeth)
                         Leave.

                                     BOB
                         I had the most incredible dream last 
                         night, I --

                                     MARVIN
                         Go.

                                     BOB
                         Is this something you want me to 
                         work out on my own?

                                     MARVIN
                         Now!

                                     BOB
                         Well. You've been right about 
                         everything so far. God, therapy is a 
                         fascinating process. 'Bye Mrs. M. 
                         Thank you for everything. 'Bye Anna. 
                         See you later.

                         'Bye Bob. See you later today, maybe.

                         Don't be a stranger.

                                     BOB
                         You know me. I won't.
                              (towards the upstairs)
                         So long, ass wipe of the universe!

                              (coming to the railing 
                              upstairs)
                         'Bye dog pissing barf brain!

                                     MARVIN
                         Siggy! Bob!

               Bob exits out the front door.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Later, fart smelling douche bag!
                              (beat)
                         Maria Shriver's here.

               Marvin turns red in the face. He walks to the door.

               EXT. INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DOORWAY, SAME

               MARIA SHRIVER and her entourage - PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, video 
               crew, etc. -- approach the door.

                                     MARIA SHRIVER
                         Dr. Marvin, Maria Shriver.

                                     MARVIN
                              (swallows nervously)
                         Hello.

                                     MARIA
                         I hope we're not too early. May we 
                         come in?

               Marvin steps aside. The crew enters with equipment.

                                     MARVIN
                         Sure. I thought by the fireplace...

                                     CREW MEMBER
                         It's a fireplace shot, fellows.

               INT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Bob walks to the side screen door, pushes his nose to it and 
               watches. Marvin sees this and motions Bob away with his hand. 
               Bob waves back. Two men approach Marvin.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I'm the Director, Howie Katrell. 
                         This is Lenny Burns, our Producer.

               Marvin shakes their hands. Maria admires the house.

                                     MARIA
                         This is even nicer than the pictures.

                                     MARVIN
                         Thank you.

                                     MARIA
                         Is this your family?

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh, sorry. This is my wife, er, Fay. 
                         My daughter Anna, and my son...

               Marvin is so nervous, he's forgotten Siggy's name.

                                     SIGGY
                         I'm Siggy, dad. How's Arnold? Can 
                         you get me his autograph?

                                     MARVIN
                         Sigmund...

                                     MARIA
                         I think I can swing it.

                                     SIGGY
                         Really? Wow!

               Maria looks at Bob who is still standing in the screen door.

                                     MARIA
                         Hi. I'm Maria.

                                     BOB
                         I'm Bob.

               He opens the screen door and shakes her hand. This done, 
               Marvin closes the screen door on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob's a patient. He was just --

                                     MARIA
                         Wow. A Baby Stepper in action. Neat 
                         idea. Howie, Dr. Marvin's gonna have 
                         a patient on with him.

                                     HOWIE
                         Fine. Let's can the fireplace shot 
                         and --

                                     MARVIN
                         Now wait just a minute!

                                     HOWIE
                         That's okay. We can still use the 
                         fireplace. Phil, what say we set up 
                         over there and...

               Bob opens the screen door and walks back in. Marvin sees 
               this and can't believe it.

                                     MARVIN
                         Ms. Shriver, --

                                     MARIA
                         You know the more I think about this, 
                         Doctor, the more I love it. I mean 
                         who better to testify to the 
                         effectiveness of your book than one 
                         of your patients. I think it's a two 
                         parter, Lenny.

                                     LENNY
                         I do to. Great idea, Dr. Marvin. 
                         Terrific.

               He slaps a disbelieving Marvin on the back.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, MORNING

               The room is bright lit for TV and the crew is making last 
               minute adjustments. Marvin and Bob sit on the couch, both 
               nervous wrecks, Bob clutching his copy of Baby Steps and an 
               air sickness bag, Marvin clutching a copy of his book. 
               Marvin's diplomas and art are displayed prominently on the 
               "set". The proud family looks on. Fay leans in with a lint 
               roller, rolls Marvin's shirt, kisses him, and backs out.

                                     HOWIE
                         Live feed in ten.

                                     FAY
                         Knock em dead, honey.

                                     LENNY
                         Howie, I don't like that there.

               A crew person rushes up and takes down Marvin's diploma.

                                     HOWIE
                         Five -- four -- three --

                                     BOB
                         Can I use the bathroom?

               Howie points at Maria.

                                     MARIA
                              (TO TV CAMERA)
                         Good Morning. We're live in the 
                         beautiful Lake Winnipesaukee summer 
                         home of Dr. Leo M. Marvin, author of 
                         the newest sensation in therapy, 
                         Baby Steps. Also with us is Dr. 
                         Marvin's patient, Bob Wiley. Good 
                         morning, Dr. Marvin. Bob.

                                     BOB AND MARVIN
                              (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
                         Good morning.

               Marvin shoots Bob a dirty look. Bob smiles innocently. 
               Suddenly Bob takes out his air sickness bag and holds it out 
               as if to throw up in it. After a long beat, Bob puts it back.

                                     BOB
                         False alarm. Sorry.

               Bob smiles. Marvin turns beet red.

                                     MARIA
                         Dr. Marvin, it takes a remarkable 
                         amount of confidence in your methods 
                         to bring on a patient with you. What 
                         in particular about Bob's prior 
                         condition would you like to share 
                         with us?

               Marvin looks at Bob. A tiny, sadistic smile comes across his 
               face. There are a million things he'd like to say about Bob -- 
               to humiliate him, punish him, discredit him, ridicule him, 
               vilify him, pillory him -- on national TV.

                                     MARVIN
                         Nothing.

                                     MARIA
                         Nothing? Nothing in particular you 
                         think we should know?

                                     MARVIN
                         No.

                                     MARIA
                         Hum... Well...
                              (pause)
                         Let me try you, Bob.

               She smiles at Bob. Bob takes out his air sickness bag again. 
               He holds it for a long time then puts it away. He smiles.

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

                                     MARIA
                         Have you been a patient of Dr. 
                         Marvin's for a long time?

                                     BOB
                         Long time? I wouldn't call it a long 
                         time.
                              (looking at Marvin)
                         What? Three or four days?

                                     MARIA
                         Days?!

               INT. A DINGY ROOM IN A DOWNTOWN URBAN SPRAWL, SAME

               Carswell Fensterwald sits watching Marvin and Bob on TV. 
               Marvin is a bumbling wreck, trying to save this one.

                                     MARVIN
                              (ON TV)
                         Well... you see... I was..., he was... 
                         I was..., following his case 
                         through..., another psychiatrist... 
                         He thought I was, er, the perfect 
                         doctor for the case. Because of my 
                         book.

                                     MARIA
                              (ON TV)
                         Ah.

                                     BOB
                         Why you sly dogs, he was right! I 
                         want to say that if more wisdom, or 
                         more empathy, or more pure 
                         intelligence exists than exits in 
                         this man, I want to know about it. 
                         Do you know that he actually had me 
                         sleep here last night? In his jamies, 
                         using his toothbrush!

                                     MARIA
                              (ON TV)
                         That's a very unusual technique.

               Fensterwald pounds his chair and howls with glee.

               BACK TO MARVIN'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

                                     MARVIN
                         Well --

                                     BOB
                         I'll say and I've been to them all. 
                         Doctors who made you beat pillows.

               He demonstrates by beating a couch pillow.

                                     BOB
                         Doctors who make you scream.

               Bob suddenly screams. Marvin jumps.

                                     BOB
                         But this doctor has something simple. 
                         Baby Steps.

               Bob holds up Baby Steps then stands and walks back and forth 
               in front of Marvin. He holds the book so that it can be seen 
               by the TV camera.

                                     BOB
                         Baby step across the room. Baby step 
                         across the room...

               He leans and looks into the TV camera.

                                     BOB
                         Are you getting the book?

               Bob plops back on the couch.

                                     BOB
                         Let me tell you what I used to be 
                         like before I met Dr M.

               Bob puts his arm around Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Eleven years ago I was not the man 
                         you see today. Eleven years ago...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, MORNING

               The CBS vans are loading up. Maria, Lenny and Howie stand at 
               the door saying good-by. Marvin hovers in the background, in 
               shock.

                                     MARIA
                         Bob, that stuff about yourself was 
                         refreshingly honest. Could we talk 
                         to you again in a few months to update 
                         your progress?

                                     BOB
                         Sure. As long as my doctor gives 
                         permission.

               Marvin tries to force a smile but can't. A CBS staff 
               photographer comes over, places Bob and Maria in his frame 
               and snaps a picture. The CBS people head off.

                                     MARIA
                         Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. 
                         Marvin.

                                     FAY
                         Anytime!

               Maria and CBS leave.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               The family and Bob move back into the house. Looking like a 
               zombie, Leo closes the door. He stands still for a long 
               moment.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm... ruined!

                                     FAY
                         Ruined?

                                     MARVIN
                         My career... Everything I've worked 
                         for..., over!

               Marvin ambles across the room like a cripple. The family 
               watches in shock.

                                     ANNA
                         But daddy...

               Suddenly Marvin turns on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get out.

                                     BOB
                         Is it something, I said?

               Marvin moves at Bob, backing him towards the front door.

                                     MARVIN
                         GET OUT!!

               Seeing Marvin's rage, Bob backs out and Marvin closes the 
               door. After a moment there's a knock. Marvin opens it.

                                     BOB
                         Is this aversion therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         GO AWAY NOW!

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               Marvin slams the door again. The family is stunned.

                                     FAY
                         My god, Leo, what's got into you?

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, you're over reacting. What about 
                         Bob?

               EXT. THE CRIS CRAFT BOAT, DAY

               The doctors and their wives sit rapt, listening to Doctor 3.

                                     WIFE
                         Yeah, what about Bob?

                                     ANOTHER DOCTOR
                         What about Bob?

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, DAY

                                     MARVIN
                         WHAT ABOUT BOB?!

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad...

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, look at your behavior. What 
                         are you doing?

                                     MARVIN
                         What am I doing? What am I doing?!

               He strides across the room. He finds his electronic organizer, 
               opens it, and pushes buttons.

                                     MARVIN
                         Wednesday... Afternoon...

               He holds out the organizer for family to see the readout.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm going sailing!

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. THE COUNTRY ROAD, DAY

               Bob walks down the road, upset, talking to himself.

                                     BOB
                         The fam is hurt. I've hurt them. I 
                         didn't mean to. Certainly they realize 
                         that. I've hurt the fam. Hurt the 
                         fam. I've hurt the fam.

               The Marvin station wagon, Marvin driving, passes. Bob sees 
               Fay, Siggy, and Anna turn and wave.

                                     BOB
                         Hi fam!
                              (pause)
                         Bye fam!

               The car speeds on.

                                     BOB
                         I hurt the fam.

               EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE PIER, DAY

               Marvin's family climbs aboard a small sailboat. Marvin pulls 
               a line onto the deck, then the boat glides out into the lake.

               EXT. WINNIPESAUKEE TOWN, FILLED WITH VACATIONERS, SAME

               Bob wanders, looking lost, mumbling.

                                     BOB
                         I could apologize. But then I'd have 
                         to go back and I'm not sure they 
                         want me. I hurt the fam. That much I 
                         know. Hurt the fam.

                                     VENDOR (O.S.)
                         Hot dog, bub?

               Bob looks idly up. A VENDOR with a cart is talking to Bob.

                                     BOB
                              (distracted)
                         Sure.

               The VENDOR hands Bob a hot dog. Bob hands him money then 
               wanders off.

               NEW ANGLE, A BUSY GREEN BESIDE THE PIER, DAY

               Families of tourists stroll. Bob stands staring dejectedly 
               out at the lake. Unthinkingly, he takes a bite of the hot 
               dog then turns.

                                     BOB
                         This has to be some kind of test. I 
                         know I hurt them but they have to 
                         know I didn't mean it. If it's a 
                         test... I ate a hot dog.

               Bob stares at the hot dog like it just spoke Greek.

                                     BOB
                         I ATE A HOT DOG!

               The tourists turn and stare.

               EXT. LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE, SAME

               Marvin stands at the helm, sailing the small sailboat across 
               lake. The breeze blows Marvin's hair, making him look wild. 
               Anna suns. Siggy casts a fishing line. Fay stares into 
               nowhere.

                                     MARVIN
                         I mean it's summer time right, what 
                         could their audience be, five million? 
                         Most of them hardly pay attention 
                         anyway, right? The point is, the 
                         book got on. It couldn't hurt sales, 
                         that much could it?

                                     FAY
                         Of course not.

                                     MARVIN
                         I mean... It's a disaster, Fay!

                                     FAY
                         Honey...

                                     ANNA
                         Hey, look. Isn't that Bob?

               Off the bow, a small motorboat is approaching.

               ANGLE ON THE MOTORBOAT, SAME

               Bob is steering a small motorboat towards the sailboat. He 
               holds half of his hot dog out like a trophy.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M! Dr. M., I've had a 
                         breakthrough! I ate a hot dog! I'm 
                         driving a boat! Thanks to you!

               ANGLE IN THE SAILBOAT

                                     ANNA
                         It is Bob! It's Bob!

                                     MARVIN
                         Oh no.

                                     SIGGY
                         Hey, Bob!

               Anna and Siggy wave. Marvin's eyes narrow. Bob keeps shouting 
               as he motors closer.

                                     BOB
                         I'm really making progress now! I 
                         feel like a whole new world is opening 
                         up!

               He keeps getting closer.

                                     BOB
                         My childhood memories are rushing 
                         over me like a flood!

               Marvin turns the rudder and comes about.

                                     MARVIN
                         Coming about!

               He turns the sailboat and heads the opposite direction from 
               Bob.

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, what are you doing?

                                     MARVIN
                              (at Bob's boat)
                         Go away!

                                     BOB
                         What?

                                     ANNA
                         Daddy, he's trying to talk to you.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad...

               Marvin keeps sailing away. But Bob's boat is faster and it's 
               gaining. Marvin sees this, jerks the rudder again, and turns 
               ninety degrees. He stands and shouts at Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         Go away, do you hear me!!

                                     FAY
                         Leo, the boom!

               The boom hits Marvin square in the chest, and knocks him 
               overboard.

                                     ANNA, FAY, SIGGY
                         Daddy! Leo! Dad!

               EXT. THE WATER, LAKE LEVEL, SAME

               Marvin bobs in the water. The pilotless sailboat heels away. 
               Bob dives in, swims to Marvin, and grabs him by the chin in 
               a traditional life-saver hold. As Siggy gains control of the 
               sailboat, Bob begins doing the side stroke towards the distant 
               shore with Marvin in tow.

                                     BOB
                         I never had a father, really. Dad 
                         left one morning and never came back. 
                         My earliest memory is mom with a 
                         suitcase. Do you think that's 
                         significant?

               Marvin is a prisoner in tow. He drags himself under water. 
               Bob pulls him up and keeps swimming.

                                     BOB
                         I'd like to do some free association 
                         about my infancy: A beachball. A 
                         dog. A frog. A log. Poodle, noodle, 
                         doodle...

               As Bob swims Marvin towards the shore, going on and on with 
               this inane free association...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, AFTERNOON

               Marvin, dry and dressed now, exits the house and gets in the 
               station wagon. He honks. Momentarily Bob runs out.

                                     BOB
                              (at the house)
                         Will do!

               Bob gets in the car. Affectless, Marvin stares at him.

                                     BOB
                         Wherever we're going, Fay wants us 
                         home by seven.

                                     MARVIN
                         No problem.

               Marvin accelerates away, rudely.

               EXT./INT. THE MARVIN STATION WAGON, DAY

               Rain is falling. The wipers swish. Marvin drives through 
               pastoral New Hampshire countryside focused, perhaps too 
               intently, on the road. Bob sits beside him.

                                     BOB
                         It's a combustible relationship, 
                         isn't it? Is it just you and me or 
                         is it you and everybody?
                              (pause)
                         So what's the big surprise?

                                     MARVIN
                         Intensive psychotherapy.

                                     BOB
                         Really?!

                                     MARVIN
                         Isn't that what you came here for?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah! But what brought this on now?

                                     MARVIN
                         You're ready.

                                     BOB
                         Wow. This is exciting.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, DAY

               The rain has let up. Marvin pulls up to a gated estate 
               sporting expansive grounds and a hotel sized main building. 
               Marvin stops at a guard gate.

                                     MARVIN
                         Leo Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky.

               The GATE GUARD checks a list. He waves Marvin through. GATE 
               GUARD Main building doctor. They're expecting you.

                                     BOB
                         Where are we?

                                     MARVIN
                         Therapy land, Bob. A twentieth century 
                         theme park of the mind.

               They drive.

                                     MARVIN
                         The lines look short today.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, SAME

               Marvin gets out and so does Bob. A man Leo's age, DR. TOMSKY, 
               approaches.

                                     DR. TOMSKY
                         Hello, Leo. Long time no see! Is 
                         this our friend?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob Wiley, this is your new pal, Dr. 
                         Tomsky.

                                     BOB
                         New pal? What's wrong with my old 
                         pal?

               Tomsky makes a motion of his head. Two big attendants move 
               to either side of Bob.

                                     BIG ATTENDANT 1
                         Let us show you to your room.

               They lead Bob off.

                                     BOB
                         Hey! Don't touch me! I have seizures! 
                         Dr. M! Dr. M!!

               They take Bob into a building. Marvin turns to Tomsky.

                                     MARVIN
                         I really appreciate your helping me 
                         out on this, Kenneth.

               Tomsky holds out a form for Marvin to sign. He does.

                                     TOMSKY
                         I can only hold him for twenty four 
                         hours, Leo. Without staff 
                         corroboration.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm not worried in the least, Kenneth. 
                         I'm sure your entire staff will 
                         corroborate. With intensive treatment 
                         he should be out in about -- fifty 
                         years.

               Marvin hands the clipboard back to Tomsky. They shake.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DRIVEWAY, LATE AFTERNOON

               The Marvin station wagon pulls into the driveway, radio is 
               blasting, playing a tape of Neil Diamond. Marvin exits it, 
               dancing as he sings along.

                                     MARVIN AND TAPE
                         "I'll be what I am, solitary man. 
                         SOLITARY MAN!"

               INT. THE MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin enters singing. Siggy and Anna see him.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad, you okay?

                                     MARVIN
                              (to "Oklahoma")
                         "Okay, Anna Mae, Leo Marvin's okay 
                         Leo Marvin, he's okay!"

                                     SIGGY
                         Where's Bob?

                                     ANNA
                         Yeah, dad, where's Bob?

                                     MARVIN
                         Can't a man enjoy himself on vacation?

                                     ANNA
                         Dad -- ?

                                     MARVIN
                         Bob sends his regrets but he had to 
                         take a trip.

                                     ANNA
                         What kind of trip? I thought you 
                         were working with him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I was.

                                     ANNA
                         Then why'd he go on a trip?

                                     MARVIN
                         Why does a man climb a mountain, 
                         Anna? Because it's there.

               Marvin turns up the music and dances. Anna and Siggy stand 
               stunned.

                                     ANNA
                         He didn't even say good-bye?

                                     SIGGY
                         He just left?

                                     ANNA
                         It's not like Bob not to say good-
                         bye.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's why he left, you see. He just 
                         wasn't himself.
                              (pause)
                         He'll write.

                                     ANNA
                         Dad, if you did something to Bob...

                                     MARVIN
                         Anna, what do you take me for?
                              (pause)
                         Everything's fine.

               Marvin, looking perfectly content, turns off the music, goes 
               to his chair, picks up Freud's Understanding Dreams, the 
               book he's been trying to read since he arrived here. Siggy 
               and Anna stare at him suspiciously. Fay enters carrying the 
               cordless phone.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, a Dr. Tomsky says it's urgent.

               Marvin takes the phone and walks into the kitchen. Anna and 
               Siggy look even more suspicious. Momentarily Leo strides out 
               of the kitchen and walks out the front door.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, where are you going?

                                     MARVIN
                         Out.

                                     FAY
                         Just like that?
                              (pause)
                         Be home by seven, okay?

               Marvin doesn't answer because he's gone.

                                     ANNA
                         Something's rotten in Winnipesaukee.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, LATE AFTERNOON

               Marvin's car screeches up. Marvin hurries out.

               INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, SAME

               Bob sits around a table with Tomsky and several members of 
               the STAFF who are laughing.

                                     BOB
                         Wait, I've another one. Who knows 
                         the difference between Freud and 
                         Moses?

               He sees blank, expectant faces, waiting for a punchline.

                                     BOB
                         Well if you don't know, I'm going to 
                         another clinic!

               All laugh. Tomsky sees Marvin enter and stands.

                                     TOMSKY
                         Excuse me.

                                     BOB
                         So a psychiatrist and a psychologist 
                         go into a bar and order Bloody 
                         Marys...

               INT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME HALLWAY, SAME

               Tomsky joins Marvin in the hall. In the other room we see 
               Bob continuing to joke with the staff.

                                     MARVIN
                         Kenneth, you have been duped by a 
                         textbook narcissist. A brilliant 
                         neuropath!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Brilliant enough to dupe my entire 
                         staff? I doubt that.

               Tomsky stuffs a paper into Marvin's shirt pocket.

                                     TOMSKY
                         I'm giving you back his admitting 
                         forms, Leo, to save you any 
                         embarrassment.

                                     MARVIN
                         Embarrassment?!

                                     TOMSKY
                         It's perfectly natural for a patient 
                         to bond with his analyst. It's a 
                         normal part of therapy. If you want 
                         to be rid of him, simply take him 
                         back where you got him and go home.

                                     MARVIN
                         That's easy for you to say! He's 
                         human crazy glue! If it were that 
                         simple do you think I'd be here?

                                     TOMSKY
                         You should have never let him sleep 
                         in your pajamas, Leo. His problems 
                         don't go away just because you want 
                         them too.

                                     MARVIN
                         Whose side are you on?!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Relax, Leo.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm relaxed!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Take a vacation.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm on vacation!!

                                     TOMSKY
                         Are you sure? Maybe you should check 
                         in here for a few days and get a 
                         handle on things?

               Marvin looks at Tomsky, amazed at the implication of this 
               statement.

               EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE OF NEW ENGLAND, DAY

               Marvin drives. Bob rides. Marvin looks ready to explode.

                                     BOB
                         Intensive psychotherapy? -- boy, you 
                         weren't kidding, were you? I mean 
                         even Dr. T. didn't think I needed 
                         that.
                              (pause)
                         Look I have an idea -- how are your 
                         afternoons? I mean since we're here 
                         together with nothing else to do, 
                         what say we work from two to four, 
                         something like that?

               EXT. THE COUNTRY ROAD, SAME

               The Marvinmobile screeches to a halt and Marvin jumps out. 
               He rushes around the car and opens Bob's door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get out! Get out of my car, get out 
                         of my life, don't ever come back!

               Marvin drags Bob out of the car and slams the door.

                                     BOB
                         Are you saying you'd prefer mornings?

               Marvin gets back in and floors it. He speeds off.

                                     BOB
                         What is this, isolation therapy?

               Bob stands alone on the road.

                                     BOB
                         You're the doctor.

               Birds chirp and crickets crick. A pick-up truck passes and 
               Bob sticks out his thumb. The pick-up stops.

               INT. MARVIN'S CAR, SAME

               Marvin is about to bust a vessel. Telephone poles shoot by 
               like pickets on a fence. Behind him a siren wails. In his 
               rear-view mirror, Marvin sees a motorcycle cop approaching.

                                     MARVIN
                         No! You won't catch me!! NO!

               EXT. THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, ANOTHER SPOT, LATER

               The motorcycle cop is writing a steaming Leo Marvin a ticket. 
               A passing pick-up slows and Bob leans out the passenger 
               window.

                                     BOB
                         Need any help?

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Remember: be home by seven.

               The pick-up drives on. The motorcycle cop hands Marvin a 
               ticket. Marvin gets back into his car, throws it in gear, 
               and the car jerks backwards into the guardrail.

                                     MARVIN
                         Shit!

               Marvin throws it into forward. The car, fender dented, tears 
               away.

               EXT. THE PORCH OF A COUNTRY HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON

               Sitting on the porch of his house, an OLD MAN watches as 
               Marvin's car slows to a stop out in the road. The tire under 
               the dented fender is torn to ribbons by the metal and the 
               car is now riding on the rim. Marvin stops, gets out of the 
               car, and looks at the tire.

                                     MARVIN
                         First he ruins my life, now he ruins 
                         my tire!

               Cursing to himself, Marvin walks to the trunk and removes a 
               jack.

                                     MARVIN
                         God! Damn! Son of a bitching! Bob!

               A WOMAN comes out of the house and joins the old man. They 
               watch in silence as Marvin jacks up his car. As he twists 
               and grimaces and kicks to get off the lug nuts, it starts to 
               RAIN.

                                     MARVIN
                         Shit piss crap! Son of a bitching 
                         douche bag asshole!

               THREE MORE PEOPLE come out on the porch and watch. As Marvin 
               struggles, the car slips off the jack and slams to the 
               pavement. Marvin begins kicking the tire and hitting it with 
               the jack.

                                     MARVIN
                         What about Bob?! Think about Bob! 
                         What about Bob? What about Bob? WHAT 
                         ABOUT BOB!!

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK

               Mumbling to himself, soaking wet, and filthy with tire grime, 
               Marvin walks to his house. He kicks open the front door.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'm home!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DUSK. MARVIN'S P.O.V.

               Lights go on. Thirty people stand around the room with party 
               favors and drinks. In unison they yell:

                                     PARTY GUESTS
                         Surprise!
                              (then sing:)
                         "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday 
                         to you! Happy Birthd...

               The singing tapers into silence. Flabbergasted by Marvin's 
               disheveled appearance, the party guests stare. Fay and the 
               kids approach, tentatively.

                                     SIGGY
                         Dad, what happened?

                                     MARVIN
                         Nothing.

                                     FAY
                         Leo, look at yourself!

                                     MARVIN
                         Just a little car trouble, hon. I'm 
                         fine.

               Fay is speechless. So are Siggy and Anna. Not wanting to let 
               things sink, party-hardy well-wishers approach Leo.

                                     PARTY GUEST 1
                         Happy Birthday, Leo.

                                     PARTY GUEST 2
                         Some night to have car trouble. You 
                         almost missed your own surprise party!

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Happy Birthday, Dr. M!

               Marvin turns and stares at Bob.

                                     BOB
                         I couldn't miss your birthday!

               Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He 
               pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.

                                     MARVIN
                         I want you dead! Dead, you hear me, 
                         dead!

               Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull 
               him off.

               INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the 
               party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest 
               whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man 
               who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's 
               bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak 
               in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.

                                     FAY
                         I've never seen him like this, Phil. 
                         He's got this delusion about Bob 
                         Wiley being the cause of all his 
                         problems and I don't know what to 
                         do.

                                     PHIL
                         He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His 
                         book, his interview which frankly 
                         didn't go so well, his birthday. 
                         That's a lot to bite off all at once. 
                         I'll give him a sedative and he'll 
                         be fine.

                                     FAY
                         You really think so?

               Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.

               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

               Bob sits on the couch beside Siggy. Anna approaches.

                                     ANNA
                         You feeling better?

                                     BOB
                         I'm fine. It's your dad I'm worried 
                         about. How is he?

                                     ANNA
                         Upstairs. Resting. I can't understand 
                         why he'd attack you like that.

               Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across 
               the room, smiling at Anna.

                                     BOB
                         I can't either. But one thing I've 
                         learned about psychiatrists: they're 
                         brilliant manipulators. I trust your 
                         dad completely. I'm sure everything 
                         he's done has been to help me.
                              (pause)
                         How come you aren't making a move on 
                         George Stark?

                                     ANNA
                              (glancing at George)
                         Bob, we've talked about this.

                                     BOB
                         No, you've talked about it and I've 
                         listened. In my opinion, George 
                         Stark's smile is not Oedipal 
                         regression and it's not confused 
                         libido. It's one good looking guy 
                         drooling over you, Anna Marvin.

                                     ANNA
                         Bob...

                                     BOB
                         Go ask if you can put your tongue in 
                         his mouth. I hear it works every 
                         time.

               Anna smiles then summons her courage, and smilingly approaches 
               George. He is clearly delighted. A woman walks up to Bob.

                                     WOMAN (LILY)
                         Hi. Fay said to introduce myself. 
                         I'm Lily, Leo's neurotic sister.

               We saw LILY MARVIN'S picture in Leo's office. Bob stands, 
               delighted.

                                     BOB
                         A pleasure. I'm neurotic too.

                                     LILY
                         Really, what a coincidence. Am I 
                         disturbing you?

                                     BOB
                         Only in a good way. Sit down.

               She does.

                                     BOB
                         It must be nice having an analyst in 
                         the family.

                                     LILY
                         I don't know, ask Leo. I'm an analyst 
                         too.

                                     BOB
                         You're kidding?!

               OMITTED

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. MARVIN'S DARKENED BEDROOM, NIGHT

               Phil empties a large syringe into Marvin's buttock. He swats 
               Marvin's behind and Marvin pulls up his pj's.

                                     PHIL
                         That should give you some interesting 
                         ideas for your next book. You might 
                         even wake up feeling happy.

                                     MARVIN
                         I doubt it. Phil, do you remember a 
                         classmate named Fensterwald?

                                     PHIL
                         Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could 
                         forget?

                                     MARVIN
                         I've forgotten and I don't know why. 
                         Did anything unusual happen with 
                         him?

                                     PHIL
                         You're joking.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do I act like a man who's joking?!

                                     PHIL
                         Relax, Leo. I just can't believe 
                         you'd block something like that out. 
                         Carswell was at Harvard with us. You 
                         turned him in for cheating.

                                     MARVIN
                         What...?

                                     PHIL
                         Don't you remember? You brought action 
                         against him for stealing your 
                         psychoanalysis notes and they booted 
                         him. The only place that would take 
                         him after that was University of 
                         Guadalajara.

               Marvin tries to speak but nothing comes out of his mouth. 
               Tomsky watches with concern.

                                     TOMKSY
                         Leo, is there something about Carswell 
                         that's disturbing you? Leo...?

                                     MARVIN
                         Thanks, Phil. Enjoy the party.

               Phil lingers then leaves, closing the door. Marvin begins 
               shaking all over. As he does the bed rattles rapidly against 
               the wall. Leo's losing it. He's no longer the same sane man. 
               In the darkness we hear:

                                     MARVIN
                         Baby steps, make a plan.

               INT. MARVIN'S BEDROOM, THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               Fay sleeps soundly next to Marvin who is wide eyed, staring 
               at the ceiling, twitching. Marvin pulls himself carefully 
               out of bed and crawls on the floor to the door.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin, carrying his shoes, crawls outside. He tries to put 
               his shoes on and falls flat on his face. He then pulls himself 
               up and hobbles away.

               EXT. THE WINNIPESAUKEE GENERAL STORE, MORNING

               This is where the Marvin family was shopping when Bob first 
               came to town. Marvin paces outside until the owner opens the 
               front door for business.

               INT. THE GENERAL STORE, MORNING

               Marvin wanders through the hardware section, looking around. 
               FRED, the owner, works behind the counter.

                                     FRED
                         Can I help you, doctor?

                                     MARVIN
                         I want to buy a gun.

                                     FRED
                         Okay.

               Fred walks to a case.

                                     FRED
                         I've got Winchesters. Colts. What do 
                         you plan on hunting?

                                     MARVIN
                         Er. An animal. This tall. Hundred 
                         and seventy pounds. Bermuda shorts.

                                     FRED
                         Take a look at this baby. It'll shoot 
                         through anything but it also leaves 
                         a clean wound.

               He hands Marvin a rifle. Marvin examines it.

                                     FRED
                         Your wife was in with that Bob fellow. 
                         Sure is a nice guy.

                                     MARVIN
                              (handing back the 
                              rifle)
                         What do you have that leaves a messy 
                         wound?

               ANGLE ON THE CASH REGISTER AREA

               Fred is ringing up Marvin's purchase: two rifles and a box 
               of shells.

                                     FRED
                         I'll need you driver's license, social 
                         security number, and you can pick 
                         them up on Friday...
                              (checks a calendar)
                         the 18th.

                                     MARVIN
                         The eighteenth?

                                     FRED
                         There's a two week waiting period in 
                         this state.

                                     MARVIN
                         I can't wait two weeks! I need these 
                         now!

               He grabs the rifles. Fred keeps a firm grip on them.

                                     FRED
                         Dr. Marvin, it's the law.

               Fred wins the tug-of-war. Marvin stares at him.

                                     MARVIN
                         What about explosives? Any waiting 
                         period there?

               EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING

               Marvin, carrying a bag and singing to himself, walks up to 
               the cottage. He looks around then kicks open the door.

               INT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING

               The place looks completely anonymous except for Gil in a 
               bowl and Bob's bag of clothes. Marvin sits on the floor, 
               filling a pair of milk cartons with gray powder.

                                     MARVIN
                              (singing)
                         "Bob fell in to a Burning ring of 
                         fire. He went down down down And the 
                         flames went higher. And it burned 
                         burned burned, That ring of fire. 
                         The ring of fire."

               Marvin removes a wired mechanism from the bag and a timer. 
               He delicately pushes the wires into the milk cartons then 
               carefully ties on some fuse wires. He puts the milk cartons 
               and wired mechanisms into a BACKPACK and puts it under Bob's 
               bed. He begins laying the fuse wire along the floor towards 
               the door.

               Marvin passed Gil, sitting on a table. Marvin picks up the 
               bowl and puts it under the bed next to the bomb. He then 
               goes back to laying the wire into the kitchenette.

               EXT. BOB'S COTTAGE, SAME

               Marvin lays the fuse wire across room and out the door. He 
               closes the door and starts to set the timer when he spots a 
               note hanging on the nearby mailbox:

                                     MARVIN
                              (reading aloud)
                         "Dear Mr. and Mrs. G., If I'm not 
                         here, I'm at the Marvins. Would you 
                         feed Gil? Thanks. Bob. P.S. Your 
                         denture adhesives arrived so I put 
                         them in your mailbox. Enjoy. Bob. "

               Marvin seethes. He thinks a moment then heads back into the 
               cottage. Momentarily he returns carrying the back pack and 
               the long wire fuse.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, DAY

               Bob, Anna and Siggy sit around watching Fay on the phone.

                                     FAY
                         Well if you hear from him, Donna, 
                         please call... Thanks.

               She hangs up.

                                     FAY
                         Nobody's seen him.

               She stands and gets her purse off the table.

                                     FAY
                         I'm going looking for him.

                                     ANNA
                         Me too.

                                     SIGGY
                         Me too.

                                     BOB
                         Me too.

                                     ANNA
                         Shouldn't somebody stay here in case 
                         he comes back?

                                     SIGGY
                         I'll stay.

                                     BOB
                         I'll stay.

                                     FAY
                         We'll leave him a note.

               She pauses then stops in front of Bob.

                                     FAY
                         Bob, I'm not defending Leo's recent 
                         behavior in any way, so please don't 
                         take this personally. However 
                         irrational the reasons, Leo is so 
                         upset with you that I think it would 
                         be best if you weren't around when 
                         he comes back.

                                     BOB
                         Really?

                                     SIGGY
                         Yeah, mom. Why?

                                     FAY
                         Because I say so, Siggy.
                              (to Bob)
                         Please don't think it's the way I 
                         want it. It's just that Leo's not 
                         himself.

                                     SIGGY
                         It's not Bob's fault.

                                     BOB
                         Listen to your mom, Siggy. All of 
                         you get out of here, okay? I'll 
                         straighten up before I go and when 
                         Dr. M. comes home, everything will 
                         be exactly the way he likes it.

                                     FAY
                         Bob you're such a dear. Take good 
                         care, all right?

               Fay hugs Bob. So does Anna.

                                     BOB
                         You give George a chance okay?

               Anna nods. Bob turns to Siggy who is upset. Bob holds out 
               his hand.

                                     BOB
                         Give me leather, ass wiping bastard 
                         head.

               Siggy swats Bob's hand.

                                     SIGGY
                         Green puking piss-ant.

               The family and Bob exchange pregnant good-bye looks, then 
               Fay and Siggy and Anna exit.

                                     BOB
                         Bye, fam.

               NEW ANGLE, OUT THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW, SAME

               Bob watches as the Marvin family walks away. They wave. Bob 
               waves back, sadly. He shuffles across the room. He stops at 
               the puppets on the mantle.

                                     BOB
                         I guess this is good-bye, fam.

               Bob shuffles to Marvin's chair. He stares at the book Marvin 
               has been trying to read, Freud's Understanding Dreams then 
               casually opens it. He reads for a moment, gets interested in 
               it and sits down. He sits back in Marvin's chair, reading.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, LATER

               Bob is asleep in Marvin's chair, Freud's Understanding Dreams 
               open on his chest. Suddenly Marvin's face pops up at the 
               window. He looks in, sees Bob, then ducks back down. 
               Momentarily, the front door to the cottage is kicked open 
               and there stands a seething Marvin.

                                     MARVIN
                         Get up and don't make a sound!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M.! Everybody's looking for you.

               Marvin brandishes the back pack.

                                     MARVIN
                         I said shut up!

                                     BOB
                         Okay. You're the doc.

               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE, SAME

               Marvin, carrying the back pack, leads Bob outside. Bob looks 
               relaxed.

                                     BOB
                         Where we going hiking?

                                     MARVIN
                         Into the woods.

                                     BOB
                         Is this is a new form of therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         Yeah, Bob, it's death therapy. It's 
                         a guaranteed cure.

                                     BOB
                         Death therapy. I like it.

               Marvin leads Bob into the woods beside the cottage.

               EXT. THE WOODS NEAR THE HOUSE, SAME

               Bob sits on a stump. Marvin puts the back pack on Bob's 
               shoulders then starts tying his hands behind him. Bob sits 
               passively, letting him.

                                     BOB
                         This is pretty imaginative, Dr. M. 
                         Will this be in your new book?

                                     MARVIN
                         If it is, I'll dedicate it to you, 
                         how's that?

                                     BOB
                         Great. Ow. That hurts. Ow.

               Marvin keeps tying Bob's hands.

                                     BOB
                         What is this now, pain therapy?

                                     MARVIN
                         Exactly. Now yell and scream and 
                         suffer!

                                     BOB
                         Ow! Ahh! Ow! That really hurts.

               Marvin sets the timer then walks away.

                                     MARVIN
                         Say hello to Freud for me.

               Marvin walks out of the woods.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M, this hurts!

                                     MARVIN (O.S.)
                         Love hurts.

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin enters, looking happy. He goes to the stereo, puts on 
               Neil Diamond's "Penny Arcade" and cranks it up loud, then 
               goes to the window and opens it.

                                     MARVIN
                              (yelling to the woods)
                         Music to die by, Bob!

               Marvin does a little dance and talks to himself.

                                     MARVIN
                         I guess it was suicide, Fay. He tried 
                         it once, remember. Just goes to show, 
                         you never can tell.

               EXT. THE WOODS, SAME

               Bob sits trying to get comfortable.

                                     BOB
                         I'm worried about getting gangrene, 
                         Dr. M! I think I get the point!

               He struggles some more.

                                     BOB
                              (to himself)
                         At least I think I get the point.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe I'm not supposed to sit here.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe I'm supposed to undo these 
                         outer knots...

               He begins struggling to untie himself.

                                     BOB
                         So that my inner knots..., these 
                         strong..., restricting..., inner 
                         knots...

               He gets a hand free.

                                     BOB
                         Will come undone too.

               Both hands free, Bob stands.

                                     BOB
                         Yes!

               INT. THE MARVIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin is still dancing around, looking at his watch. He 
               holds up five, four, three, two, one fingers then prepares 
               for an explosion. Instead Bob opens the door.

                                     MARVIN
                         Ahh!

               Still wearing the back pack, Bob walks into the room.

                                     BOB
                         Death therapy cured me!

               Marvin runs across the room away from Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         No!

                                     BOB
                         Yes! I used to be so afraid of 
                         everything, it was like dying a 
                         thousand deaths a day. Now, that you 
                         showed me I have only one death to 
                         be afraid of, I'm not afraid of 
                         anything anymore!

                                     MARVIN
                         NOOOO!

               Marvin runs out the back door of the house. Bob stands there 
               watching him.

                                     BOB
                         Don't be so modest!

               EXT. THE MARVIN DOCK, DAY

               Marvin runs out to the dock and tries to start the little 
               motor boat that sits there. Bob stops at the back door of 
               the house, casually tosses the back pack onto a chair, then 
               follows Marvin.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M.?

               Bob walks out onto the dock. Marvin is working frantically 
               to start the motorboat.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., I'm really cured!

               The house explodes. Debris rains down on Bob and Marvin. 
               After it settles, the bust of Freud lands on the dock in 
               front of them.

                                     BOB
                         Did somebody leave the gas on?

                                     MARVIN
                         Why won't you go away! I disgraced 
                         myself on national television! No 
                         one will buy my book! My family's 
                         going to hate me!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M., your family loves you.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'M FINISHED!

               Marvin is about to attack Bob then stands limp, a beaten 
               man. What's left of the house is now burning. The Guttmans 
               have run out of their trailer.

                                     THE GUTTMANS
                         Burn. Burn! Burn!!

               In the distance, SIRENS APPROACH.

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of 
                         England all around you. You have a 
                         wife with a generous heart. You have 
                         great kids and an incredible sister.

                                     MARVIN
                         Stay away from my sister!

                                     BOB
                         Dr. M, you have a fam!

               Marvin stares at Bob then takes a small can of gas from the 
               old motorboat and pours gas on himself. The SIRENS get closer.

                                     BOB
                         You know, I'm beginning to think 
                         you're an ingrate.

                                     MARVIN
                         What?!

                                     BOB
                         People are miserable all over the 
                         world and you're killing yourself? 
                         You should be ashamed.

                                     MARVIN
                         Don't talk that way to me!

                                     BOB
                         Maybe I was wrong about you.

                                     MARVIN
                         Do you hear me?!

                                     BOB
                         Maybe you're not so good after all.

               Marvin leaps on Bob.

                                     MARVIN
                         I'll kill you!

               Marvin attacks Bob on the dock. Fire trucks arrive. Fay and 
               the family drive up too. As a couple of FIREMEN and the family 
               rush to separate Marvin and Bob...

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DOCTORS' HOUSE BOAT, SUNSET

               The doctors and their wives sit around Phil, stunned. Off 
               their bow is the slab that was once the Marvin house.

                                     PHIL
                         And they took him away.

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         My god, it was insanity. Bob drove 
                         Marvin to complete insanity!

                                     WIFE
                         What happened?

                                     PHIL
                         Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute 
                         for a few days for observation. He 
                         lost his medical license, of course. 
                         A doctor can't try to kill one of 
                         his patients and expect to get away 
                         with it.

                                     WIFE
                         Well thank god for that.
                              (the other doctors 
                              stare daggers at her)
                         I mean..., you know... I mean...
                              (pause)
                         Then what happened?

                                     PHIL
                         Leo was returned to his family.

               EXT. THE TOMSKY CONVALESCENT HOME, DAY

               Leo stands, small suitcase in hand, looking sad and fragile. 
               Fay, Anna, Siggy, Lily and Bob get out of the station wagon 
               and look at him. No one says a word, then Bob goes up and 
               puts his arms around Leo. Leo stands motionless, shell 
               shocked.

                                     PHIL (O.S.)
                         Bob and the family rented a lakeside 
                         cottage where they could help Leo 
                         recuperate.

               EXT. THE LAWN OF A LAKESIDE COTTAGE, DAY

               Gil's bowl sits on a lawn table. In addition to Gil, the 
               bowl now contains several baby guppies. Marvin lies on a 
               deck chair, covered with a blanket, staring into nowhere. 
               Bob is next to him, talking on a cordless phone.

                                     BOB
                              (into phone)
                         I understand. Sure.

               He hangs up and puts the phone down.

                                     BOB
                              (to Leo)
                         Tough business.

               Bob makes some notes in his organizer then gets up. He grabs 
               hold of both of Leo's shoulders.

                                     BOB
                              (reassuringly)
                         I'm going over here. I'll be right 
                         over here.

               Leo doesn't look at him. A zombie would seem more alive. Bob 
               goes and joins the volleyball game.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm with Siggy.

               Marvin sits staring into nowhere. The phone rings. Again.

                                     MARVIN
                              (almost inaudible)
                         Phone.

               The volleyball game continues.

                                     MARVIN
                              (a touch louder)
                         Phone.

               After another ring, he reaches for it.

                                     MARVIN
                              (INTO PHONE)
                              (listlessly affectless)
                         Hello.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         May I speak to Bob, please?

                                     MARVIN
                              (still staring into 
                              nowhere)
                         Bob's... unavailable right now. Can... 
                         I take a message?

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         I'm Mr. Jameson with the Tucson school 
                         district. Bob contacted us about 
                         buying some toothbrushes but we're 
                         going to have to cancel the order.

                                     MARVIN
                              (writing)
                         Tucson canceling order... Any message 
                         why?

                                     JAMESON
                              (on phone)
                         It's not a priority right now.

                                     MARVIN
                              (writing)
                         Not priority... right now.
                              (pause)
                         Why?

                                     JAMESON
                              (ON PHONE)
                         Well... money's tight and...

                                     MARVIN
                         Sure.
                              (pause)
                         Though, you know there is another 
                         way to look at it.

                                     JAMESON
                              (ON PHONE)
                         What's that?

                                     MARVIN
                         Well... if you gave a new toothbrush 
                         and taught dental hygiene to every 
                         student at your school... In the 
                         long run you'd save them thousands 
                         of dollars. I mean look at the cost 
                         of dental bills. I bet I could have 
                         put my kids through college with 
                         what I've spent on fillings.

                                     JAMESON
                         That's an interesting point.

                                     MARVIN
                         It is, isn't it?
                              (pause)
                         Maybe you should try the toothbrushes. 
                         You might do a lot for education by 
                         saving teeth.

                                     JAMESON
                         Huh. I never thought of that.
                              (pause)
                         I tell you what. Tell Bob we'll take 
                         the order and see how it goes.

                                     MARVIN
                         Great.

               Marvin hangs up the phone. He affectless expression suddenly 
               turns to one full of thought.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay.

               Marvin sits up, gaining energy, even enthusiasm.

                                     MARVIN
                         Fay!

               The Marvin family hurries over.

                         Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.

               Bob puts his arm around Leo as he gestures and talks more 
               and more animatedly to his delighted family.

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         The irony, of course, is that Bob 
                         brought the family closer than they'd 
                         ever been before. Harvey Green saw 
                         Leo last month and said he never 
                         looked happier.

               EXT. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE BOAT

               The doctors are stunned.

                                     FEINBERG
                         My god. The poor bastard.

                                     ANOTHER DOCTOR
                         And you thought you had nightmares.

                                     FEINBERG
                         Unbelievable...

                                     WIFE
                         What happened to Bob?

               The others jump in: "Yeah, what about Bob? What about Bob? 
               What about Bob?"

                                     PHIL
                         Bob married Lily and had triplets. 
                         He went back to school, got a degree 
                         in marriage-family-counseling, and 
                         now has a big practice on Park and 
                         75th.

               INT. BOB WILEY'S MANHATTAN OFFICE, DAY

               Bob sits in the shrink's chair. Sitting in three chairs in 
               front of him are a FATHER, MOTHER, and SON.

                                     SON
                         Douche bag.

                                     MOTHER
                         Bastard head!

                                     FATHER
                         Son of a bitch!

                                     BOB
                              (gently to the father)
                         Try ass wipe of the universe.

                                     FATHER
                         Ass wipe of the universe!

               The family look at each other. Tears well. They hug.

                                     BOB
                         Excellent.

               EXT. THE DOCTORS ON THE BOAT

               The doctors look at each other in astonishment.

                                     DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
                         Wait a minute. You're not telling me 
                         that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley, 
                         the psychologist?!

                                     PHIL
                         That's exactly what I'm telling you.

               A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.

                                     PHIL
                         Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!

               ANGLE ON THE BIG HOUSEBOAT

               Bob is surrounded by Lily Marvin, three toddlers and lots of 
               friends. Smiling, Bob waves at the doctors.

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         Wrote that huge best seller? What's 
                         it called?

               Bob's boat turns. On it's stern, in huge letters is it's 
               name: "Vacation Therapy".

                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
                         Vacation Therapy!

                                     PHIL (V.O.)
                         Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.

               ANGLE ON THE DOCTORS BOAT

               who are dark green with envy.

                                     DOCTOR 2
                         I don't believe it!

                                     DOCTOR 1
                         Pinch me!

                                     FEINBERG
                         I'll never take another vacation as 
                         long as I live!

               ANGLE ON BOB'S HOUSEBOAT

               As the other doctors second in agreement, WE SEE Bob's hugely 
               happy houseboat motors off. We see Bob's big smile as he 
               passes out Kleenex to his family then waves good-bye to the 
               doctors.

               ROLL END CREDITS.

                                         THE END
