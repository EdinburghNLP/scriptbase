                                    Written by

                            Rob Festinger &amp; Todd Field

                         

                         

<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          THE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE
</b>
<b>          EXT. GI'S POINT
</b>
          We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
          younger, in hot pursuit.
          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.

<b>                         CLOSER NOW
</b>          We see them in glimpses:
          Their eyes - Lips - Hands
          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
          She reaches out and strokes his hand.
          He stares at their fingers mingling together.
          The woman sighs.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          I Love it here.
          I know you do...

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          I can feel my life - ya know.
          He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.
          A legend appears: Il -_ 1
          THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:

<b>          T. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN
</b>          A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and
          disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from
          Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been
          listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This
          broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and
          cannot be-" -

<b>          EXT. EMERSON ROAD - S
</b>
          The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year
          old clapboard two-story affairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         2
</b>
<b>          EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - S
</b>
          Standing. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
          the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually
          with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
          Natalie smiles back.

<b>                         NATALIE
</b>          Morn'in Dr. Fowler.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys?

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Great!
          Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
          climbs inside the cab.
          Frank kneels down to Duncan.

<b>                         F
</b>          Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not
          coming?
          Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder.
          Duncan pulls away.
          Frank looks up to Natalie for help.

<b>                         F
</b>          He can come if he wants ...we can manage,
          really.
          She smiles and shakes her head.

<b>                         NATALIE
</b>          ahead. He wants to stay here.

<b>                         F
</b>          Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time.
          ,Qy
          Natalie kisses him and they're off.

<b>          INTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING
</b>          Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of
          hero :worship in his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          I NT. STROUT &amp; SONS CANNERY - DAWN
</b>          Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their
          journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
          cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we
          will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT &amp; SONS.

<b>          I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN
</b>          A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their
          bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning
          small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs
          to their equipment, and so on.
          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
          used as a scratch pad for years.
          Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.

<b>          EXT. HARBOR - SAME
</b>
          A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The
          bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with
          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
          the shoes pick up the pace.

<b>          EXT. HARBOR - S
</b>
          Matt &amp; Frank prepare the rig.
          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
          exotic.
          Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.

<b>                         F
</b>          C'mon up Jace.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Hold on a second. Need to know if he's
          ready first - Jason, can you tell me
          what's important?
          Jason hesitates.

<b>                         F
</b>          on tell h°

<b>                         JASON
</b>
<b>                         (NERVOUS)
</b>          "A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark
          afternoon, a note in music--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         L
</b>          He takes a breath.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          and the way the back of a baby's neck
          smells if its mother keeps it tidy."

<b>                         MATT
</b>
<b>                         (TO FRANK)
</b>          You taught h' well.
          Jason beams.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          - come aboard sailor.
          Matt reaches down to give a hand up.
          Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life.

<b>          EXT. HARBOR LATER
</b>
          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Thank you.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Ever been over there?

<b>                         JASON
</b>          No sir.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?

<b>                         JASON
</b>          How'd you get back?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Off the island?
          Jason nods.
          We rowed.
          Matt smiles at the memory.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         5
</b>
<b>                         MATT
</b>          Then we got a little outboard. That was
          great. A seven and a half horsepower it
          was - we lived there until I was about
          your age - then we left and became
          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.

          Matt hides a smile about to form.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Yep, Jason - we all are.
          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.

<b>                         F
</b>          At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
          LINE into the WINCH.
          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
          surfaces.
          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Oh boy you see what happened to
          this poor fel ow?

<b>                         JASON
</b>          .what?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Well, the trap has nylon nets called
          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
          lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
          escaping--you know the old saying "two's
          company three-s a crowd"?
          Jason nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Well{ it's like that. You get more than
          two in a bedroom and chances are
          something like this is going to happen.
          That's why Frank can't leave these traps
          for more than a day.
          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
          are black balls on both sides of the tail.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Now the older females like this of gal,
          are the most dan erous - especially when
          they're growin' eyries.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Berries?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Eggs... .one of these can take out two
          males easy - Then you wind up with
          lobster you can't sell - and as for this
          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
          says you have to let her go.
          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.

<b>                         TT
</b>          Can you handle this?
          Jason nods.

          He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Go ahead now, put it in the tank.
          Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.

          forty plus years.
          Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
          through a plastic bread bag.
          Willis looks past him, distracted.

          Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
          A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe
          the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap).

          The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's

          Richard, Frank and Natalie are talking, but there are long pauses

          Finally, Richard smiles, turns, and exits. Alone.
          Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard.
          Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly.
          Matt takes a breath, and exhales. He turns to Ruth with a
          comforting smile, but
          she's just entering the house. The screen door closes behind

          Lord Bullingdon is on screen. Bullingdon's pistol misfires.

<b>                         LORD BULLINGDON
</b>          Sir Richard this pistol must be faulty -
          I must have another.

<b>          AIDE TO RIC
</b>          I'm sorry Lord Bullingdon but you must
          first stand your ground and allow Mr.
          Lyndon his turn to fire.

<b>                         SIR RIC
</b>          That is correct Lord Bullingdon - your
          pistol has fired and that counts as your
          shot--Mr. Lyndon are the rules of firing
          clear to you?

<b>                         YES -

          Bullingdon is overwrought. He looks like he may vomit.
          Ruth leans over to Matt.

<b>                         RUTH

          Matt lies in bed reading. He lowers his book and watches her

<b>                         MATT

<b>          INT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY

          Natalie drives down Emerson Road.
          As she approaches her house, she sees a Brown Suburban sitting
          in her driveway. She looks confused.

<b>                         THE KITCHEN
</b>          Natalie enters with groceries.
          Richard is seated at the kitchen table. He's finishing the first half
          of a sandwich. He drains a glass of milk.
          Natalie sets her purse down on the counter, and starts cleaning
          up his mess.

<b>                         NATALIE

          the final drops into his glass

          She throws the carton out. She takes a seat, and stares at him
          like a teacher counselling a troubled youth.

          He kicks back the last of the milk, wipes his mouth.

<b>                         RIC

          sharing a cigarette with Frank, who is on his hands &amp; knees
          finishing an elaborte structure with a set of FROEBEL wooden

          the idea of separating the family so that
          the kids were on one side and the parents
          on the other, so they would all spill into

          Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
          ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
          place of pure self. The song ends.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          That was really good! OK it's 7:30
          we should stop.
          The girls gather up their things quickly.

          Matt holds Frank's jaw. He gently turns his face toward the
          lamp.
          Frank has stitches over his right eye. The blood under the
          white of the pupil oozing. Both lips are bright and swollen.

          Without warning, Ruth leaves and goes upstairs.

<b>          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>          Ruth lies on her side reading. Matt comes in from the
          hallway.
          He stares at her.
          She ignores him.
          Finally, she turns over and faces him.

</b>          Maybe he still loves her.
          Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the
          hallway. He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs.
          He gets up and closes the bedroom door.

<b>          I NT. F R HOUSE F 'S ROOM - S

          nonplussed by what he sees.

          bruises have all but healed, the stitches replaced by a
          butterfly bandage. They eat cod tongues and cheeks. Drink soda
          pop from bottles.

          For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they

          a arently sleeping. Crumbled tissues litter the bed, the
          f oor,
          Matt ietl moves to her. He reaches down, about to touch her
          head. Something stops h°

          door, then pauses.

</b>          Matt slowly enters. He looks around, as if freezing the room in
          his memory.
          The place is untouched. Frank's many sketches are still pinned to the
          wall. Some clothes lie scattered on the floor. His fishing cap.
          Matt starts to pick up. He takes Frank's clothes from the floor
          and places them on his bed.
          He looks at a dirty T-shirt in his hand. He brings it to his face. He
          inhales deeply, able to smell his son's lingering scent-
          Finally, he sets the shirt on the bed. Wanders around. Strays
          near Frank's drafting table-
          He reaches out, touching the table, grazing°the topogra h of
          scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it- The Froe e Gifts.
          He takes a seat at the table. Feeling its frame, the sketches,
          the seat below-
          And without warning he is overcome. He lurches forward,
          burying his face in his hands. The sobs come unrestrained,
          violently, like a sudden tidal wave.

          didn't know what was happening downstairs. I was
          getting worried. I asked Jason to read Dunk a
          story. He didn't want a story - He wanted to come
          with me ... so I sat him back down on the bunk
          and I left them in the room.

          Davis takes a seat across from them.

</b>          You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just
          not set up that way.

</b>          In this case Strout's family was prepared to
          put up a substantial amount of property as
          bail - That, along with his ties to the

          judge of a serious "Risk of Flight".

</b>          Oh - I see.

<b>                         DAVIS
</b>          It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil
          suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till
          after the crimminal trial.
          Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is
          one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man
          chasing an ambulance. It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer."

</b>          Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve
          and eighteen months?

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          I thought you said there would be a jury
          trial sometime in October!?

<b>                         DAVIS
</b>          If he was incarcerated the udge would
          move for an October date - basically to
          save the County the cost of housing and
          feeding him as an inmate - But with bail
          the court date, unfortunately, is always
          later.

</b>          Hard to say really. Anywhere between five
          to fifteen years. We think we have a good
          shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good
          behavior, he'd do a full ten.

          this?
          Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis.
          Davis sits back, a little shook up.

<b>                         DAVIS

          Unfortunately, in situations like this
          when there is no eye witness, there ...
          well, there's not a lot we can do.

          she saw that it was made up of mothers

          opens for a large fishing boat. The bridge is operated by one

<b>                         MATT
</b>          I... ...sure. I'll take some.

<b>                          KRISTEN
</b>           Terrific, how many? We have a special
          today, 6 bars for ten dollars.
          Ok...sure.
           if by rote, Matt pulls out his wallet and hands her a ten.

<b>                          KRISTEN

<b>                         MATT
</b>          Okay ---
          He's about to close the door.

<b>                         KRISTEN
</b>          if you could just sign this. I have to
          give you a receipt. I'm sorry .this pen--
          Matt hands her one from his pocket.
          Matt waits as the girl fills out and hands him the receipt.
          He closes the door before she can thank h°

<b>          THE LIVING ROOM
</b>          Ruth is curled up on the couch.
          Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go.
          He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his
          hands - sets it on the coffee table
          He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.

<b>                         MATT

          He looks at her, as she starts to cry.
          He moves closer to her.

<b>                         MATT

          school, and I couldn't forgive her. I was
          so...
          She lets go, crying hard.
          He lifts her head onto his lap.
          He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from
          her forehead as she sobs into his lap.

<b>                         RUTH

          Matt nods, but he's not really clear.

          Then.

</b>          Richard...
          She breaks into sobs.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          .and I don't know what to do.

          Matt still strokes her hair.
          But he's in another world.

<b>          INTO GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>          The game has just started. Willis deals. Henry, Carl &amp; Willis
          pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on
          vacation; but he can see the affection an courtesy.in their
          eyes.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          The ne of the game is Texas Chase'
          He groans.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          Is there a problem?

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Why do you delude yourself with that
          crap?

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          What are you talking about?

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Look we're not in Vegas. It's five card
          draw, or seven card stud.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>
<b>                         (ENJOYING THIS)
</b>          That's what I said five card draw - jacks
          to open - Carl?

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Asshole,
          Matt smiles. He's missed these guys.

<b>                          CARL
</b>          I'll open with a dollar.

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Raise a buck.
          The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
          time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
          This stops him.
          Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
          for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
          He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
          someone to bust him.
          He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile
          uncomfortably. He can't take it.

<b>                         TT

          This wakes them up.

          just gonna let me stare at these cards
          all night!?
          No one wants to make the first move.
          This upsets Matt even more.

<b>                         MATT
</b>          O.K. fine!
          He stares back down at his cards.
          Finally it is Carl who speaks.
          There are things of which I may not speak;
          There are dreams that cannot die;
          There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
          And bring a pallor into the cheek,
          And a mist before the eye.
          And the words of that fatal song
          come over me like a chill:
          A boy's will is the wind's will,
          And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.
          Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes.
          The two men regard each other.

<b>          EXT. GRINNEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

          The game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as
          the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to
          leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand
          on his shoulder.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          Come back in for a drink.

<b>          I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE- ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
</b>          Willis and Matt step back in, closing the door behind them.

<b>          KATIE O.S.
</b>          Honey, are you coming to bed now?
          Willis moves to the steps leading upstairs.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          Soon baby, Matt's still here.

<b>           KATIE 0.S. 11 %-?.:

<b>          I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>          A few minutes later.
          Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture
          hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly
          interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing
          time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A
          pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as
          the center piece.
          Willis comes down from upstairs.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          She's all set - now what can I get you?

<b>                         MATT

          Willis nods and takes a seat.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          - you back on the wagon?
          He is.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          Sit down Matt you're making me nervous.
          Matt takes a seat.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          I'm glad you came tonight.

<b>                         MATT

</b>          Mom always liked little dogs - this one
          was a - Pekingese, I think. I remember
          hearing this yelp, and then a scream.
          Frank ran out pointing to his finger. I
          looked at it couldn't see an thino. Mom
          said Frank must have "cornered the dog"
          and I knew she was probably right. We
          were driving home, and Ruth noticed Frank
          itching his a ..she pulled back his
          sleeve, and there were these two deep,
          bloody, puncture marks...

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          Why do you think he pointed to his

          Matt shakes his head.

          He stares into his hands, as the memory crystallizes.
          Willis looks confused, and somewhat uncomfortable.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          He gets up and heads to the bar.

<b>                         MATT

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          I was thinking just the other day about
          the last time Frankie was-
          Matt cuts him off.
          His name was Ar k. Not Frankie.

          said a word - She saw him at South End.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          For a friend. Ever notice even the worst
          bastards have friends? Nobody knows him

          They drink what he mixes
          Willis sets a can of Moxie down in front of Matt.

<b>                         WILLIS
</b>          (referring to the can)
          I don't know how you drink this stuff
          it's what drove me to beer as a child.
          He sits down with his own drink.
          A moment.

<b>                         WILLIS

</b>          yeah, we have.
          Finally, he looks up, his eyes meeting Willis I s.

<b>          THE SOUND OF A LONE F VOICE - SINGING
</b>
<b>          EXT. CAMDEN AMPHITHEATER - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
          The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet. We turn to
          find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll.
          A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk
          as the sun dies. Looking around we see an ancient gazebo -
          then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the
          foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us -
          The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly
          embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae
          Mama. "
          The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening.
          The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an -
          AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor. Ruth stands at the

          the jam and the door.
          He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror. He can hear

<b>          3TONNE'S SPECIALTY SHOPPE

<b>          EXT. SIDE STREET - MATT'S NEIGHBORHOOD DAWN
</b>
          The Ford pulls up to the curb. Matt gets out.
          Willis drives away.
          Matt starts walking.

<b>          EXT. F RSTREET -S
</b>
          The STREET LIGHTS suddenly turn off',.
          The world is waking up now.

<b>          EXT. FOWLER STREET - S
</b>
          In the distance, Matt can see his house.
          The birds all seem to wake at once.
          Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
          kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
          surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.
          He picks up his pace.

<b>          I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - B.
</b>          Matt enters.

<b>          T LAUNDRY ROOM - S
</b>          He roves his tennis shoes, his pants, he starts unbuttoning
          his shirt. Now in his T-shirt and boxers, he examines his
          clothes and shoes carefully, before putting them into the
          washer - He pours detergent inside - and starts the cycle.
          He steps to a little sink and washes up.

<b>                         DINING ROOM
</b>          The light has been left on, he kills it and heads upstairs.

<b>          UPSTAIRS - S.
</b>          Matt slowly walks down the hall, to

<b>                         BEDROOM -S
</b>          And stands in the doorway. He pauses, seeing only
          the orange ember of Ruth's cigarette, in the dark.

<b>                         (UNSEEN)
</b>          Did you do it?
          He doesn-t answer. He walks in and comes to bed, climbing in as
          Ruth moves over.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          Are you all right?
          He lies down. FACES THE WINDOW, AWAY FROM HER.
          She is on her side, she props herself up on her elbow -
          watching him.
          He waits a longtime before speaking

<b>                         MATT
</b>          There was a picture with Natalie and the
          boys hanging on his wall -
          Ruth looks at him strangely.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>
<b>                         (GENTLY)
</b>          .what is it, Matt?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          - the way she was smiling.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          What?

<b>                         MATT
</b>          I don't know -
          Ruth looks at the back of Matt's head.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          Matt?
          He doesn't move. He says nothing else.
          She continues to stare at him.
          Uncertainty beginning to form on her face. She looks lost. If only
          things cou d be as t ey were.
          Then.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          at I thinking - you must be hungry.
          She waits for a response, but gets e. She gets out of bed,
          leaves the room and heads down stairs.

<b>          LONG EMPTY WAY.
</b>          WE EEAR RUTH downstairs in the kitchen.

<b>          RUTH 0. S.
</b>          Matt?
          Matt just lies there, in another world.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          Matt dear, do you want coffee?
          Be doesn't respond. Instead he looks at his finger.
          The bandage wet from washing up.
          He slides it off easily, like oversized ring.
          The skin has healed.

<b>                         LATER NOW
</b>          Sun light creeps in through the curtains, onto Matt's face.
          Ruth lies sleeping on his chest.
          A breakfast tray at his bedside which he hasn't touched
          Matt is cede awake. He stares at the ceiling Reliving it
          His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.
          The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.
          But he won't. Not today.
          There is a small crack in the ceiling.
          He'll have to fix that.
