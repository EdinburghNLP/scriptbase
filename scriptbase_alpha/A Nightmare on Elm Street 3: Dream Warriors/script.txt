                    A Nightmare on Elm Street 3:  
                          Dream Warriors

                         A Screenplay By:
                    Wes Craven and Bruce Wagner

     FADE IN:

     A COMPLETELY BLACK SCREEN.  THE FOLLOWING QUOTE IS SUPERED:

                    "Sleep.  Those little slices 
                    of death.  How I loathe them."

                            -- Edgar Allan Poe

                                                      FADE TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" BLARES from a radio as 
     we begin a CLOSUP MONTAGE:

     CLOSEUP - A YOUNG GIRL'S HAND

     dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix.

     CLOSEUP - THE WETTED PAPER

     is applied to a paper mache surface, and a popsicle stick is 
     pressed into place.  (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being 
     constructed.)

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER

     Kristen (16) is strikingly pretty, despite the dark, tired circles 
     under her eyes.  She's exhausted, but desperately trying to stay 
     awake.  She wears pajamas and robe.

     Her head nods, her eyelids close.  She snaps herself awake.

     CLOSEUP - THE RADIO

     She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER.

     CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK

     It's 1:20 a.m.

     CLOSEUP - A JAR OF FOLGER'S COFFEE CRYSTALS

     She scoops out a spoonful.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     She puts the spoonful of coffee crystals in her mouth and chases 
     it down with a swig of Diet Coke.

     CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE

     Another piece is applied.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     Nodding off again.  She rouses herself angrily.

     WIDER ANGLE

     The bedroom door opens and her mother enters.  ELAINE PARKER, late 
     30's, is dressed in an expensive evening gown that carefully 
     displays her assets.  She snaps the radio off.

                              ELAINE
               Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole
               neighborhood!

                              KRISTEN
                         (bleary-eyed)
               Hi Mom.

                              ELAINE
               Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still
               doing up?  It's past one!

                              KRISTEN
               I thought I'd wait for you.

                              ELAINE
                         (softening)
               Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
               to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

                              KRISTEN
               It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

                              ELAINE
                         (turning down the bed)
               Kristen, don't start with me.  You know
               what your shrink said...

                              KRISTEN
                         (sullen)
               He's full of shit.

                              ELAINE
               I am not going to let you get me into an
               argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now
               get in bed.

     Kristen does as she's told.  Her mother goes to the door and 
     reaches for the light switch.

                              KRISTEN
                         (a soft plea)
               Mom?  I'm still having these awful dreams.

     A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

                              MAN (O.S.)
               Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

                              ELAINE
               I'll be right down!
                         (to Kristen)
               Look honey, I've got a guest.

                              KRISTEN
               And you don't want to keep him waiting.

                              ELAINE
               That's right.  I don't.

     The door closes, shutting Kristen into darkness.  She lies in bed, 
     blinking back angry tears.  She turns on her side, her gaze 
     falling on:

     THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT

     It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight.  A crude, 
     homemade replica of the Elm Street House.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     Staring at the tiny house, hearing her mother's FAINT LAUGHTER 
     downstairs.

     Kristen begins to nod off, though she's fighting it.

     A breeze starts up, rustling her hair.  Leaves fall across her 
     pillow and face.  Her mother's LAUGHTER FADES OUT, replaced by teh 
     EERIE GIGGLING of small children.  She awakes with a start.

     CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, CRANING UP TO REVEAL:

     Kristen's bed sits in the middle of the dark, deserted street in 
     front of the Elm Street House.

     Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn.  The boys are dressed in 
     suits, the girls in party dresses.  They are jumping rope and 
     chanting a singsong:

                              CHILDREN
               One, two, Freddy's coming for you, 
               three, four, better lock your door,
               five, six, grab your crucifix...

     KRISTEN

     gets out of bed and approaches the children, transfixed.

     ...except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red 
     tricycle near the front door, hair billowing in the breezes as she 
     stares at Kristen.

                              LITTLE GIRL
               Hello.  What's your name?

                              KRISTEN
               Kristen.  What's yours?

     The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly, but doesn't answer.

                              KRISTEN (cont.)
               What is this place?

     The wind kicks up, MOANING.  We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES.

     THE WIND CHIME

     Tinkling in the wind.  The "chimes" are long razors.

     KRISTEN

     reacts.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl.  
     Darkness within.

                              LITTLE GIRL
                         (sadly)
               I have to go now.  Bye.

     RINGING the bell on the handlebar, she pedals her tricycle through 
     the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside.

                              KRISTEN
               Wait!  Don't go in there!

     Too late.  Kristen stands alone.  Fighting her fear, she 
     approaches the house.

     INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kristen enters.  The place is barren, empty.  Broken windows, 
     flaking paint, rotted walls.  Leaves skitter across teh floor.

                              KRISTEN
               Little girl!

     THE CHILDREN

     They sense her presence and turn their vacant, staring eyes toward 
     her.  They scatter, vanishing into the shadows...

     She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of 
     the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house.  Then 
     silence again.  Kristen tries to follow the sounds.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see:

     HER POV

     A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at 
     the far end of a long, twisted corridor.  The walls are streaked 
     with rust...or perhaps dried blood.

     KRISTEN

     She keeps following.  Being led.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy 
     steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG.  The 
     riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house.

     Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open.  A stairway 
     leading down into darkness.

     STAIRWAY

     Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps.

     INT. BOILER ROOM

     Kristen fearfully enters Freddy's decrepit lair.  Ancient rusted 
     boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows.

     The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristen's attention.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop 
     before Kristen.

                              LITTLE GIRL
               This is where he takes us.

     There is a SCREECH OF METAL.  Kristen whirls and sees:

     A BOILER

     The rusted furnace door is swinging open, metal grating on metal.  
     Inside, the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash.  A 
     tricycle lies in the carnage, identical to the Little Girl's -- 
     only charred.

     KRISTEN

     Horrified.  Suddenly, a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness.  
     THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach, BOOMING CLOSER.

     THE LITTLE GIRL

     looks up at Kristen with sad eyes.

                              LITTLE GIRL
                         (eerily calm)
               Freddy's home.

     THE BOILER FURNACE

     Now alive with ROARING FLAMES.  The tricycle's paint bubbles and 
     scorches in the intense heat.

     KRISTEN

     scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror.  
     She glances back over her shoulder to see:

     FREDDY

     looming from the row of boilers, an indistinct silhouette in the 
     hellish smoke and flames.  His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through 
     the chamber.

     KRISTEN

     ducks through a doorway into another room, still carrying the 
     Little Girl.

     INT. ROOM

     A hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling, strung up in the 
     darkness like butchered meat.

     KRISTEN

     gazes in horror.  She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her 
     arms -- she is now a horribly charred, brittle corpse.  Suddenly, 
     her tiny mouth bursts open, emitting a ghastly, ear-splitting 
     SCREAM!

                                                  SHOCK CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     As she sits bolt upright in bed, panting in terror, face bathed in 
     sweat.  She looks around, recognizing her own room.

     She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom.

     INT - BATHROOM

     She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror.  
     Still trembling, she runs water in the sink and splashes her face, 
     trying to calm down.

     The water becomes too hot.  Steam rises.

     She tries to turn the water off, but the pressure increases.  More 
     Steam.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     She fiddles with the handle, confused.

     As she turns it, the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life, 
     grasping her hand.

     KRISTEN

     gasps and looks up.  Freddy's face grins out at her from the 
     mirror.  She SCREAMS.  Steam billows up.

     THE SINK

     The other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch, turning into 
     Freddy's claw hand.  Finger razors grow.

     KRISTEN

     SCREAMING, struggling to break free.

     FREDDY

     leering from the mirror, laughing.  The claw hand rises up into 
     frame, poising to slash Kristen's exposed wrist.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     SCREAMING as the blades slash downward.

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY

     Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror.

     THE BATHROOM DOOR

     bursts open, revealing Kristen's mother.  She SCREAMS.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM

     No steam.  The mirror and sink are normal...except for the thin 
     streaks of spattered blood.

     Kristen turns to her mother, slowly waking from her dream.  She 
     holds a bloody razor in her hand.  Her wrist is slashed.

                              KRISTEN
                         (dazed, weak)
               Mommy...?

     She collapses.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

     Isolated and somewhat gothic, it's an enormous multi-winged 
     structure built by the Catholic Church in the 1920's.  A belltower 
     is centerpiece to several rambling wings.  Originally an insane 
     asylum, it is now a modernized state-run facility.  An iron fence 
     surrounds the sprawling grounds.

     INT. HOSPITAL - ADOLESCENT WING - DAY

     DOLLYING with MAX, the burly black Chief Orderly, as he makes his 
     morning rounds.  He wheels a rolling cart containing a variety of 
     medications down the hall.  A NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes from the 
     small portable radio dangling from the cart:

                              NEWSCASTER
               In local nows, two more teenage deaths
               have occurred -- both suicides.  County
               health officials are at a loss to explain
               this alarming trend --

     Grimacing, Max switches to a music station as DOCTOR NEIL GOLDMAN 
     (early 30's), bright and intense, falls in step.

                              NEIL
                         (absorbed in a clipboard
                          of patient's charts)
               Nothing like a little cheery news to start 
               the day.

                              MAX
               Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about
               all these suicides.

                              NEIL
               Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all
               the help we can get.

                              MAX
               Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about
               it.  Their parents all dropped acid in 
               the Sixties.

                              NEIL
               It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks
               it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock
               & roll.

                              MAX
               Shit, that's what keeps people alive.

     Max exits frame.  Neil continues on.  JENNIFER,  a girl of 14, 
     approaches.

                              NEIL
               Good morning, Jennifer.

                              JENNIFER
               Morning, Doctor Goldman.

                              NEIL
               How's your hand?

     She extends her hand for inspection -- it is scarred with 
     cigarette burns.  She points to three different welts.

                              JENNIFER
               Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

                              NEIL
               They're healing up nicely.

                              JENNIFER
               I've been good.  When do I get cigarette
               priveleges back?

                              NEIL
               Don't hold your breath.

     Jennifer shrugs.  It was worth a try.  She moves on.

     TARYN, a 17 year old blonde, approaches.  She appears exhausted, 
     dark tired circles under her eyes.

                              NEIL
               Hi Taryn.  You don't look so hot, kid.
               Been getting any sleep?

     She ignores him.  Neil watches her float past, then jots a note on 
     his clipboard.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               Didn't think so.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Neil comes to the Quiet Room and peers through the small mesh-grid 
     window.

     NEIL'S POV - (QUIET ROOM)

     KINCAID, an enormous and powerful-looking 17 year old with a 
     shaved head is huddled in the corner of the white padded room, 
     gazing at nothing.

     NEIL - (HALLWAY)

     makes a notation on his clipboard.  DOCTOR ELIZABETH SIMMS, the 
     hospital superior, appears at his elbow.

                              SIMMS
               How is he?

                              NEIL
               Cooling down.

                              SIMMS
               If he continues having these outbursts,
               I'll have to have him isolated permanently.

                              NEIL
               Don't worry, it won't come to that.

     They exit frome.  CAMERA PUSHES UP to teh mesh-grid window of the 
     Quiet Room for a shot of Kincaid.

     CLOSEUP - KINCAID - (QUIET ROOM)

     He stares into space, singing softly under his breath.

                              KINCAID
               I ain't gonna dream no more, no more,
               I ain't gonna dream no more.  All night
               long I sing this song, 'cause I ain't 
               gonna dream no more...

     DOLLYING WITH NEIL AND SIMMS - (HALLWAY)

                              NEIL
               I read the report on our new staff 
               member.

                              SIMMS
               What did you think?

                              NEIL
               Frankly, I don't understand why some
               grad school superstar is being treated
               like a seasoned pro.

                              SIMMS
               She's been doing ground-breaking
               research on pattern nightmares.

                              NEIL
               Elizabeth, we don't need any outside
               help.  I know these kids.  I don't 
               want some hot-shot taking chances 
               with them just so she can get published.

     Simms is about to say more, but is interrupted by:

                              P.A. VOICE
               Doctor Goldman to Examination, stat.

     They hurry down the hall.

     NURSES' STATION

     Kristen's mother, near hysteria, is loudly berating a NURSE.

                              ELAINE
               Don't give me that shit!  She's just 
               trying to get attention, that's all!
               I'm not playing her little game any-
               more!

     Neil and Simms rush past into the examination room.

     INT. EXAMINATION ROOM

     Neil and Simms burst into a chaotic struggle.  Kristen is going 
     berserk, fighting the STAFF as they try to restrain her and 
     wrestle her onto a gurney -- the gurney goes crashing into the 
     wall.  A frantic NURSE addresses Neil:

                              NURSE
               Suicide attempt.  They just brought her
               in from County General!

                              NEIL
               What's her name?

                              NURSE
               Kristen Parker.  She was fine until we
               tried to sedate her.

     Her face contorted with terror, Kristen kicks and bites and 
     scratches as ORDERLIES try to pin her.

                              ORDERLY
               Watch it!  She tore her stiches out!

                              NEIL
               Kristen, we want to help you!

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Max enters and takes immediate control.  he shoves everybody out 
     of the way, spins Kristen effortlessly around, and pins her arms 
     firmly from behind.  She tries to struggle, but he's too strong.  
     She weakens.

                              MAX
                         (compassionate)
               Calm down, baby sister, that's enough
               nonsense for now.

     Neil takes a hypo from the nurse and approaches Kristen slowly.

                              NEIL
               Kristen, I'm Doctor Goldman.  I'm not
               going to hurt you.  I'm just going to
               give you something to help you sleep.

     KRISTEN goes berserk again and kicks Neil in the stomach.  Max is 
     thrown off balance and crashes into a rolling cart -- medical 
     instruments shower to the floor.

     Kristen grabs a pair of wicked-looking surgical scissors.  She 
     slashes at max's hand, drawing blood.

                              NEIL
               Back off, Max!

     Kristen huddles into a corner, ready to skewer anybody who gets 
     close.  A tense stand-off.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               Kristen, put the scissors down!  No-
               body's gonna hurt you!

     But the girl makes no move to drop her guard.  She starts rocking 
     back and forth, coming apart at the seams, moaning a little song:

                              KRISTEN
               Five, six, grab your crucifix...
               seven, eight, better stay up late...
               nine, ten, never...never...

     She can't seem to find the words in her confused mind.

                              NANCY (O.S.)
               Never sleep again.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Instant silence in the room.  All eyes go to NANCY THOMPSON 
     standing in the doorway.  She's a young woman now, possessing 
     beauty and great inner strength.  her hair still bears the white 
     streak.  She speaks as if coming out of a trance:

                              NANCY
               Who taught you that rhyme?

     KRISTEN

     Her eyes are locked with Nancy's.

     NANCY

     The staff members part before her as she walks to Kristen.  She 
     takes the scissors from Kristen's hand.  Kristen falls into 
     Nancy's arms, sobbing.

     NEIL

     stares at Nancy in amazement.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY

     Neil and Nancy are finishing a late lunch in teh nearly deserted 
     cafeteria.

                              NANCY
               Tell me about the kids.

                              NEIL
               You'll get to meet them all tomorrow.
               They're...survivors.  In a way.  All
               severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia,
               narcolepsy, bedwetting...

                              NANCY
               But nightmares are the common thread?

                              NEIL
               Right.  They seem to share a group
               delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of
               a better word.  They're so traumatized,
               they'll do anything not to sleep.

                              NANCY
               Anything?

                              NEIL
                         (playing with his coffee)
               We lost a kid about a month ago to
               Fairview.  I don't know where he got
               the razor...but he cut off his own
               eyelids to stay awake.

                              NANCY
               Oh God.

                              NEIL
               Ever work with vets?
                         (Nancy shakes her head)
               These kids act like they've got
               D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome.
               If I didn't know better, I'd swear 
               they'd seen heavy combat.

                              NANCY
               I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.

                              NEIL
               What's that supposed to mean?

     She shrugs, not answering.  Neil lets it pass.

                              NEIL (cont.)
                         (changing the subject)
               By the way, that was great work with
               the new patient.  Pretty smooth for an
               intern.

                              NANCY
               I've had some experience with pattern
               nightmares.

                              NEIL
               So I've been told.  Practically an 
               obsession of your.

                              NANCY
               Call it a passion.
                         (glances at her watch)
               I've got to get going.

                              NEIL
               Make sure to check in with Max, he'll
               give you the 25 cent tour.

     She gathers her things.  Her purse falls over, scattering its 
     contents.  A bottle of pills rolls out.  Neil helps gather the 
     items -- he picks up the pills.

     INSERT - PILL BOTTLE

     The label reads: HYPNOCYL 60 mg.  1-2 TABS FOR SLEEP.

     BACK TO SCENE

     She takes the pills and stuffs them in her purse along with 
     everything else.

                              NANCY
               Thanks.  See you in the morning.

     She is almost out the door when Neil calls to her.

                              NEIL
               Ms. Thompson.

                              NANCY
               Call me Nancy.

                              NEIL
               Only if you call me Neil.  What was that
               nursery rhyme all about?

                              NANCY
               Just something children sing...to keep
               the boogeyman away.

     She exits.  Neil stares after her thoughtfully.

     HIS POV - LONG LENS OF THE CROWDED HALLWAY

     As Nancy turns and vanishes from sight, a NUN is a white habbit is 
     revealed at the far end of the hallway -- she seems to be staring 
     at him.  PEOPLE are wiping frame as they criss-cross the hallway, 
     affording mere glimpses of her.

     NEIL

     A bit slf-conscious.  Is the woman really staring at him?

     HIS POV - LONG LENS

     People keep wiping frame as they bustle in the hallway.  The nun 
     is now gone.

     NEIL

     frowns, puzzled.  he dismisses it and downs his last sip of 
     coffee.

                              NANCY
               A little basic, but nice.

                              MAX
               I'll have a file cabinet in there before
               tomorrow.
                         (leading her down a hall)
               The patient's rooms are down here.

     Nancy pauses at an open door, looking into:

     INT. PHILLIP'S ROOM

     PHILLIP, 16, sits at a work table fashioning the face of a 
     homemade marionette out of clay.  Other marionettes hang from the 
     wall. A comical dog, a white knight, a clown, etc.

                              MAX
                         (from doorway)
               This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.

                              NANCY
               Why is that?

                              PHILLIP

               event that our illustrious staff loves
               to theorize about endlessly.

                              MAX
               Phillip, this is Nancy.

                              PHILLIP
               Hi.  Welcome to the Snake Pit.

                              NANCY
               Thanks.
                         (admiring marionettes)
               Nice work.

               They really oughtta be carved out of 
               wood, but they won't let me have a
               knife.  I might, you know...

                              MAX
               That lump over there is Kincaid.

     Kincaid is lying on a bed, reading a comic book.

                              MAX (cont.)
               Take a close look.  He gets his ass
               thrown in the Quiet Room so often, 
               you probably won't see much of him.
               Right, Cool Breeze?

                              KINCAID
               I do it so I don't have to look at your
               face all the time.

     They exit frame.  PAN TO JOEY, a wan 16 year old watching them 
     from around the corner.  He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one 
     eye.

     A SOFT RYTHMIC SQUEAKING draws his attention.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     MARCIE, a cute 19 year old candy-striper, is wheeling a cart to a 
     laundry closet.

     As she begins to load the cart with clean towels, several fall to 
     the floor.  Joey hurries over.

     CLOSER ANGLE

     Joey picks up the towels and holds them out to Marcie.  She gives 
     him a bright smile.

                              MARCIE
               Why thank you, Joey.

     Joey grins mutely, obviously smitten.  LORENZO, a cocky, handsome 
     young orderly appears.

                              LORENZO
               Hey, Marcie.  These going to C Ward?

                              MARCIE
               Yeah.

                              LORENZO
               C'mon, I'll walk you down.

     They start down the hall, the cart still SQUEAKING RYTHMICALLY.  
     Marcie turns back, giving Joey a smile and a wave.

                              ELAINE
               Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've

     IN TIGHT on her face.  We hear the DISTANT, GHOSTLY JINGLING of a 
     tricycle bell.  Her eyes slowly open.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Kristen watches, terrified, as a tricycle rolls into the room by 
     itself, leaving bloody tire tracks.  The same tricycle that 
     belonged to the Little Girl.

     THE TRICYCLE

     comes to a stop...then begins to glow red-hot and melt, warping 
     and sagging as if from an astonishing inner heat.

     KRISTEN

     gets out of bed, edges past the ghastly melting apparition, and 
     backs out of the room.

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     As she backs out the door, we see it is the red Elm Street door.  
     She pauses, realizing something is terribly wrong -- suddenly the 
     door SLAMS SHUT INTO CAMERA.

     CAMERA ZOOMS OUT IN A DIZZYING RUSH to reveal the Elm Street 
     House.  Kristen is now trapped inside.

     INT. ELM STREET HOUSE

     Kristen tries to get out, but the door is locked.  She turns, 
     looking for another means of escape.  We hear a FAINT BUZZING.

     INT. DINING ROOM

     Kristen enters.  The BUZZING IS LOUDER.

     HER POV - THE DINNER TABLE

     The table is set for a formal dinner.  The grotesque, rotted 
     remains of a roast pig sits on a platter, covered with flies.

     KRISTEN

     is revolted.

     THE PIG

     leaps up, SQUEALING.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Kristen is suddenly pulled down, vanishing beneath the surface of 
     the liquid floor.  The furnishings remain, hanging in their own 
     gravity.

     UNDERWATER

     Kristen thrashes wildly in the the pitch-black water.  She swims 
     frantically, lungs bursting for air.  Impossible to tell which way 
     is up.

     HER POV

     A door hanging in watery limbo a short distance ahead.

     KRISTEN

     swims for it.

     THE DOOR

     She clutches the ornate handle and strains to open the door.

     INT. ROOM (OTHER SIDE OF TEH DOOR)

     The door swings open.  Kristen emerges from a solid wall of water 
     and steps into the room.  She is magically dry.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     It is the Elm Street living room, foreboding and nearly barren of 
     furniture.

     A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and 
     undulates toward her sinuously.  A long tubular shape.

     Kristen backs away.

     The shape circles her aimlessly, then slithers up the wall -- a 
     huge, writhing entity traveling within the wall surface.

     The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below 
     the floorline.

     Kristen turns about apprehensively, searching for the mysterious 
     entity.  Beat.

     Suddenly, the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath 
     her in a shower of wood splinters, engulfing her legs as it 
     rockets straight up.  It slams back down like a whale surfacing, 
     Kristen locked firmly in its jaws.

     THE CREATURE

     is a gigantic serpent/worm version of Freddy, ribbed and organic, 
     encrusted with mucous and slime.  Its slavering jaws dislocate 
     like a snake's, the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to 
     swallow Kristen from the legs up.

                              KRISTEN
                         (screaming)
               NANCY!

     INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     E.C.U. Nancy dozing.  Her eyes flutter open as she hears a FAINT 
     REVERBERATION of Kristen's call.

     LOW ANGLE

     Nancy strains to listen -- all is silent now.  uneasy, she rises 
     from her chair...but freezes in place as she hears the UNEARTHLY 
     CALL again, brely discernable.  She turns.

     THE ELM STREET HOUSE MODEL

     The sound seems to emanate from the strange paper mache dollhouse.  
     CAMERA RUSHES IN TIGHT as its tiny front door swings slowly open.

     NANCY

     DOLLYING IN TIGHT ON HER FACE as she puts a hand to her head, a 
     feeling of dizziness suddenly washing over her.

     WIDER

     She sinks back into her chair -- and keeps right on going, 
     impossibly sucked away into the thin chair.  She is gone in the 
     blink of an eye.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     A large ornate oval mirror hangs on the wall.  The glass EXPLODES 
     as Nancy bursts into the room.

     She rises, staring in horror and disbelief.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     The horrid Freddy/snake expands and contracts around Kristen, 
     slowly wolfing her down, its awful diseased maw inching up past 
     her waist.

                              KRISTEN
               NANCY!

     NANCY

     snaps into action.  She scoops up a long jagged shard of broken 
     mirror, cutting her palm in the process.

     She leaps into the fray, jamming the shard of glass into 
     Freddy/snake's eye -- the eye bursts, spraying rancid ichor.

     FREDDY/SNAKE

     Regurgitating Kristen, the creature arcs back, ready to strike.  
     his good eye locks on Nancy, recognizing his old enemy.

                              FREDDY/SNAKE
                         (total rage)
               YOU!

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY/SNAKE

     ROARS as the snake face peels back like old parchment and 
     instantly transforms into a mind blowing skull/snake/Freddy with 
     horns and double rows of razor teeth -- striking INTO CAMERA.

     NANCY

     grabs Kristen and barrel-rolls out of the way.  They scramble out 
     the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (OTHER SIDE OF DOOR)

     Nancy slams the door and fumbles with the lock, snapping it into 
     place.

                              NANCY
               You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?

                              KRISTEN
               I -- I think so!

     The razor-teeth burst through the door, splintering it.

                              NANCY
               Then get us back out!

     Kristen tries to concentrate -- the teeth tear a chunk from the 
     door and the Freddy/beast's drooling snout lunges through.  
     Chewing.  Tearing.

                              NANCY (cont.)
               NOW, KRISTEN!  DO IT NOW!

                              KRISTEN
                         (muttering, pleading)
               Wake up , wake up, wake up --

     The door EXPLODES in on them as we

     INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     nancy thrashes awake in her reading chair, knocking a cup of 
     coffee across them room.  She is shaking in the aftermath of 
     terror, her fists clenched tight, not knowing if she just dreamed 
     it all or not.

     Suddenly realizing, she unclenches her hand -- the palm is cut 
     from the shard of broken mirror she plunged into Freddy/snake's 
     eye.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

     Nancy bursts in with the Elm Street House model under her arm and 
     hurries down the hallway -- right past Neil.

                              NEIL
               You're late.

                              NANCY
               Didn't get much sleep.

                              NEIL
               Well, we've got --

     But she's already turned the corner and gone.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Nancy rushes up to Kristen's room and looks in.  Empty.  Max 
     appears, coming up the hall.

                              NANCY
               Max, where's Kristen?

                              MAX
               She's been waiting outside your office
               since breakfast.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - (NANCY'S OFFICE HALL)

     Nancy rushes around the corner and stops.  Kristen is sitting 
     patiently in the hallway outside Nancy's office.  She stands.

                              NANCY
                         (holds up Elm Street model)
               I used to live in this house.

                              KRISTEN
               But...it's just a house I've dreamed 
               about.
                         (lower)
               I dream about it all the time.
                         (pause)
               Thank you for what you did last night.

     INT. NANCY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Nancy and Kristen speak in low tones with the door closed.

                              NANCY
               Have you ever done that before?  Pulled
               someone into your dream?

                              KRISTEN
                         (dreamy, far-away look)
               When I was a little girl.  Three or four.
               If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in.
               The dream would always get better.
                         (smiles)
               He always used to tell me about it the 
               next day -- he used to think they were
               his dreams.
                              NANCY
               When did it stop?

                              KRISTEN
               When I was still a kid.  My folks got
               divorced.
                         (beat)
               After a while, I thought I'd imagined
               the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.

                              NANCY
               It's an amazing gift.

     Pause.  Then, softly:

                              KRISTEN
               That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't
               he?

                              NANCY
               He's real.

     INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

     All the kids of the Adolescent Care Unit are gathered:  Kincaid, 
     Phillip, Taryn, Joey, Jennifer, and WILL, a 17 year old confined 
     to an electric wheelchair.  Kristen's a bit uncomfortable -- she's 
     the new kid.  The general impression is of a blitzed-out squad 
     just out of heavy combat.  Nancy takes of a blitzed-out squad just 
     out of heavy combat.  Nancy takes her place next to Elizabeth 
     Simms as Neil closes the door.

               Okay, Group's in session.  Straight 
               talk only in this room.

                              SIMMS
               Today I'd like to start by getting us
               acquainted with our new staff member,
               Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel 
               welcome.

     The kids murmur a chorus of AD-LIBBED GREETINGS.

                              NEIL
               Let's see, you've already met Phillip, 
               Kincaid, and Kristen.  Why don't the 
               rest of you tell Nancy something about
               yourselves?

     neil absently toys with the row of hanging metal balls on one of 
     those click-clack kinetic toys sitting on the table.  No 
     volunteers.

               Will?  How about you first?

               I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a
               little accident, as you can see.

                              TARYN
               Accident my ass.  I thought this was
               supposed to be straight talk in here.

                              KINCAID
               Hey, so he took a jump.  At least he
               wasn't sticking needles in his arms
               with a bunch of lowlifes.

                              SIMMS
               Save it, Kincaid.  Jennifer?

                              JENNIFER
               I'm Jennifer Caulfield.  When I get
               out of here I'm going to L.A. to be 
               an actress.  i'm gonna be on T.V.

                              KINCAID
               Yeah.  Lifestyles of the Rich and
               Psychotic.

               Screw you.
                         (indicates Joey)
               This is Joey.  He used to be a debater
               in school, but now he doesn't talk much.

     Joey grins at Nancy shyly, nodding his head in greeting.

                              TARYN
               I'm Taryn White.  I only came here
               because it was a better deal than 
               juvie hall.
                         (pause)
               Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through
               some very stange shit.

                              NANCY
               Your dreams?

                         (softly)
               Hey, everybody has bad dreams.

                              PHILLIP
               Can I interject something here?  Just
               to save us all some time?

                              NEIL
               Go ahead, Phillip.

                              PHILLIP
                         (to Nancy)
               According to our kind hosts, our dreams
               are a group psychosis.  Sort of a mellow
               mass hysteria.  The fact that we all 
               dreamt about this guy before we ever
               met doesn't seem to impress anybody.

     The kids murmur in agreement.

                              PHILLIP (cont.)
               So we go in circles making minimal
               progress with maximum effort.

                              SIMMS
               And you won't make any progress until
               you can recognize your dreams for what
               they are.

                              NANCY
               And what are they?

                              SIMMS
               The by-product of guilt.  Psychological
               scars steaming from moral conflicts and
               overt sexuality.

                              KINCAID
               Great.  Now it's my dick that's killing
               me.

                              KRISTEN
               Tell them, Nancy.  Tell them what's 
               really going on.

                              NEIL
                         (surprised)
               Yes, tell us, Nancy.

                              NANCY
               All I can say is this isn't something
               that's just going to disappear.  you're
               all going to have to face it.  Fight it.
               And if you're willing to work together...
               wiling to stand up to your deepest
               fears...I think we can beat it.

     PANNING THE KIDS

     Their expressions reflect a quiet mix of hope and fear.  They are 
     impressed -- all except Kincaid.

                              KINCAID
               My deepest fear is listening to any more
               of this rah-rah bullshit.

     Will sits in his wheelchair with his Dungeons and Dragons game 
     spread out on the table before him.  Taryn's not really into it,

     with rapt attention.  Taryn throws the dice.

     Will refers to his Dungeonmaster's card.

               Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon.
               Go ahead.

               I go to bed and get a new horse in the
               morning.

     She exits.  Will turns to Joey.

                              WILL
               How do I score that?  Enchanted slumber
               or Death?

     Joey makes a throat-cutting motion.  Max enters.

                              MAX
               Gentlemen.  It's lights out.

                              WILL
               Aw, Max...

                              MAX
               You know the rules.

                              WILL
               Okay, okay.

     Max lifts Will gently out of his wheelchair and lays him on his 
     bed.

                              MAX
               You too, Joey.
                         (Joey scrambles into bed)
               'Night, boys.

     Max turns out the lights and exits, closing the door.  Beat.

                              WILL
               You get the first shift tonight.

     Joey throws back the covers and sits up.  He shakes his head and 
     points, indicating that it's Will's turn.

                              WILL (cont.)
               Come on, I had it last night.
                         (Joey shrugs, giving in)
               Okay, just keep your eyes open.  One 
               whimper and you wake me up.

     Joey nods.

     INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Neil and Nancy having a quiet dinner.

               Must have opened while I was away at 
               school.

                              NEIL
               Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood,
               which isn't saying much.
                         (beat)
               your parents still live around here?

                              NANCY
               My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.

                              NEIL
               Sorry.

                              NANCY
               My father an I...well, the family just
               seemed to fall apart.

                              NEIL
               Sounds like a rough time.

                              NANCY
               It was.
                         (beat)
               Neil, do you believe in other realities?

                              NEIL
               I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?

                              NANCY
               I'm serious.

                              NEIL
               Okay...I believe in different levels of
               conciousness, that sort of thing...but
               if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've
               lost me.

                              NANCY
               What if I told you your patients are in
               real physical danger from their dreams?

                              NEIL
               That's a new one.  Is that what they're
               teaching now at Stanford?

                              NANCY
               That's what I know.

                              NEIL
               The nightmares are nothing but a symptom
               of their real problems.

                              NANCY
               All right.  Then let's eliminate the 
               symptom for the time being.

                              NEIL
               With Hypnocyl?

                              NANCY
               That's right.

                              NEIL
               You want me to prescribe an experimental
               psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal
               teenagers?

                              NANCY
               Just until we get things under control.

                              NEIL
                         (shakes his head)
               Dream deprivation is nothing to fool 
               around with.  you have no business 
               taking it yourself.

                              NANCY
               I used to be like them, Neil.  I know
               what they're going through.

                              NEIL
               So do I.

                              NANCY
               Do you?
                         (beat)
               You told me they're survivors...and they
               are.  But how much longer they survive
               is up to us.

                              NEIL
               I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.

     INT. PHILLIP AND KINCAID'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Phillip and Kincaid lie sleeping in their beds.  DOLLY SLOWLY IN 
     on Phillip.  He moans softly -- perhaps a troubled dream.

     BOOM UP TO the marionettes hanging on the wall.  An eerie 
     collection of moonlit figures.

     DOLLY IN FOR CLOSEUP on the unfinished marionette.  It raises its 
     gray, misshapen head.

     The crude clay features ripple and change into a distinct likeness 
     of Freddy.

     CLOSEUP - MARIONETTE'S HAND

     Sharp razor-claws generate from the stubby clay fingers.

     FREDDY/MARIONETTE

     swipes his claws at his strings, cutting himself loose.

     THE FLOOR

     Freddy/marionette lands in a cat-like crouch.  As he straightens 
     up, he starts to grow.

     PHILLIP

     stirs...his eyes open.

     PHILLIP'S POV

     Freddy/marionette rises into view at teh foot of the bed...growing 
     into the full-sized Freddy.

     PHILLIP

     opens his mouth to scream.

     FREDDY

     holds a finger to his lips, signaling for silence.

     PHILLIP

     gasps for breath, suddenly paralyzed.  His blanket is magically 
     snapped off the bed.

     FREDDY

     flicking downward with a single blade, quickly, precisely.  Again 
     and again.

     CLOSEUP - PHILLIP

     in excruciating pain, unable to move a muscle.

     HIGH ANGLE

     Looking down at Phillip.  Clean, nearly bloodless incisions have 
     been made down the length of each arm and leg.

     CLOSER

     one long strand of sinewy muscle tissue leaps up  out of each 
     incision.

     PHILLIP

     His muscle/strings go taut -- he's lifted from his bed.

     KINCAID

     Stirs awake and sees:

     KINCAID'S POV

     Phillip is walking out of the room, apparently sleepwalking.

                              KINCAID
                         (groggy)
               Hey Phillip.  Wake up, man.

     No response.

     FAVORING PHILLIP

     His terrified eyes are bulging as he leaves the room, being 
     manipulated at the end of his strings like a marionette.

     In the background, Kincaid rolls over.

                              KINCAID
                         (grumbling)
               Have a nice stroll, asshole.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Phillip is "puppeted" slowly down the hallway.  Tears roll down 
     his checks as he rolls his eyes wildly, looking for a way out of 
     this nightmare.  No use.  He has no control over his movements.

     NURSE'S STATION

     A NIGHT NURSE is dioing paperwork at her station.  Nearby, a 
     JANITOR mops the floor.

     Neither of them notice Phillip as he sleepwalks past in the 
     background.

     PHILLIP/MARIONETTE

     The moment he is out of thei view, he walks into a wall...and 
     dissolves right through it.  So much for hospital security.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. WILL AND JOEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Joey is sitting by the windwo in the dark, wide awake.  Passing 
     time.  A movement catches his eye, he glances out the window.

     JOEY'S POV - THE BELL TOWER

     It stands stories above the rest of the massive, rambling 
     hospital, the apex of all teh wings of the building.  TILT UP to 
     the archway at the top of the belltower.  The small, pale figure 
     of Phillip stands on teh ledge.

     JOEY

     staring in horror, his mouth opening and closing as he tries to 
     call for help.

     EXT. BELLTOWER LEDGE

     Weeping with terror, Phillip teeters at teh lip of the ledge over 
     an awesome, dizzying drop -- the courtyard is far below.

     The strings jerk Phillip forward and back, toying with him.

     INT. WILL AND JOEY'S ROOM

     Frantic, Joey turns from the windwo and drags Will out of his bed.  
     Will is groggy, disoriented.

                              WILL
               Are you crazy?  What are you doing?

     Joey drags Will across teh floor to the window, pointing.

     JOEY AND WILL

     Will sees Phillip on the bell tower.

                              WILL
                         (cold dread)
               Oh shit.  Get help.

     Joey races from the room as Will starts pounding the window.

                              WILL (cont.)
               PHILLIP!  PHILLIP!

     INT. HALLWAY

     Joey runs to the Nurse at her station, gesturing in panic.  He 
     hops around frantically, motioning for her to come.

                              NURSE
                         (doesn't understand)
               Joey, what's the matter?

     He freaks out and grabs a metal tray off the counter.  The nurse's 
     dinner goes flying.  Joey runs down the hall, slamming the tray 
     against the walls.

     The kids appear from their rooms in a state of confusion.  Staff 
     members come running.

     INT. WILL AND JOEY'S ROOM

     Will is still pounding the window, hollering.  Joey runs in, the 
     others pour in after him.

                              WILL
               PHILLIP!  WAKE UP!

     EXT. LEDGE

     Phillip teeters on the edge.  He looks up, eyes pleading and wet 
     with tears.

     PHILLIP'S POV

     A giant transparent Freddy, seen from the waist up, looms in the 
     night sky, higher than thebell tower.  he is leaning over the 
     building from behind as if it were a marionette stage, laughing 
     maniacally as he puppets Phillip.

     Freddy draws back his claw hand -- then slashes out, slicing 
     Phillip's strings.

     PHILLIP

     The puppet spell is broken -- he SCREAMS, arms windmilling 
     frantically as he falls from teh ledge.

     LOW ANGLE

     Phillip plummets from the tower.

     THE KIDS AT THE WINDOW

     There is a horrible THUMP as Phillip impacts.  Some kids are 
     SCREAMING, some are crying, all horrified beyond words.  The staff 
     members are helpless as bedlam reigns.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

     Group is in session.  The kids seem sullen, fragile, 
     disconnected...without hope.  Neil looks beaten-down, less self-
     assured than usual -- Phillip's death has shaken him.

                              NEIL
               I want to talk about what happened last
               night.  Let's get all our feelings out
               in the open.

     The kids hold silent for a long moment, then Kincaid offers a 
     grudging appraisal.

                              KINCAID
               He wasn't strong enough.  So he got 
               wasted, that's all.

                              JENNIFER
               That's all?  Is that what you think?

                              KINCAID
               He couldn't hack it and he got nailed.
               Period.

                         (contmpt)
               Oh yeah, big tough badass.  How long 
               you gonna last?

                              KINCAID
               Longer than any of you.

                              KRISTEN
                         (softly)
               Go ahead and fight.  That's what he 
               wants.

                              WILL
               Who?

                              JENNIFER
               You know who.
                         (to Kristen)
               What does he want?

                              KRISTEN
               To turn us against each other...so we'll
               be weak.  Easy prey.

                              KINCAID
               Horseshit.

                              NANCY
               No, she's right.

     All eyes go to Nancy.  Simms shoots her a dirty look.

                              SIMMS
               I think we're all missing the point 
               here.  Phillip's death was a sleepwalking
               accident.  Nothing more.

                              WILL
                         (softly)
               I could see him up there.  His face.
               He was wide awake...all the way down.

                              NEIL
               Then it was suicide.  Phillip quit.  He
               copped out.

     Joey shakes his head, getting agitated.

                              JENNIFER
               Joey says it wasn't no suicide.

     Neil lets some of his anger and frustration show through:

                              NEIL
               Joey, listen to me!  Phillip killed 
               himself.  And that's a cowardly thing.
               An empty thing.  he let himself down.
               he let all of us down.

     Joey is blinking back tears.

                              TARYN
               It was murder!  Can't you understand
               that?  That bastard murdered him!

                              JENNIFER
                         (spooked)
               You never know when he's going to come.
               Sometimes for days, nothing...then --

                              SIMMS
               I've heard quite enough of this.  How
               long before you're ready to face your-
               selves?  How much longer can you keep
               blaming your dreams for your own 
               weaknesses?

                              KINCAID
               How much longer you gonna blow smoke up
               our ass?

                              NEIL
               That's enough, Kincaid.

                              SIMMS
               There will be no repeat occurences of
               last night's events.  From now on, your
               doors will be locked during sleeping 
               hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening
               sedation.  For everybody.

     A terrified reaction from the group.  Nancy shoots Neil a sharp 
     look, shaking her head.

                              KINCAID
                         (rising)
               The fuck you will.  Anybody tries to
               drug me gets his ass kicked!

                              SIMMS
                         (rising, angry)
               You just bought yourself a night in the
               Quiet Room, mister.  Now sit down!

                              KINCAID
                         (shouting)
               Fuck you!  You sit down!

     Simms presses a button, summoning help.  Neil rises, prepared to 
     protect Simms if necessary.

                              NEIL
               Easy, Kincaid...

     Max and another ORDERLY enter.  Kincaid starts to freak.  he kicks 
     a chair at them, screaming!

                              KINCAID
               NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!

     The orderlies get Kincaid into an armlock and wrestle him, 
     fighting and kicking, out the door.

     Simms follows the struggle out into the hallway.  Neil and Nancy 
     join her.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Simms, flushed and livid, watches Kincaid get dragged away.  She 
     turns to Neil.

                              SIMMS
               We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting
               with him.

                              NANCY
               You can't!  They'll be defenseless against
               their dreams.

                              SIMMS
               That's precisely what they need.  Some
               uninterrupted REM sleep to release all
               this negative energy.

                              NANCY
                         (to Neil, desperate)
               Neil, please --

     Neil pauses, wavering between nancy and Simms.  He finally comes 
     to a decision:

                              NEIL
               Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.
                         (she gives him a 
                          blank stare)
               It's a dream suppressant.

                              SIMMS
               I know what it is.  I just can't believe
               what I'm hearing.
                         (indicates Nancy)
               What has she talked you into?

                              NEIL
               Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's 
               my decision.  I want the dreams stopped
               until we get some answers.

                              SIMMS
               I won't allow it.

                              NEIL
               I'll go straight to Carver if I have
               to.  He'll either back me up or accept
               my resignation.

     Simms pauses, then:

                              SIMMS
               If soemthing goes wrong, I'll make sure
               you're held responsible.  Fully responsible.

     Simms exits.  Neil watches her go.

                              NEIL
               I can't believe I just did that.

                              NANCY
               Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in
               by tomorrow?

                              NEIL
               We're gonna try.

     He turns and walks away -- but pauses, looking back.

                              NEIL
               I hope you know what you're getting us
               into.

               Restless.  Very restless.

     Kristen appears at her door, looking sleepy and exhausted.

                              KRISTEN
               Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?

     Taryn, wearing robe and slippers, emerges from the women's 
     bathroom and shuffles back toward her room.

     Lorenzo, the young orderly, appears in her path, twirling a 
     keyring.

                              LORENZO
               Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.

                              TARYN

                          to get past him)
               Can't be good news coming from you.

                              LORENZO
               Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.

                              TARYN

                              TARYN
               What?

                              LORENZO
               The dispensary.  I'm talking clean
               pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club

     He grabs her wrist, exposing her arm -- her skin is scarred with 
     old needle tracks.

                              LORENZO
               What are these, beauty marks?

                              TARYN

               Those are ancient history.

               Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the
               mood for a history lesson, I'm your

               Stay out of my face or I'll go straight

               the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not
               after Phillip.

     Max hesitates...then relents against his better judgement.

     Max exits, shaking his head.  Jennifer turns back to the TV -- the 
     Late Show drones on.  She shakes herself, still fighting to stay 
     awake.

     She digs a hidden pack of cigarettes from under the chair cushion 
     and lights up.  She takes a deep drag -- then, wincing with pain, 
     burns her hand with the lit cigarette.  Anything to stay awake.

               We're not always as good at things as
               we'd like.

               Yeah, but I was really not good.

     They laugh softly.

               Yeah, but I was really not good.

               I'm glad you're here.

     Nancy pauses, wrestling with a decision.  She digs into her purse, 
     pulls out her bottle of Hypnocyl, and shakes the contents into her 
     hand.  Just two pills left.  She gives them to Kristen.

               Well, I suppose it --

     The image sputters with snowy interference.

     Her eyes fluttering.

     Alternating between snow and image.

               -- find a good teacher.  An actor has 
               to study, to learn.  I think that's
               crucial.

     TEH TV SCREEN

     Nothing now but static.

     JENNIFER

     Frowning.  Must have imagined it.  She rises and smacks the side 
     of the set, trying to get the picture back.  Nothing.

     Suddenly, two arms rip from each side of the TV set and grab her 
     by the shoulders.  The arms are a horrid hybrid of Freddy's arms 
     and RCA tubes and wiring.  She SCREAMS as she is lifted off the 
     ground.

     TV SET

     Freddy's head grows and stretches out of the top of the set, 
     wearing the rabbit-ear antenna like some horrible insect.  
     Jennifer keeps SCREAMING.

                              FREDDY
               This is it, Jennifer!  Your big break
               in TV!

     he rams her head into the screen with hideously brutal force -- 
     there is an EXPLOSION of glass and electrical sparks.

     A midwestern cemetary on a rolling hillside.  A gentle drizzle 
     falls on a crowd of mourners clustered at twin gravesites.  A 
     PRIEST intones the eulogy.  Among the mourners are Dr. Simms, Max, 
     Nancy...but Neil is missing.

     CLOSER - MAX AND NANCY

     Staring as the caskets are lowered.

     MASTER - THE FUNERAL

     CAMERA BOOMS BACK to reveal Neil standing on a rise overlooking 
     the funeral.  he's under the shelter of a large oak tree, but is 
     still soaked by the drizzle.  He stares down, grief-stricken, his 
     tears masked by rain.

                              NUN (O.S.)
               Don't be ashamed, young man.  This is
               a place for sorrow.

     ANTOHER ANGLE

     The nun in white stands clsoe by (Neil saw her in the hospital 
     hallway).  She appears in her 60's, but carries herself with a 
     strength that belies her years.  Neil wipes his eyes.

                              NUN (cont.)
               What faith do you follow?

     He chokes back a bitter laugh.

                              NUN

               I come from time to time.  When I'm
               needed.

     Neil turns his gaze back toward the funeral, lost in his own 
     private grief.

                              NEIL
                         (softly)
               I could've saved them.

                              NUN
               Only one thing can save the children.
               The unquiet spirit must be laid to 
               rest.  It is an abomination to God and
               Man.

               Neil?

     Neil turns and moves to the edge of the rise as Nancy crests the 
     hill.  The services have ended, the crowd is dispersing.

               C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.

     As they head slowly down the hill, PAN TO THE NUN IN CLOSEUP -- 
     she is fingering a rosary and whispering a prayer as she watches 
     them go.

     quietly, almost as if to himself.

                              NEIL
               I used to think I could do something
               about it...make some kind of difference
               ...but they keep slipping through my 
               fingers.

     He raises a nearly empty wineglass and drains the last sip.

     WIDER ANGLE

     The remains of a Chinese takeout dinner is spread on the floor.  
     Nancy is crouched near the fireplace, feeding paper cartons to the 
     flames.

                              NANCY
               Stop blaming yourself.

                              NEIL
               I'm running out of answers. A patient
               sleepwalks out of a security ward up
               to a tower with no access.  A girl, 
               alone in a room, dies by jumping six
               feet straight up into a television set.
               Nothing makes sense anymore.

                              NANCY
               Then maybe you're ready.

                              NEIL
               For what?

                              NANCY
               The truth.

                              NEIL
               Try me.

                              NANCY
                         (considers it)
               Only if you're willing to put aside 
               everything you've learned and trust me.
               Can you do that?

                              NEIL
                         (pause)
               I can do that.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

     nancy closes the door and faces the remaining kids:  Kristen, 
     Kincaid, Will, Taryn, and Joey.  Neil sits by with a clipboard on 
     his knee.  Dr. Simms is conspicuously absent.

                              NEIL
               Okay.  Straigh talk only in here.

                              TARYN
               Is this Group?

                              NEIL
               Well, unofficially.

                              WILL
               Pretty soon there won't be enough of us
               left to call it "Group."

                              NEIL
               Listen up.  Nancy's got something to say.

                              NANCY
                         (pause)
               I know who's trying to kill you.

                              KINCAID
               Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in 
               the mood.

                              NANCY
               He wears a dirty brown hat.
                         (this gets their attention)
               He's horribly burned.
                         (all eyes on her)
               He has razors on his right hand.

                              TARYN
               Who is he?

                              NANCY
               Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer
               before he died.  After he died, he became
               ...something worse.
                         (beat)
               Six years ago Freddy killed my friends.
               He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid
               of him -- but I guess he was too strong.

     Thick silence.  The kids stare at her, flabbergasted, not knowing 
     whether to believe or doubt.  Then:

                              WILL
               Why is he after us?

                              TARYN
               Yeah?  What did we ever do?

                              NANCY
               Not what you did.  Your parents.  My 
               parents.  They burned him alive.
               We're paying for their sins.
                         (softly)
               You're the last of the Elm Street
               children.

     FAVORING THE KIDS

     as they react with bewilderment.

                              WILL
                         (can't grasp it)
               Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They     
               never said...

                              TARYN
               Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing
               parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight
               honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers.
               Oh, by the way, your father and I torched
               some maniac last night."

                              KINCAID
               So what do we do about this creep?

                              NANCY
               Last time, it was me against him.  I
               wasn't strong enough...alone.

                              WILL
                         (catching the thread)
               But together...

                              NANCY
               Kristen's the key.  She's got a very
               special talent.  A gift.

                              KRISTEN
               I haven't been able to do that since
               I was a little girl.

                              NANCY
               You did it the other night.

                              KRISTEN
               That was different.

                              NANCY
               You never lose a gift like that.  You
               just forget how to use it.
                         (beat)
               How about it?  Will you try?

     Kristen nods.

                              NANCY (cont.)
               Each one of you has an inner strength --
               some special power you've had in your
               most wonderful dreams.  Together we 
               can learn to use those powers...if we
               try.

                              NEIL
                         (muttering to Nancy)
               You sound like Peter Pan.

                              NANCY
               Remember -- open mind.

                              NEIL
                         (dimming the lights)
               Okay, we're going to try a little group
               hypnosis.

     He turns to a high-tech chrome pendulum device sitting on the 
     tabletop and flicks a switch.  The pendulum rocks slowly from side 
     to side as a tiny blip of high intensity light flashes 
     intermittently.  Everybody stares at the device.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               I want you all to follow the pendulum
               with your eyes.  Tune out everything 
               else...nothing else exists but the 
               pendulum.

                              NANCY
                         (softly)
               Take us there, Kristen.

                              NEIL
               Breathe deeply and relax...starting with
               your toes, relax everything until there's 
               no tension left in your bodies.  None at
               all.  Keep following the pendulum...

     PANNING THE KIDS

     as they stare at the device, becoming mesmerized.

                              NEIL (cont. O.S.)
               You find yourselves getting tired. 
               Nothing wuld feel better right now than
               a nice, long, deep sleep.

     ENDFRAME on Kristen.  Eyes fluttering closed.

                              NEIL (cont. O.S.)
               I'm going to count backwards from five,
               and when I finish, you will all be 
               asleep.

     NANCY

     watching the pendulum, lulled under its spell.

                              NEIL (cont. O.S.)
               Five...four...three...

     NEIL

     staring at the device, counting down.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               ...two...one.

     KRISTEN

     Her eyes snap open, she looks up.

     WIDER

     Everyone looks up.  The room is stil teh same, nothing has 
     changed.  neil switches the device off.

                              KRISTEN
               I'm sorry.

     Everybody reacts, disappointed.

                              NANCY
               We can try again.

                              NEIL
               Everybody take five.

     Several kids stand up to stretch their legs.  Neil turns to Nancy, 
     drawing her aside.

                              NEIL
               Look, I was willing to go along with this
               for the kids' peace of mind...and yours. 
               But you've got to face reality...

     JOEY

     He is at the water cooler getting a drink.  He pauses, hearing the 
     RYTHMIC SQUEAKING OF A CART.

     HIS POV

     Marcie, the cute candy-striper, appears just outside the door with 
     her cart.  She sees him and stops.

     JOEY

     gives her a goofy grin, totally in love.

     MARCIE

     looks arund to see if anybody is watching -- then smiles and 
     gestures to him.

     JOEY

     He glances around, then slips out the door unnoticed.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Marcie checks again to make sure nobody is watching, then motions 
     for Joey to follow her.

     JOEY

     hurries after her, his knees going weak.

     INT - GROUP THERAPY ROOM

     The kids are still taking a break.  neil is absently-mindedly 
     toying with the metal click-clack balls.

                              NANCY
               Neil, let's try one more time.  If
               it doesn't work, then I promise --

     neil raises the end ball and sends it into the others -- instead 
     of click-clacking, they simply float apart into mid-air.

     nancy gapes as the metal balls float past her head.

     All activity comes to a standstill.  Everybody stares.

                              WILL
                         (realizing)
               We're here.

                              TARYN
               Where...here?

                              KRISTEN
               Yes.  We're in the dream.

     NEIL

     Staring at the balls, rapt and fascinated.

                              NEIL
               Don't be silly...we're in Group...

                              WILL (O.S.)
               In my dreams, I can walk.  My legs are
               strong.

     THE GROUP

     They all turn to see Will standing straight and tall.  No sign of 
     his wheelchair.

                              WILL (cont.)
               In my dreams, I'm the Dungeonmaster.

     He plucks a metal ball from teh air, holds it in his fist, and      
     blows in one end -- a fantasy dragonfly appears out the other.

     NANCY AND NEIL

                              NANCY
               We made it.  Neil, we made it!

                              NEIL
                         (ducking the dragonfly)
               This isn't possible.
                         (beat)
               And even if it is...what the hell am
               I doing here?
                         (to Kristen)
               Did you drag me in here too?

     Kristen grins sheepishly.

                              NANCY
               Try soemthing, Kristen.  What can you
               do in your dreams?

     Kristen take s afew steps back, then launches herself into a 
     perfectly executed series of twisting handflips across the room.

                              WILL
               A perfct score!  The crowd goes wild!

     Kincaid picks up a metal chair and twists it open like a paperclip 
     with his bare hands.

                              KINCAID
               Fuckin' A.  Dig this.

                              NEIL
               Kincaid, please.  That's very unnerving.

                              KINCAID
               Hey, check out Taryn.

     TARYN

     She's become a brethtaking street punk, like something out of a 
     rock fantasy:  shimmering platinum hair swept back in a wild 
     Mohawk, and sleep black leathers with delicate silver chains.

                              TARYN
               In my dreams, I'm beautiful --

     She flicks out a wicked gravity knife and twirls it open faster 
     than the eye can follow.

                              TARYN (cont.)
               -- and bad.

     NANCY AND NEIL

     Neil looking around, still trying to grasp it.

                              NANCY
               Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream.
               Anything is possible.

                              NEIL
               Anything?

     Nancy nods.

     CLOSEUP - NEIL

     He closes his eys and concentrates, trying an experiment.  He 
     opens his eyes and sees:

     NANCY

     Now wearing a frilly negligee.

                              NANCY
               Very funny.

     The kids laugh and hoot.  neil blushes, very flustered.

                              KINCAID
               Nice dreaming, Doc.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. DORM ROOM

     It is an unoccupied dorm room.  Marcie leads Joey in.  She closes 
     the door softly, then turns to him.

                              MARCIE
               Listen, Joey...I just wanted to get you
               alone for a second.  i mean...
                         (beat)
               Look, I really like you.

     She steps closer.  Joey gulps.

                              MARCIE (cont.)
               Do you like me?
                         (Joey nods)
               This may sound crazy, but...I make up
               excuses to come into the ward every
               day just to see you.  you're so cute.

     Joey's eyes widen.  She sits him on the bed and stands in front of 
     him.

                              MARCIE (cont.)
               I could get into a lot of trouble for
               this, but I know you won't say anything.
               Will you?

     Joey shakes his head violently.  She turns her back to him.

                              MARCIE (cont.)
               Unzip me.

     Joey reaches up and unzips her with shaking hands.

     She turns back and shrugs off ehr uniform.  She is wearing only 
     skimpy panties.  She is magnificent.

                              MARCIE
                         (coy smile)
               Do you like my body, Joey?

     Joey is overwhelmed.

     Marcie pushes Joey gently back on the bed and crawls on top of him 
     with sinewy grace.  SHe starts unbuttoning his shirt and kissing 
     his chest.

     CLOSER

     Marcie kisses his mouth, her tongue probing deeply.

     Too deeply.  Joey gags and draws back -- but Marcie's tongue grows 
     supernaturally long and burrows deeper into his mouth.

     CLOSEUP - JOEY

     Choking.  he grabs the writhing tongue and tries to pull it out of 
     his mouth.

     CLOSEUP - MARCI

     The tail end of her tongue leaps out of her mouth with a life of 
     its own.

     ON JOEY

     Both ens of the tongue/creature whip around his wrist and yank it 
     back, twining around the bedpost like a bullwhip.

     MARCIE

     A second hideously long tongue shoots out of her mouth, throught 
     the air --

     JOEY

     -- and lashes his other arm to the other bedpost with a THWACK!  
     Freddy's maniacal LAUGHTER rings out.  joey looks up.

     JOEY'S POV

     Marcie's head has been replaced by Freddy's -- his grotesque 
     laughing face perched atop her lovely body.

                              FREDDY/MARCIE
                         (gleefully)
               What's wrong, Joey?  I thought you liked
               my body!

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY

     Two more tongues fly from his mouth simultaneously.

     JOEY'S FEET

     are lashed to the footboard bedposts.

     HIGH ANGLE

     Looking directly down on Joey writhing on the bed.  The mattress 
     drops away beneath him, descending a shaft exactly it's size.  The 
     mattress is engulfed in a fiery inferno below.  CRANE UP as Joey 
     is left suspended over a hellish pit of flame, trying desperately 
     to scream.

     INT. GROUP THERAPY

     The lights suddenly dim and flicker out.  Everybody comes to a 
     standstill, looking around apprehensively.

                              NEIL
               What's happening?

                              KRISTEN
               He's close...

                              NANCY
               Freddy?

                              KRISTEN
               He's heavy in the halls...

                              TARYN
                         (realizing)
               Where's Joey?

     They glance around -- Joey's not with them.

                              KRISTEN
               Freddy's got him!  We've got to help him!

     Neil grabs the door to throw it open -- but yanks his hand back as 
     the knob glows red hot.  The door begins to scorch and sizzle as 
     the room turns stifling hot.

                              WILL
               The room's changing!

     The walls begin to close in -- the group is backed into the center 
     of the room as it becomes rounded, cylindrical...like the inside 
     of a furnace.  Rivets appear as the walls become scorched steel 
     plate.  Neil staggers back.

                              NEIL
               This is crazy...crazy...

     He looks down --

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     -- his feet are slogging through smouldering ash.  He steps on a 
     child's charred ribcage -- it crumbles and snaps underfoot like a 
     brittle leaf.  A tiny skull is churned up.

     KINCAID

     hunkers down and tries to push through the steel door, but jumps 
     back as his hands are burned.

     THE GROUP

     looks about helplessly as the smoke gets denser.  ROARING flames 
     leap up around them.  Suddnely --

     THE FURNACE DOOR

     slams open to reveal Simms standing in a perfectly normal hospital 
     hallway.  Total silence.

                              SIMMS
               What's going on in here?

     REVERSE ANGLE

     The Group Therapy Room.  Neil, Nancy, and the others are seated in 
     their chairs, heads coming up as the awaken.  They gaze around, 
     still confused.

                              SIMMS (cont.)
               What's wrong with Joey?

     Joey is lying unconscious on the floor near his chair, arms and 
     legs spread-eagle (in the same pose as being lashed to the bed).  
     Simms rushes over and checks him.

                              SIMMS (cont.)
               He's not breathing!

     Neil pushes her out of the way and kneels over Joey, desperately 
     giving him mouth-to-mouth.

     INT. INTENSIVE CARE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON JOEY lying in a coma, hooked up to monitoring devices and 
     a respirator.  ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY as we DOLLY BACK, revealing a 
     team of TECHNICIANS and NUEROSURGEONS surrounding the bed.

     CONTINUE DOLLYING BACK until we find ourselves IN THE HALLWAY 
     outside the room.  neil and Nancy hover by the door, sick with 
     worry.  DOCTOR CARVER (60's), the supervising physician of Westin 
     Hills, is stewing in controlled anger.  Dr. Simms is self-
     righteous now that her predicted disaster has taken place.

     The nuerosurgeons exit the room.                         
     NUEROSURGEON
                         (shakes his head)
               He's in a deep coma.  There's nothing
               we can do for him.

     The nurosurgeons walk away.  Carver turn to Neil.

                              CARVER
               This is insexcusable.

                              SIMMS
               The session was unauthorized.  It was
               purposely conducted without my knowledge.

                              NEIL
               Unusual steps were called for.

                              CARVER
               Is that what I should tell this young 
               man's parents?
                         (beat)
               I understand you prescribed a highly 
               experimental drug.

                              NANCY
               Dr. Carver, he's not in a coma because
               of the Hypnocyl.

                              CARVER
               Young lady, your opinion is of no 
               interest to me.  Furthermore, 
               according to Dr. Simms, you've been
               creating panic among the patients.

                              NEIL
               That's not true.

                              CARVER
               Dr. Goldman, in the last four days we've
               had two suicides.  Now a boy is in a 
               coma.  I think it's fair to say your
               approach has failed...entirely.
                         (beat)
               You're both relieved of your duties.
               I want you out of here.  Today.

                              NANCY
               Dr. Carver --

     Neil motions her quiet.  Carver exits.

                              SIMMS
               I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on
               yourself.

                              NEIL
                         (softly)
               For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try
               to help the kids, will you?  Listen
               to them.

                              SIMMS
                         (softening)
               Of course.

     She exits.  Only Nancy and Neil remain.

                              NANCY
               What are we going to do?

                              NEIL
                         (softly)
               There's nothing we can do.  It's out of
               our hands.

     He walks away.  She watches his go, then look in Joey.  She is 
     desolate.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Neil has packed several boxes of personal files into the trunk of 
     his BMW.  He places the final box in -- it's stuffed with drawings 
     from the kids...and some photographs.

     INSERT - THE PHOTOGRAPH ON TOP

     A picture of a group picnic -- featuring Neil with Jennifer and 
     Phillip.

     CLOSEUP - NEIL

     stares sadly at the picture for an extended beat.

     LOW ANGLE

     As Neil slams the trunk, the unused wing of the hospital is 
     revealed in the background.  It is old, untended, crumbling.  A 
     shrouded white figure is standing in one of the upper floor 
     windows.

     NEIL

     sees the figure and reacts, startled.

     THE FIGURE IN THE WINDOW

     is the nun from the funeral.  She has been staring out the window 
     at him.  She turns away and disappears from view.

     NEIL

     pauses for a moment, then approaches the building.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Neil comes to a set of double doors and rattles them -- they're 
     sealed with a rusty chain and padlock.

     He moves to a broken window and peers through the boards nailed 
     across it.

     NEIL'S POV

     He can see into the long main hallway of the ground floor.  He 
     gets a brief glimpse of the nun at the far end as she comes down 
     the stairs, turns on the landing, and heads downstairs to the 
     basement.

     NEIL

                              NEIL
                         (knocking on the board)
               Sister?  Sister!

     She hasn't heard him.  He pries the loose board away and enters 
     through the window.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. OLD WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - NIGHT

     A forgotten, dusty corridor with peeled paint like parchment on 
     the water-stained walls.  Neil comes down the stairs, peering 
     around in the gloom.

     The only feature in the dead end hallway is a partially open rusty 
     iron door with a small barred window.  A FAINT BUZZING rises and 
     falls from within.

                              NEIL
               Excuse me.  Sister?

     No answer.  Just another swell of FAINT BUZZING.  Neil approaches 
     the door and pushes it open all the way.  It SQUEALS LOUDLY on its 
     hinges.

     INT. ROOM

     Neil enters a huge, shadowy, dungeon-like room.  Flaking cement 
     pillars stand draped with cobwebs.  Rusted remains of bedframes 
     and scraps of wood litter the floor.  The BUZZING grows louder, 
     then falls away again.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               Hello?

     A wooden match ignites near him, going off like a gunshot in the 
     stillness -- the nun is reavealed.  Neil gasps, startled.

                              NUN
               This is where it began.

     She turns and lights a candle in a tiny alcove before a statue of 
     the Virgin Mary.  Dim light sputters up.

                              NEIL
               This wing's been closed for years.
                         (looking around)
               What was this place?

                              NUN
               Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of
               men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst
               of the criminally insane, were locked
               away in here like animals.

                              NEIL
               The whole facility was shut down in the
               Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of 
               scandal...

                              NUN
                         (she nods)
               A young girl on the staff was accidentally
               locked in here over the holidays.  The 
               inmates managed to keep her hidden for
               days.  She was raped...hundreds of times.
               When they found her, she was barely 
               alive...and with child.

                              NEIL
                         (softly)
               My God.

                              NUN
               That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her 
               child --

                              NEIL
               Freddy.

                              NUN
               The bastard son of a hundred maniacs.
               Some say he was murdered, though no 
               body was ever found.

     Neil is momentarily distracted by another swell of BUZZING.  A fly 
     brushes past his face in the darkness.

                              NEIL
               You said something before...about 
               laying him to rest...?

                              NUN
               You must find the remains...and bury
               them in hallowed ground.

     The nun turns and climbs the stairs.

                              NEIL
                         (blankly)
               Hallowed ground?

     he moves to follow her, but his foot comes in contact with 
     something near the bottom of the steps.  The BUZZING SWELLS UP 
     LOUDLY.  He jumps back.

     NEIL'S POV

     The grisly carcass of a cat stares up at Neil, hundreds of flies 
     swarming in its dessicated flesh.

     THE NUN

     Pausing at the top of the stairs.

                              NUN
               If your only faith is science, Doctor...
               it may be you that's laid to rest.

     As she exits, the door begins to CREAK slowly shut behind her, 
     plunging the room into darkness.

     NEIL

     scrambles up the steps and grabs the door just before it closes 
     shut.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Neil heaves a sigh of relief as he exits the Pit.  He looks 
     around.  The nun has disappeared.

     ON JOEY

     Short slashes suddenly begin to criss-cross his smooth chest.

     He comes to her side and looks down.

     NANCY AND NEIL

     gazing on in horror.

               You're not going in.  That's exactly what
               he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl,
               it's the only way he can get to you.

               Don't you think I know that?  I don't

               They burned him to death in his boiler

                              KRISTEN
               NOOOOOOOO!

     Simms is standing by, watching the struggle.

               You can't send them away!  You can't!

               You're a sick girl.  You can only get
               better if you trust me now.

     Kristen is fighting like a wildcat -- momentum carries her and the 
     orderlies into the nurse's desk and sends them sprawling in a 
     shower of desktop items.

     She hurls a heavy stapler in Simms' direction before Max and

               her!

     Kristen is dragged down the hall, fighting and kicking every inch 
     of the way.

                              KRISTEN
                         (screeming)

               KILLING US!

     EXT. LITTLE NEMO'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     "Tavern" is too nice a word -- it is a dive bar with a flickering 
     neon sign on the worst side of town.

     INT. LITTLE NEMO'S

     The sort of place you wind up when you have no place left to go.

     A dark, grubby figure sits in the deep foreground nursing a beer 
     and staring at nothing.  His unshaven face is hard and bitter, 
     haunted by old sorrows.  He wears a sodden, rumpled 
     nightwatchman's uniform.

                              NANCY (O.S.)
               Hello Father.

     DONALD THOMPSON looks up slowly from his beer.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Nancy stands nearby with Neil.  Thompson smiles wanly.

                              THOMPSON
               Well, if it isn't my little girl...
               come to visit her Daddy.

                              NANCY
               It's been a long time.

                              THOMPSON
               Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so
               lucky?  I thought you were trying to 
               forget I was alive.

                              NANCY
               That's not true.  You're the one who's 
               trying to forget.

     She sits across from him.  Neil hovers at her side.

                              NANCY (cont.)
               I need your help.  Krueger's back.

                              THOMPSON
                         (chuckles)
               Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a 
               little trouble understanding that,
               Princess.

                              NANCY
               You know what he did.  He's doing it
               again.

                              NEIL
               She's telling the truth.

     Thompson's eye flick up at Neil.

                              THOMPSON
                         (low, dangerous)
               I don't recall as we ever met, friend.
               And I don't believe this is any of 
               your goddamn business.

     Neil is taken aback for a moment -- he's about to retort, but 
     Nancy silences him with a look.  She leans in to her father.

                              NANCY
               I think we can stop him this time.  
               Stop him for good.  But we need to 
               know where the bones were hidden.

                              THOMPSON
                         (slow, measured)
               I lost too much over this already.  I'm
               through with it.

                              NANCY
               People are still dying.  After all this
               time.  Stop running away from it.
                         (no response)
               Daddy, please...don't make me beg.
                         (still no response)
               You owe me.

     Thompson meets his daughter's gaze, then averts his eyes.  He 
     takes a slow draw on his drink.

                              THOMPSON (cont.)
               It's been nice seeing you, baby.
               Don't stay away so long next time.

     Nancy can't handle another moment -- she bolt from the table as 
     tears come.  Neil glares at Thompson and hurries after her.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Neil folllows her to the restroom alcove, where she is trying to 
     pull herself together.

                              NEIL
               Nancy...

                              NANCY
               I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.

     He wants to comfort her, but doesn't really have the words.  He 
     stands by, looking miserable.  His BEEPER GOES OFF.  He checks it 
     for the number and crosses to the payphone.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. HOSPITAL TV ROOM - NIGHT

     Taryn snatches the payphone off the wall on the first ring.  Will 
     and Kincaid are with her.

               Doctor Goldman?

     INT. TAVERN

     Neil on the phone, Nancy at his shoulder.

                              NEIL
               Taryn?  Is that you?  What's the matter?

     INT. HOSPITAL

                              TARYN
               You gotta come right away.  It's Kristen.
               She had a total shit attack when Simms          
     told us you and Nancy got fired.

     INT. TAVERN

     Neil listens, his face draining of color.

                              NEIL
               Oh Christ.
                         (to Nancy)
               Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room
               for the night.  They sedated her.

                              NANCY
               No...

     INT. HOSPITAL

                              TARYN
               She's too doped up to stay awake for
               long.  She's alone in there -- alone!
               Freddy's gonna get her!

     INT. TAVERN

                              NEIL
               Okay, none of you panic.  Just stay
               cool.  Help's on the way.

     He hangs up.

                              NANCY
               We've got to get over there now.  We
               have to make Sims understand!

     He digs out his car keys and holds them out to her.

                              NEIL
               You go.

     She stares at him, not understanding.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               I'm gonna get the remains.

                              NANCY
                         (indicating her father)
               Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.

                              NEIL
               Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her
               awake somehow.
                         (Nancy tries to argue)
               Do it.

     Nancy takes the keys.  Their eyes lock for a long, intense moment 
     -- then they share a spontaneous, passionate kiss.

     Nancy turns and leaves without another word.

     ANGLE ON THOMPSON

     He sees his daughter leave, then turns his blank gaze back to his 
     beer.

     Neil casually walks over.  Thompson ignores him.

                              NEIL
               I'm Neil Goldman.  Pleased to meet you.
                         (beat)
               There, we've met.

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, Neil lashes viciously out with his foot 
     and kicks the table over -- everything goes flying.  Before 
     Thompson can so much as blink, neil hauls him out of his chair and 
     slams him violently against the wall.

     TIGHT TWO SHOT

     Neil and Thompson, nose to nose.  Neil speaks with barely 
     contained rage.

                              NEIL
                         (low, tight)
               Listen up, asshole.  I don't know if
               you care whether Nancy lives or dies,
               but I do.
                         (pause)
               You and I are going on a little 
               scavenger hunt.

     Thompson stares at Neil, dumbfounded.

     INT. QUIET ROOM - NIGHT

     Kristen wanders in aimless circles in the confinement of the small 
     padded room, weeping with despair as she desperately tries to stay 
     on her feet.

                         (weakly)
               Please God...please...

     She stumbles and lurches into the wall, held up by sheer luck 
     alone.  She pushes herself away, staggering -- her movements are 
     jerky and uncordinated.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     A small church in a poor neighborhood.  Thompson's battered old 
     Dodge grinds to a stop at the curb.

     INT. DODGE

                              THOMPSON
                         (dourly regards teh church)
               What the hell are we doing here?

     Neil reaches over, shuts off the ignition, and takes the key.  
     There is a pint bottle of whiskey juting from Thompson's jacket 
     pocket.  Neil snatches the bottle before Thompson can react.

                              THOMPSON (cont.)
               Hey!

                              NEIL
               I won't be long.

     Neil gets out of the car.  he empties the contents of the pint 
     bottle on the pavement as he hurries toward the church.

     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     Three WORSHIPPERS are seated in the pews, seeking comfort in 
     silent prayer.  Neil rushes in at the back of the church.

     CLOSER - NEIL

     sees a small basin of holy water attached to the wall.  he 
     submerges Thompson's bottle, filling it with holy water.  He caps 
     the bottle, pockets it, then proceeds up the aisle.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Neil comes to a candle shrine.  A foot-high crucifix is attached 
     to the wall above it.  He grabs the cross and tries to lift it off 
     its mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a lift it off its 
     mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a jarring sound in the 
     silent church.  Worshippers turn to look.

     Feeling comspicuous, Neil turns to find himself facing a PRIEST.

                              NEIL
               Oh.  Hello.

                              PRIEST
               What do you think you're doing?

                              NEIL
               Look, I'm sorry, but I need this...

     He digs out his wallet.  Empty.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               I swear I'll reimburse you.  Really. 
               Here, keep my driver's license.  I'll
               be back.

     Neil hurries out, leaving the baffled priest holding his driver's 
     license.

     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Nancy enters, hurrying toward the Quiet Room.  Max appears, 
     blocking her from the Quiet Room hallway.

                              NANCY
               Max, I have ot see Kristen!

     Max shakes his head.

                              NANCY (cont.)
               You don't understand -- 

     The big man holds up his hand for silence.

                              MAX
               Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr.
               Simms gave me specific instructions.
               Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially
               you.  She made that real clear.

                              NANCY
               But Max, she needs me.  It could mean
               life or death.

     Max pauses briefly...and decides to speak his mind.

                              MAX
                         (softly)
               Look, I think you really mean well...
               but my kids been dyin' off.  Even if I
               didn't have orders from Simms, I wouldn't
               let you near her.  No way.

     Nancy backs down.  There's no way she'll get past him.

                              NANCY
               Okay, Max...I understand.
                         (a plea)
               Can I say goodbye to the others?

     Max wavers, his emotions getting to him.

                              MAX
               I don't know...

                              NANCY
               It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?

     It's against his better judgement, but Max finally nods.

                              MAX
               You got five minutes.

                              NANCY
               Thank you.

     She heads toward the dorms.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She comes around the corner.  Taryn, Will, and Kincaid have been 
     waiting for her, frantic with worry.

                              TARYN
               What'd you do, take the scenic route?

                              NANCY

     EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

     A vast auto junkyard on the outskirts of town.  Towering stacks of 
     gutted cars glitter in the moonlight like the crusty bones of some 
     long ago dinosaur graveyard.  It is an awesome, twisting maze.

     Thompson's Dodge pulls up to the gate.  The headlights reveal a 
     faded sign on the tall chain link fence:  "PENNY BROS. AUTO 
     SALVAGE."

                              THOMPSON
               In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place.
               We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm
               not even sure I can find it again.

                              NEIL
               How do we get in?

                              THOMPSON
               They used to keep a spare key.

     EXT. CAR

     Thompson steps out and crosses to teh wood stat structure that 
     serves as the junkyard's office and reaches under the porch.

     CLOSER - THE GATE

     Thompson steps into the headlight beams and unlocks teh rusted 
     padlock.

     Suddenly, a vicious junkyard dog shoots up into frame, barking and 
     slavering just inches from his face, rattling the chain link 
     fence.

                              THOMPSON
                         (unruffled)
               Hey, Jesse James.  Don't you remember
               me, boy?

     He swings the gate open and offers an open hand to the dog.  Jesse 
     sniffs the hand suspiciously, then wags his tail.

                              THOMPSON (cont.)
               That a boy.

     He turns, motioning to Neil to bring the car through.  Neil scoots 
     to the driver's side.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Neil pulls the car in and stops at the mouth of the maze.  
     Thompson secures the gate.

     INT. CAR

     Thompson gets back in on the passenger side.  Neil is suddenly 
     playing chauffer.

                              THOMPSON
               All right.  It's deep in the heart of this
               place.  Take it slow.

     Neil eases on the gas.

     Nancy closes the door and turns to the kids.  They look to her, 
     waiting.

               Okay, straight talk only in here.

               But Joey's in there.  And Kristen's 
               going in with or without us.  They need
               us.

                              WILL
               You mean we're gonna try to go in with
               her?  To link up?

                              NANCY
               It's now or never.  I won't kid you.
               This is as dangerous as it gets.  If
               you die in the dream, it's for real.
               Nobody has to go in that doesn't want
               to.

     THE KIDS

     A long silence.  Their faces reflect conflicting emotions.  Fear, 
     dread, anticipation.  Then, quietly:

                              WILL
               I'm in.

                              TARYN
               Me too.

                              KINCAID
               Let's go kick that motherfucker's ass all
               over dreamland.

     Her face reflects the same emotions -- but mostly, there is pride 
     in the kids.  She turns the pendulum on and sits with them.

                              NANCY
               Now remember -- whatever happens, stay
               together.  That's the only way we can 
               beat him.

     THE GROUP

     Staring intensely at the pendulum.

                              NANCY
                         (softly)
               Clear your minds...of everything.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

     Thompson's car pulls slowly around a tight corner and stos in what 
     amounts to a small clearing deep in the labyrinth of stacked 
     autos.

     Thompson and Neil get out, the weak headlights of teh old Dodge 
     illminating the towering heaps of rusted metal surrounding them.  
     Thompson peers around, then points.

                              THOMPSON
               That's it.  The Caddy.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The rear end of a ravaged 59 Cadillac sticks out from beneath a 
     huge stack of automotive carcasses, its rusted tailfins jutting 
     like the spines of some prehistoric beast.

     Neil crosses to the car and runs his hands over the corroded 
     surface of the trunk.  He tries to lift it, but it's locked tight.

     THOMPSON

     stands beside the Dodge.  He takes a swig from a pint bottle and 
     glances around into the darkness nervously.

     NEIL

     finds a large four-pronged tire iron -- three ends for lug nuts, 
     the other end a sharp wedge.  He jams it under teh trunk lid and 
     applies pressure.

     CLOSEUP - THOMPSON

     observing nervously.

     NEIL

     leans his head closer to the trunk as he strains against the tire 
     iron.

     CLOSEUP - THE LOCK

     explodes in a cloud of rust.

     CLOSEUP - NEIL

     Gazing in.  PAN TO an ancient, crusty burlap sack lying in the 
     shadows of the trunk.

     INT. THOMPSON'S DODGE

     Thompson silently eases behind the wheel of his Dodge, careful not 
     to draw Neil's attention.  he's going to get the hell out of 
     here      --

     -- but there are no keys in the ignition.  Thompson looks up, 
     glaring at Neil through the windshield.

     EXT. DODGE

     Neil holds up Thompson's keys.

                              NEIL
               Going somewhere?

     Thompson gets out of the car.

                              THOMPSON
               I showed you where the goddamn thing was.
               I didn't say I'd stick around.

     Neil tosses Thompson a shovel.

                              NEIL
               We've got work to do.

                              THOMPSON
               What are you talking about?

                              NEIL
               You're about to attend a funeral.  One
               that's long overdue.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - NIGHT

     Nancy and the kids are staring at the pendulum, faces slack.  
     Nancy's voice is a soft hush.  They are being lulled into the 
     dream state.

                              NANCY
               Picture yourselves in the Quiet Room...
               the soft white walls...the total 
               silence...just the sound of your 
               hearts beating.  Picture yourself
               there...with Kristen.
                         (beat)
               I'm going to count backwards from five.
               And when I'm done, we'll all be 
               asleep...we'll all be in the Quiet Room.

     INT. QUIET ROOM - NIGHT

     Kristen is slumped in a corner, face against the wall, totally 
     incoherent now.  There is no more fight left in her.  She is 
     fading...fading...

                              KRISTEN
                         (a bare whisper)

     Kristen's eyes flutter open.

                              KRISTEN
               Nancy?

     WIDER ANGLE

     Nancy and the others are now in the Wuiet Room with Kristen.  
     Kristen looks around, crying and happy that her friends are here.  
     She hugs them in turn -- a sweet, teary reunion.

                              KRISTEN (cont.)
               I knew you'd come.

                              NANCY
               You didn't think we'd let you go alone?

                              KINCAID
               No fuckin' way.  We're a team.

                              KRISTEN
               Joey needs us.  I can feel him.

                              NANCY
               How do we find him, Kristen?

     THE WALL

     Four huge razors slash through the canvas -- RIIIIIIP!  Cotton 
     padding flies.

     THE GROUP

     reacts as teh razors vanish -- then RIP from the wall directly 
     behind them.  Everyone moves to the center of the room.

                              NANCY
               Whatever happens, stay together!

     VARIOUS ANGLES

     Cotton padding billows through the air as the razors slash through 
     the wall again and again -- from in front, from behind, from the 
     side, from the floor, from everywhere.

     The Quiet room becomes a white void of ripping and slashing -- a 
     vicious blizzard of whirling padding.

     WILL

     The blades lash out from the billowing clouds of cotton.  He's 
     forced back.

     TARYN

     screams as the blades flash by her.

     NANCY

                              NANCY
                         (shielding her eyes)
               HOLD HANDS!  FIND EACH OTHER!

     KRISTEN

     Screaming, panicking, spun around in the blizzard.  Lost.

                              KRISTEN
               NANCY!

     CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

     The blizzard of cotton padding dissipates and slowly vanishes.  
     Kristen looks up a dream.

     ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY OUT to reveal Kristen sitting at her drafting 
     table in her bedroom at home.  The crude paper mache Elm Street 
     House model is in front of her, still under construction.  Warren 
     Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" still blares from the radio.

     Nothing has changed.  She's still home.  Safe.  She wonders if all 
     of it, everything, has been nothing but a bad dream.

     Her mother enters, dressed in the same beautiful evening gown, and 
     snaps the radio off.

                              ELAINE
               Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!

                              KRISTEN
                         (bleary-eyed)
               Mom?

                              ELAINE
               What are you still doing up?  It's past 
               one.

                              KRISTEN
               I thought I'd wait for you.

                              ELAINE
                         (touched)
               Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
               to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

     She turns down teh covers.  Kristen crawls onto the bed and throws 
     her arms around Elaine's neck in a spontaneous hug.

                              ELAINE (cont.)
               What's that for?

                              KRISTEN
               I'm just glad you're home.

     Elaine gives her a kiss and tucks her in.  She goes to teh door 
     and reaches for the lightswitch.

                              KRISTEN (cont.)
               Mom?

                              ELAINE
                         (pauses in doorway)
               What?

                              KRISTEN
               I had such an awful dream.

     A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

                              MAN (O.S.)
               Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

                              ELAINE
               I'll be right down.
                         (to Kristen)
               Kris, I've got a guest.

                              KRISTEN
               Can we talk?  Just for a minute?

                              ELAINE
               Can't it wait till morning?

                              KRISTEN
               Please Mom?  I just don't want to be 
               alone.

     Suddenly, Elaine is violently yanked out the door, revealing:

     FREDDY

     framed in the doorway, wearing immaculate formal wear, screaming 
     at Elaine (she's off camera).

                              FREDDY
               BITCH!  I SAID WHERE'S THE FUCKING 
               BOURBON!

     He sweeps his razors down at her.

     KRISTEN

     SCREMING in bed.

     FREDDY

     Grinning insanely, he leans into the room, holding Elaine's 
     decapitated head up for Kristen.

                              FREDDY
               You should listen to your mother,
               Kristen.

     CLOSEUP - ELAINE'S HEAD

     Dangling in Freddy's grasp, blood dripping from the neck, it 
     jabbers at Kristen in a glassy-eyed harangue.

                              ELAINE'S HEAD
               Gaddamn it Kristen, you always ruin
               everything!  Every time I have a man 
               over you spoil it!  You know what 
               your shrink said!  You're only trying
               to get attention!

     KRISTEN

     screaming and screaming.

     FREDDY

     drops the head and lunges at her, claws swiping the air.

     KRISTEN

     rolls out of bed as Freddy's claws tear her pillow open in an 
     explosion of feathers.

     WIDER

     Kristen turns and runs, Freddy right on her heels,  his finger 
     blades mere inches from her back.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Kristen's momentum takes her right up the wall -- she pushes off 
     in an incredible gymnast's flip, hurtling up in an arc back over 
     Freddy's head -- Freddy hits the wall, his finger-razors burying 
     deep in the plaster.

     KRISTEN

     makes a perfect landing near her bed and snatches up her 
     bedspread.

     FREDDY

     howls with rags and yanks his razors from the wall in an explosion 
     of plaster.  he whirls and dives at Kristen --

     -- as she flings the bedspread over him.  He tangles up, going 
     down hard, thrashing to get free.

     KRISTEN 

     hurtles herself out the window in an explosion of glass.

     FREDDY

     Ripping and slashing,  he wrestles the bedspread off and hurls it 
     away in tatters.  He looks aroudn, howling with rage.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kristen EXPLODES through a skylight in the living room ceiling and 
     drops to teh floor in a rain of glass.  Bruised and battered, she 
     rises to her feet and looks around.  Lost.  Alone.

                              KRISTEN
                         (calling out)
               Nancy!

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Whirling cotton fills the screen...dissipating to reveal Taryn in 
     her full dream warrior splendor, platinum crest of hair 
     shimmering.  She finds herself in a twisting hallway in teh 
     dreamscape -- and hears KRISTEN'S FAINT CALL.

                              TARYN
                         (calling out)
               Kristen?  Is that you?

     She hurries up a passageway and turns a corner.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Freddy leaps from the darkness, blades flashing.

     Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls, producing two large gravity 
     knives.  She click-clacks them open, twirling them expertly.

                              TARYN
               Okay asshole.  Let's dance.

     Freddy gives her an evil smile and squares off against her.

     They circle each otehr slowly...then Freddy lashes out.

     Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddy's ribs.

     Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more, ripping deep 
     gouges in Taryn's shoulder.

     Taryn draws back, keeping her guard up.  She feints, then strikes 
     out, slashing Freddy again.

     This time Freddy draws back.

                              FREDDY
               Taryn...why should we fight?  You and
               I are old friends.

     Taryn stands poised, ready for anything.

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY

                              FREDDY
                         (grinning)
               Let's get high.

     He raises his hands into frame -- his fingerhave all turned into 
     oversized hypodermic neeles, their needle-sharp tips glittering in 
     the darkness.

     TARYN

     Revolted by teh weird display.  She looks down, feeling something 
     strange.

     CLOSEUP - TARYN'S ARMS

     Her needle track scars are expanding and contracting like tiny 
     sucking mouths...hungry...

     WIDER

     The instant her guard is down, Freddy lunges at her and buries 
     both sets of hypodermic fingers into her arms, pinning her to the 
     wall.  Taryn SCREAMS.

     CLOSEUP - HYPO FINGERS

     As their inner plunges depress, Taryn's biceps swell grotesquely, 
     veins bulging impossibly.

     TARYN

     We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her 
     veins and body balloon, racing from her arms -- her neck swells -- 
     temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

     Then the top of her head literally explodes.

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY

                              FREDDY
               What a rush.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET BASEMENT - NIGHT

     MOVING WITH Will -- he holds a torch high in one hand, a saber in 
     the other.  He looks like a thin pirate out of a Dungeons and 
     Dragons game.

                              WILL
                         (calling out)
               Hello?  You guys, where are you?

     He heas a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead.  He 
     pauses...nothing.  Suddenly, there's a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL 
     and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him.  He 
     lunges out of the way.

     THE OBJECT

     screeches to a halt and wheels about.  It's an oversiezed, 
     nightmarish version of Will's wheelchair -- made of rusty, twisted 
     metal and bristling with spikes and hooks.  To sit in it would be 
     agonizing death.

                              FREDDY (O.S.)
               You look tired, Will.  Have a seat.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Will whirls about to see Freddy leaning nonchalantly against a 
     pillar.

                              WILL
                         (shaken)
               No thanks.  I'm fine just the way I am.

                              FREDDY
               For now.  But when you wake up...
                         (singing)
               ...you're back in the saddle again.

     Will is visibly upset by this -- and reacts too slowly as the 
     wheelchair bears down on him again.

     WILL

     is sideswiped and knocked to the ground, his leg bleeding.

     THE CHAIR

     spins around, preparing for another run.

     FREDDY

                              FREDDY
               It's the chair for you, kid.

     THE CHAIR

     The wheels smoke, burning rubber as it launches itself at Will.

     CLOSEUP - WILL

                              WILL
                         (softly, to himself)
               I'm the Dungeonmaster...the Dungeonmaster...

     WIDER

     Will suddenly levitates to his feet.  A wizard's robe swirls about 
     him as crackling electricity plays across his fingertips, just 
     like the illustration on the Dungeonmaster game card.

     LOW ANGLE

     The wheelchair ROARS over camera.

     WILL

     Green lightning explodes from his fingertips and shatters the 
     wheelchair into fragments.

     FREDDY

     reacts in surprise.

     WILL

     looks up at Freddy, grinning with his newfound power.  The dancing 
     lights emanating from his fingers cast a weird glow across his 
     face.

                              WILL
               In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves --
               demon begone!

     WIDER

     Will rushes at Freddy, shooting wizard's fire.  The crackling 
     green energy engulfs Freddy completely --

     -- but Freddy grabs Will by the front of his shirt and lifts him 
     off the ground.

     CLOSER

     Freddy snarls into Will's face as the living energy twines around 
     him.

                              FREDDY
               Sorry kid.  I don't believe in fairy 
               tales.

     Freddy buries his claws in Will's chest -- the blades points jut 
     out of Will's back as his death cry ECHOES down teh halls.

                                                        CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kristen wanders through the twisting distorted hallways of the 
     dreamscape.  She hears Will's SCREAM echo and fade away.

                              KRISTEN
               HELLO?  ANYBODY?

                              NANCY'S VOICE
                         (faint, faraway)
               Kristen?

     She turns a corner and sees Nancy at the end of a hallway.

                              KRISTEN (cont.)
               Nancy!

     They rush toward each other -- but stop as they hear a strange 
     CRUNCHING SOUND.

                              KRISTEN
               What's that?

                              NANCY
               I don't know.

     The SOUND comes again -- a horrible CRACKING AND SNAPPING.  The 
     wall begins to spiderweb with cracks as it bulges outward.  
     Something big seems to be trying to press through to cut them off 
     from each other.  Nancy and Kristen back away warily.

     Suddenly, there is an EXPLOSION of wood and plaster -- and Kincaid 
     steps through.

                              KINCAID
                         (grinning)
               Yo.  I thought I heard voices.

     Nancy and Kristen yell with delight.  Kristen throws her arms 
     around him.

                              KRISTEN
               Kincaid!  I could kiss you!

                              KINCAID
               What's stopping you?

     Kristen is taken aback for a moment -- then gives him a chaste but 
     sincere kiss on the mouth.  He grins.

                              KINCAID
               Cool.  So where's Joey?

                              KRISTEN
               I don't know.  It's like a maze in here.

                              KINCAID
               Then it's time to stop guessin' and
               start messin'.
                         (hollering)
               FREDDY!  WHERE YOU HIDING, YOU PUSSY?

                              NANCY
               Kincaid -- we should find the others
               first...

                              KINCAID
               YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID --
               LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!
                         (silence)
               KRUEGER!

     Still no response.

                              KINCAID (cont.)
                         (muttering)
               I knew he was chickensh--

     Suddenly, the lights around them flinker and dim.  They hear a 
     DEEP, REVERBERATING GROAN OF METAL.  All look over the railing.

     OVER THE SHOULDER

     as they peer downward.  Where before there was nothing, there are 
     now two huge, rusty boiler room doors slowly swinging open like 
     the entrance to Hell.  Orange light flickers from below.

     KINCAID

     Still finishing his prior statement.

                              KINCAID
               -- shhhiiiiit.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The tree slowly descend teh stairs, all bravado lost.  They stop 
     before the immense gate.  Within lies flickering darkness and 
     twisting steps leading down.

                              NANCY
               This is it.  Are you ready?

     Kristen nods.

                              KINCAID
               Let's snuff the fucker.

     They descend.

     INT. BOILER ROOM - ENTRANCE

     Nancy, Kristen, and Kincaid cautiously come down the winding 
     stairs and pass under an arch way made of twisted, scorched 
     tricycles and shattered dolls.

     They exchange worried looks, then step through.

     MASTER

     A surrealistic boiler room, air red with heat and haze.

     Freddy sits on a throne made of children's skulls and bones.

     Joey is nearby, suspended over the pit of flames like a weird 
     altar.

     Welcome to Freddy Hell.

     FREDDY

                              FREDDY
                         (low gutteral chuckle)
               Look Joey...all the little piggies have
               come home.

     JOEY

     He turns his terrified, pleading eyes toward his friends.  His 
     skin is hot and blistered.  The tongues that lash his hands and 
     feet to the four posts are writhing slowly, licking his ankles and 
     wrists.  He opens his mouth in a mute, silent scream.

     NANCY, KRISTEN, KINCAID

                              KRISTEN
                         (softly)
               Joey...

     Nancy steps forward.

                              NANCY
               Let him go.

     THE THRONE

     Freddy sweeps his hands, the obedient servant.

                              FREDDY
               Your wish is my command.

     He makes a gesture.

     JOEY

     The tongue/creature securing his left wrist unravels -- he drops 
     precariously.  The other tongues begin to loosen their hold.

     NANCY

     lunges to the edge of the pit, reaching for Joey.

     FREDDY

     laughs maniacally.

     THE PIT

     The last tongues give way and Joey drops --

     -- just as Nancy snatches his wrist and hangs on.  Kincaid grabs 
     Nancy by the belt and hauls them both back out.

     KRISTEN

     With a cry, she runs and does a double flip over the burning 
     pit -- right at Freddy.

     THE THRONE

     Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddy's face, toppling him and the 
     throne backwards.

     KINCAID

     strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and 
     races toward the throne.

     NANCY

     helps Joey to his feet just as a tongue/creature flies out of the 
     darkness and whips around her neck, strangling her.

     FREDDY

     rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen.  She 
     flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her, sending her 
     spinning across the room.

     NANCY

     Clutching one end of the writhing tongue, she forces it to the 
     ground.  She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature.  It 
     instantly unravels from her neck.

     THE FALLEN THRONE

     As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen, Kincaid races in, swinging 
     his pipe in a wide arc.  It smashes across Freddy's back, driving 
     him to his knees.

     Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow, but Freddy leaps up 
     with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid, hauling him high over his head.

     Nancy rushes in just as Freddy's arms are extended and plunges the 
     poker into his heart.

     Everyone freezes.

     FREDDY

     looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a 
     grin at Nancy.

     NANCY

     reacts in horror.

     FREDDY

     releases Kincaid's feet and holds him dangling by the throat.

     With his free hand, he pulls the poker slowly from his chest.  He 
     looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark, rancid gore.  He licks 
     it like an ice cream cone.

     NANCY AND KRISTEN

     Kristen rises, using Nancy for support.

                              KRISTEN
               Nancy!

                              NANCY
               He's too strong!  He was never this
               strong!

     FREDDY

     whirls to her, Kincaid still choking in his upraised fist.

                              FREDDY
                         (hissing)
               Yesss!  The souls of the children...

     He rips his shirt open, revealing his hideously scarred body.

                              FREDDY (cont.)
               ...they make me stronger.

     His flesh begins to undulate and swell.

     TIGHT ON FREDDY'S TORSO

     Rippling blisters appear, forming into faces -- horrible, tortured 
     faces wailing in despair.  We recognize Phillip ... Jennifer ... 
     Will ... Taryn ...

     NANCY AND KRISTEN

     Total horror and revulsion.

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY

     An insane, gleeful grin -- and a gutteral whisper:

                              FREDDY
               Always room for more.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - TRUNK OF '59 CADILLAC - NIGHT

     The burlap sack is lifted out.

     TIGHT ON BURLAP SACK

     as neil drops it beside a freshly dug grave.  Freddy's bones 
     clatter.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

     Freddy flinches in pain -- he looks up in fear, suddenly aware 
     that somebody's disturved his bones.  His fear is slowly replaced 
     by an evil, cunning grin.

     He vanishes -- Kincaid finds himself struggling and choking in 
     mid-air.  He drops to the ground, gasping for breath.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

     Thompson crawls from the shallow grave and throws the shovel 
     aside.

                              THOMPSON
               What the hell good is this supposed to
               do?

     Ignoring him, Neil picks up the tire iron and holds it up.

                              NEIL
               This will be our headstone.

     He jams the tire iron into the ground at the foot of the grave.  
     It looks like a cross.

                              THOMPSON
                         (hears something)
               What was that?

                              NEIL
               What?

                              THOMPSON
               Listen.

     Neil now hears the FAINT SOUND OF ROCK MUSIC on the night breeze.

                              NEIL
               Somebody else is out here.

                              THOMPSON
               No.  We're alone.

     Another song snaps to life -- closer to them.  The Rolling Stones'  
     "Sympathy for the Devil."

     INT. WRECKED CHEVY

     We can see Neil and Thompson through the cracked windshield of the 
     rusted-out Chevy.  The radio suddenly lights up, blaring another 
     rock song.

     NEIL AND THOMPSON

     More MUSIC comes from all around them, blasting from teh radios of 
     long-dead autos, a cacophony of rock songs from the 50's and 60's.  
     We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack.

     THE CARS - VARIOUS ANGLES

     Broken headlights sputter to life.  A windshield wiper near 
     Thompson slaps madly back and forth across shattered glass.  Horns 
     honk.  An exposed fan blade WHIRRS like a buzzsaw.

     NEIL AND THOMPSON

                              THOMPSON
                         (hoarse whisper)
               The whole place is coming to life...

     Both men turn to look at the burlap sack.  There is a slight 
     stirring from within.

     Neil hurries over and grabs the sack to throw it into the grave.

     THE SACK

     Suddenly, a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the 
     rotted burlap and latches onto Neil's wrist.

     The sack rips wide open as Freddy's charred bones leap into 
     life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly 
     rage.

     THOMPSON

     Frozen  to the spot.  Can't believe his eyes.

     NEIL

     falls back, scrambling away as Freddy's blades slash the air 
     inches in front of his face.

     WIDER

     Suddenly, Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto 
     the hellish thing's back, biting and snapping.

     The skeleton pulls the dog from its back, slashes its throat in 
     one quick motion, and tosses the carcass aside.

     THOMPSON

     Something snaps in him as he glares at the skeleton.

                              THOMPSON
               It's really you.

     CLOSEUP - SKELETON

     It turns and grins hideously at Thompson.

     THOMPSON

     grabs a piece of pipe and rushes the monster.

                              THOMPSON
               I'll send you back to Hell here you
               belong!

     THE CREATURE 

     meets Thompson's rush head on, blocking the pipe and yanking him 
     off his feet.

     It hurls Thompson through the air with incredible force.

     THE CADILLAC

     Thompson slams into it, impaled on the tail fin.  He looks down at 
     the metal point jutting from his chest...and dies.

     NEIL

     grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes 
     Neil's ribs, ripping his shirt wide open.

     As Neil doubles over, the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands 
     and smashes it solidly against his head.  Before Neil can crumple, 
     the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we 
     hear BONE CRACK.  Neil falls back into the grave.

     The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the 
     loose dirt onto Neil.

     It tosses the shovel aside, raises its arms into the air with a 
     victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

     Nancy, Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey exit the boiler room, limping, 
     battered, and bloody.  They face the weird perspectives of the Elm 
     Street halls.

                              NANCY
               Kristen, can you pull us out?

                              KRISTEN
               They sedated me.  We're stuck here till
               it wears off.

                              NANCY
               Let's try this way.

     They start down a corridor and enter:

     INT. SEWING ROOM

     Eerie mannikins and an ornate three-way mirror stand in teh 
     shadows.

                              KRISTEN
               It's a dead end.

     Suddenly, there's activity in the mirror.  A wavering light...then 
     Freddy materializes.  An infinity of Freddies are reflected in the 
     three-way mirror behind him.

                              FREDDY
               Sorry to keep you waiting.  Perhaps if
               there were more of me to spread around.

     Freddy runs into the room, magically followed by rows of his 
     mirror reflections.

                              KINCAID
               Holy shit!  He's multiplying!

     The room is suddenly filled with dozens of Freddies slashing and 
     chasing our heroes.

     NANCY

     leaps over a wicker basket to escape a Freddy.  As a second Freddy 
     lunges, she jams a knitting needle through its throat.

     KRISTEN

     springs over a group of Freddies, catches a wall fixture, and 
     flips across the room.

     KINCAID

     With a battle cry, he plows into the charging Freddies, bowling 
     them over.

     JOEY

     cringes back, cowering behind the mannikins.

     THE MIRROR

     More Freddies pouring into the room.

     NANCY

     is backed into a corner, torn with slash marks.

     KRISTEN

     delivering flying kicks, but slowing down.  A Freddy grabs her 
     from behind, holding her for the others.

     KINCAID

     goes down under the sheer weight of Freddies crawling all over 
     him, slashing.  There are jsut too many.

     JOEY

     steps out from behind teh mannikins, shaking with emotion as his 
     friends are overwhelmed -- none of them can last more that a few 
     seconds longer.  He opens his mouth and -- 

     CLOSEUP - JOEY

                              JOEY
               NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

     An incridible, deafening, universe-shaking cry.  Joey has found 
     his dream power.

     THE THREE-WAY MIRROR

     is blown into fragments.

     VARIOUS ANGLES

     All the Freddies EXPLODING into shards of hurtling glass as nancy, 
     Kristen, and Kincaied cover their ears.

     JOEY

     finally stops.  Total silence.  He looks just as surprised as 
     everyone else at what he's done.

                              JOEY
                         (softly)
               Wow.
                         (does a double take
                          at his own voice)
               Did I say that?

                              KINCAID
               You sure as shit did!  You saved our
               asses!

                              KRISTEN
               He's gone!  We got him!

     Kincaid scoops Joey into his arms in a crushing bear hug.

                              JOEY
               Hey man, put me down!

     EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the open grave.  A bloody, dirt-encrusted hand grasps the 
     edge of teh grave.  A second hand follows.  Neil Goldman slowly, 
     painfully pulls himself out of the grave.

     He has an ugly wound on the side of his head and his collarbone's 
     broken -- but he's alive.

     Gasping with pain, Neil crawls to the pile of Freddy's remains.  
     With tremendous effort, he pushes hte bones over the edge into the 
     grave.

     CLOSEUP - GRAVE

     The bones tumble into the earthen pit.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

     Kristen helps Nancy to her feet as she brushes away the shattered 
     glass of the Freddies.

                              KRISTEN
               Are you okay?

                              NANCY
               I think so.

     They embrace tearfully.

                              NANCY
                         (softly)
               It's over.  It's over.

                              THOMPSON (O.S.)
               Nancy...

     Nancy turns and sees her father floating toward her, glowing in a 
     golden nimbus of light.

                              NANCY
               Daddy?

                              THOMPSON (cont.)
               I've crossed over, Princess.

                              NANCY
               Crossed over?

                              THOMPSON
               But I couldn't go until I told you how
               sorry I am for all the things I've done.

     Nancy gazes at him, slowly comprehending.

                              THOMPSON (cont.)
               I love you so much.  I'll always love
               you.  Goodbye, Princess.

     Nancy goes to embrace ehr father one final time.

                              NANCY
               I'll always love you, Dadd --

     Her words are cut short as her body jerks violently.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHT

     "Thompson" is wearing Freddy's glove -- the razors buried in 
     Nancy's stomach.

     CLOSEUP - NANCY

     Her eyes wide and staring as she realizes.

                              NANCY
                         (weakly)
               No.

     CLOSEUP - FREDDY/THOMPSON

     As Thompson's face disappears and is replaced by Freddy's.

                              FREDDY
               Die, bitch.

     He jams the blades in deeper.

     EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT

     CLOSEUP ON Neil -- using his one good hand, he grasps the bottle 
     of holy water and uncorks it with his teeth.  He presses it to his 
     forehead and closes his eyes.

                              NEIL
                         (hoarse whisper)
               Please God.  For the children.  For
               Nancy.

     He looks down at Freddy's remains.

                              NEIL (cont.)
               Ashes to ashes.

     He flicks a stream of holy water onto the bones.

     INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

     Freddy, still locked in an embrace with Nancy as she dies, SCREAMS 
     as a pattern of holes rip across his body -- bright shafts of 
     light burst through.

                                                       CUT TO:

                              NEIL

     He flicks a second stream of water.

     INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

     Another arc of holes explode across Freddy's body.  He arches 
     back, SHRIEKING --

     -- and Nancy slides of his blades.  Kristen runs to her.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Neil holds the crucifix.  He leans down and presses it against the 
     skull.

                              NEIL
               Lay this spirit to rest.

     INT. SEWING ROOM - CLOSEUP FREDDY

     A cross-shaped hole explodes from Freddy's forehead -- brilliant, 
     blinding white light pours out.

     WIDER

     As Freddy staggers back, riddled with glowing holes, we see a 
     whrilwind of spirit faces pouring from him -- sould of his victims 
     soaring out, freed at last.

     KINCAID AND JOEY

     Awestruck as they watch.

     FREDDY

     The holes expand, eating Freddy alive as his SCREAM ECHOES across 
     the dreamscape.

     The shafts of light from his body merge into one white hot ball -- 
     then EXPLODES.

     Freddy is gone.

     KRISTEN

     cradles Nancy in her arms.  nancy is drifting toward death.

                              KRISTEN
                         (crying)
               He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't
               die, Nancy.  Please.

                              NANCY
                         (weak)
               I'm so proud of you all.
                         (pause)
               Tell Neil I...

     She sags against Kristen.  Kristen shakes her head, tears 
     brimming.

                              KRISTEN
               I won't let you die.  i won't.
                         (lower, strange intensity)
               I'm going to dream you...
                         (whispering in Nancy's ear)
               I'm going to dream you into a beautiful
               dream.  Forever and ever.

     She closes her eyes and holds Nancy tight.

                                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

     Three caskets are surrounded by a large number of MOURNERS.

     CLOSER

     Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid watch tearfully.  Neil, wearing a neck 
     brace, puts his arm around the kids as the caskets are lowered.

     CLOSEUP - NEIL

     He notices movement on the hilltop.

     NEIL'S POV

     The nun stands on the crest of the hill.  She turns and walks 
     away, disappearing from view.

     NEIL

     leaves the funeral and starts up the hillside after her.

     HILLTOP

     As neil reaches the tree where he first met the nun, he catches a 
     glimpse of her as she dissappears behind a crypt.

                              NEIL
               Sister...wait.

     THE CRYPT

     Neil rounds the crypt -- the nun has vanished.

     Only a simple tombstone stands at this edge of the field.

     Neil steps closer.

     THE TOMBSTONE

     The inscription reads:

                    Here Lies Amanda Krueger

                       Her name in Christ,
                       Sister Mary Helena.

     EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The seasons have changed.  A blanket of freshly fallen snow covers 
     the house.  A VW Rabbit with New York plates is parked in the 
     driveway.

     INT. NEIL'S HOUSE

     Kristen and Neil have finished a meal together and are sipping 
     wine.  Her hair is shorter.  Neil looks thinner, a little weary.

                              NEIL
               I'm glad things have worked out for you.

                              KRISTEN
               I think new York was just what I 
               needed.  So many people.  I never feel
               alone.

                              NEIL
                         (smiles)
               The city that never sleeps.
                         (pause)
               So what will you do now?

                              KRISTEN
               I don't know.  I'm busy with school.
               New friends.
                         (beat)
               But I'll never forget the old ones.

                              NEIL
                         (raises his glass)
               To old friends.  And your new dreams.

                              KRISTEN
               To old friends.

     Neil is at the door, seeing Kristen off.

               It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad
               you dropped by.

                              KRISTEN
                         (pauses at her car)
               Do you still...see each other?

                              NEIL
                         (strange little smile)
               Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.

     Kristen nods.  She knew it.

                              KRISTEN
               Will you say hi?
                         (he smiles that he will)
               Good night.

     INT. HOUSE

     Neil closes the door.  He's alone in the empty house.  He turns 
     out the lights and trudges slowly upstairs.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Neil in bed, drifting off to sleep.  The tight, weary look is gone 
     from his face -- he looks peaceful, contented.

     PAN TO the paper mache model of the Elm Street House.  It's 
     different now -- clean and pure and inviting.  A lovely little 
     place, in fact.

                                                      FADE OUT

                              THE END
