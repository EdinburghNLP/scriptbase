THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

               THE LOST WORLD
                JURASSIC PARK

               Screenplay by
                 David Koepp
     
               based on the novel by
               Michael Crichton

     EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

     A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
     tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
     sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

                    ISLA SORNA
          87 miles southeast of Nublar

     Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
     picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
     laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
     decanters with red and white wine.

     PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
     reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
     surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
     once, supervises the settings of the table.

     She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
     years old, wandering off down the beach.

                    MRS. BOWMAN
          Cathy!  Don't wander off!

     Cathy keeps wandering.

                    MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
          Cathy, come back!  You can look for
          shells right here!

     Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

                    BOWMAN
               (eyes still in his book)
          Leave her alone.

                    MRS. BOWMAN
          What about snakes?

                    BOWMAN
          There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
          her have fun, for once.

     FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

     Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
     parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

                    CATHY
          Please be quiet, please be quiet
          please be quiet...

     Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
     behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
     turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
     sand.

     A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
     swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
     which abruptly stops moving.

     A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
     along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
     tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
     It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

                    CATHY
          Well, hello there!

     The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
     down on her haunches.

                    CATHY (cont'd)
          What are you?  A little bird or
          something?

     She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

                    CATHY (cont'd)
          Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

     The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

                    CATHY (cont'd)
          Come on.  I won't hurt you.

     The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
     of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

     -- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
     under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
     easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
     it.

     Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
     hand, calling back over her shoulder.

                    CATHY (cont'd)
          Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
          I found something!

     She turns back.

     Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
     standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
     feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

     She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
     have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
     and CHIPPING as they surround her.

                    CATHY (cont'd)
               (terrified)
          What do you guys want?

     BACK ON THE BEACH,

     the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

                    MRS. BOWMAN
          Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

     From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
     from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
     pierce the air.

                    MRS. BOWMAN
          PAUL!

     She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
     his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
     to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

     DOWN THE BEACH,

     Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
     in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
     frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
     Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
     horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

     Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
     YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
     EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
     monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
     sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
     lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
     ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
     hint that everyone's been here a long time.

     A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
     down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          The hurricane seemed like a disaster
          at the time, but now I think it was a
          blessing, nature's way of freeing
          those animals from their human
          confines.  Of giving them another
          chance to survive, but this time as
          they were meant to, without man's
          interference.

     The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
     and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
     image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
     up to the end of the table.

     And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
     in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
     around him.

                    HAMMOND (cont'd)
          There are some corporate issues that
          are not about the bottom line.  We
          have so much still to learn about
          those creatures.  A whole world of
          intricate, interlocking behaviors,
          vanished everywhere -- except for
          Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
          is good for more men at the expense
          at what is best for all mankind.

     The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

     He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
     anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
     Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
     eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

                    LUDLOW
               (an accent similar to
                Hammond's)
          These pictures were taken in a
          hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
          hours ago, after an American family
          on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
          B.  The little girl will be fine, but
          her parents are wealthy, angry, and
          very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
          hardly new to us, is it?
               (takes a paper from the
                file)
          Wrongful death settlements, partial
          list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
          million dollars; family of Robert
          Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
          destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
          Demolition, de-construction, and
          disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
          organic and inorganic, one hundred
          and twenty-six million dollars.  The
          list goes on, gentlemen -- research
          funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
          expensive.

     He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          This corporation has been bleeding
          from the throat for four years.  You,
          our board of directors, have set
          patiently and listened to ecology
          lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
          your checks and spent your money.
          You have watched your stock drop from
          seventy-eight and a quarter to
          nineteen flat with no good and in
          sight.  And all along, we have held a
          significant product asset that we
          could have safely harvested and
          displayed for profit.  Enormous
          profit.

     He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
     sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
     them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
     replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
     and Tourists look on in wonder.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          Enough money to wipe out four years
          of lawsuits and damage control and
          unpleasant infighting, enough to not
          only send our stock back to where it
          was but to double it.  And the one
          thing, the only thing standing
          between us and this asset is a
          born-again naturalist who happens to
          be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
          for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

     Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
     Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          "Whereas the Chief Executive
          Officer has engaged in wasteful and
          negligent business practices to
          further his own personal
          environmental beliefs --
          Whereas these practices have 
          affected the financial performance
          of the company by incurring
          significant losses --
          Whereas the shareholders have been
          materially harmed by these losses --
          Thereby, be it resolved that John
          Parker Hammond should be resolved from
          the office of Chief Executive
          Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
          Chairman, I move the resolution be
          put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
          a second?

                    BOARD MEMBER
          I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
          Please poll the members by a show of
          hands.

     The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
     bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

                    CHAIRMAN
          All those in favor of InGen Corporate
          Resolution 213C, please signify your
          approval by raising your right hand.

     It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
     up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
     his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
     the TV screen.  It goes blank.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

     Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
     of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
     Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

     The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
     barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
     and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
     dangling from his lips.

                    DIETER
          Yeah.

     He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
     smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

                                   CUT TO:
     INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

     Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
     underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
     COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

     A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
     as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
     before they meet --

     -- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
     is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
     There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
     there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
     doesn't care.

     INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

     MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
     He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
     across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
     Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
     approaches.

                    MALCOLM
               (under his breath)
          Shit.

     The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

                    MAN
          You're him, aren't you?

                    MALCOLM
          Excuse me?

                    MAN
          The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
          on TV.
               (conspiratorially)
          I believed you.

     No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

                    MAN (cont'd)
          Roooooarr.

                    MALCOLM
               (a withering look)
          I was misquoted.  I was merely
          speculating on the evolutionary
          scenario of a Lost World.  I never
          said I was in any such place.

     He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
     Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
     across from him are staring at him.

     He looks at them.  They looks away.

     He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
     to hide.

     INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

                    BUTLER
          Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
          calling?

     MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
     Avenue apartment.

                    MALCOLM
          Ian Malcolm

     A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
     It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
     lunges --

     -- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
     The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
     Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
     
                    BUTLER
          Not an animal lover?

                    MALCOLM
          Not really.

     INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
     bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

     Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
     the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
     us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

                    HAMMOND
          Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
          like an ingenue, come in, come in!

     Malcolm steps further into the room.

                    HAMMOND (cont'd)
          It's good to see you.  It really is.
          How's the leg?

                    MALCOLM
          Resentful.

                    HAMMOND
          When you have a lot of time to think,
          it's funny who you remember.  It's
          the people who challenged you.  It is
          the quality of our opponents that
          gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
          never told you how sorry I was about
          what happened after we returned.
     
     Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
     hard to sustain anger.
     
                    MALCOLM
          I didn't know you -- weren't well.
          
                    HAMMOND
          It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
          finally killing me.
          
                    MALCOLM
          They do have motives.  Why did you
          want to see me?  Your message said it
          was urgent.
          
                    HAMMOND
          You were right -- and I was wrong.
          There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
          me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
          Instead of observing those animals, I
          tried to control them.  I squandered
          an opportunity and we still know next
          to nothing about their lives.  Not
          their lives as man would have them,
          behind electric fences, but in the
          wild.  Behavior in their natural
          habitat, the impossible dream of any
          paleontologist.  I could have had it,
          but I let it slip away.
               (pause)
          Thank God for Site B.
          
     Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
     
                    MALCOLM
          What?
          
                    HAMMOND
               (a spark in his eye)
          Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
          compact to you?
          
                    MALCOLM
          What are you talking about?
     
                    HAMMOND
          The hatchery, in particular?  You
          know my initial yields had to be low,
          far less than one percent, that's a
          thousand embryos for every single
          live birth.  Genetic engineering on
          that scale implies a giant operation,
          not the spotless little laboratory I
          showed you.

                    MALCOLM
          I don't believe you.

                    HAMMOND
          Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
          something for the tourists, Site B
          was the factory floor.  We built it
          first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
          miles from Nublar.

                    MALCOLM
          No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

                    HAMMOND
          After the accident at the park, a
          hurricane wiped out our facility on
          Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
          the animals to fend for themselves.
          And they did.  For four years I've
          fought to keep them safe from human
          meddling, now I want you to go there
          and document them.

                    MALCOLM
          Are you out of your mind?  I still
          have nightmares, my reputation's a
          joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
          need more of that?

                    HAMMOND
          It would be the most extraordinary
          living fossil record the world has
          ever seen.

                    MALCOLM
          So what?

     Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
     to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
     charts, maps and photographs.

                    HAMMOND
          I've been putting this together for
          over a year.
               (MORE)
          I have personal suggestions for your
          entire team, phone numbers, contact
          people.  They won't believe you about
          what they're going to see, so don't
          bother trying to convince them.  Just
          use my checkbook to get them there.
          I'll fund your expedition through my
          personal accounts, as such money and
          equipment as you need, but only if
          you leave immediately.  If we
          hesitate, all will be lost.

                    MALCOLM
          John . . .

                    HAMMOND
          You'll need an animal behaviorist,
          someone with unimpeachable
          credentials.  I believe you already
          know Sarah Harding.  She's got
          theories about parenting and
          nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
          bet she'd be dying to prove on a
          scale like this.  If you convince her
          to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
          she publishes, the scientific
          community must take it seriously.

     Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

                    HAMMOND
          Your documentation, you should use
          forensic photographic methods,
          Hasselbladt still cameras, high
          definition video.  When the trick
          photography analysts take your
          evidence apart, make it impossible
          for them to say there was enhancement
          or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
          this is very important -- avoid the
          island interior at all costs.  Stick
          to the outer rim.  Everything you
          need to know can be found there.
          Vindication lies on the outer rim.

     Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm not going, John.

                    HAMMOND
               (fatigue returning)
          Ian, you are my last chance to give
          something of real value to the world.
          I can't walk so far and leave no
          footprints; die and leave nothing
          with my name on it.  I will not  be
          known only for my failures.  And you
          will not allow yourself to go down in
          history as a lunatic.  You're too
          smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
          Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
          at redemption.  For both of us.
          There's no time to equivocate, we
          must seize it now, before --

     He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
     PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
     doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
     to Malcolm suspiciously.

                    LUDLOW
          Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

     Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
     him.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          Did I interrupt something?

     Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

                    MALCOLM
          Find someone else.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

     In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
     rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

                    LUDLOW
          So, you two were just, uh, telling
          old campfire stories, were you?

                    MALCOLM
          Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
          second that you and I don't know the
          truth.  You can convince Time
          magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
          of whatever you want, but I was 
          there.

                    LUDLOW
          You signed a non-disclosure agreement
          before you went to the island that
          expressly forbade you from discussing
          anything you saw.  You violated that
          agreement.

                    MALCOLM
          You cost me my livelihood.  That on
          which I relied to support my
          children.

                    LUDLOW
          If your university felt you were
          causing it embarrassment by selling
          wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
          see how I am to--

                    MALCOLM
          I didn't tell anything, I told the
          truth.

                    LUDLOW
          You version of it.

                    MALCOLM
          There are no versions of the truth!
          This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
          my life.

                    LUDLOW
          We made a generous compensatory offer
          for your injuries.

                    MALCOLM
          It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
          never--

                    LUDLOW
          InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
          Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
          its interests.  People will know what
          I want them to know when I want them
          to know it.

     Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
     foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
     one hand.  It's his cane.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          Don't forget that.

     Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
     and walks away.

     But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
     walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
     back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
     a determined CLICK.

     INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
     and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

     -- and picks up the file folder.

                    MALCOLM
          Do you have a satellite phone?

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

     ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
     hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
     African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

     It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
     but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
     safari who somehow found the local handout.

     They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
     eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
     eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

     Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
     up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
     person's name.

                    ROLAND
          Ajay?

     He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
     his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
     sneak up.

                    AJAY
               (delighted)
          How did you know?

                    ROLAND
               (taps his nose)
          That cheap aftershave I send you
          every Christmas, you actually wear
          it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
          down, what brings you to Mombassa?

                    AJAY
          You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
          last time you answered your phone?

                    ROLAND
          Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
          Why?

     Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
     One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

                    AJAY
          I got a call from a gentleman who's
          going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
          If he's to be believed, it's a most,
          uh, unique expedition.  And very
          well-funded.

                    ROLAND
          Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
          of a bitch.  You go.

     The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
     buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

                    AJAY
          But alone?  We always had great
          success together, you and I.

                    ROLAND
          Just a little bit too much, I
          think.

                    AJAY
          How do you mean?

                    ROLAND
          A true hunter doesn't mind if the
          animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
          there weren't enough escapes from you
          and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
          a bit less time in the company of
          death.  Maybe I just feel too close
          to it my--

     The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
     Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
     chair in a second.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
               (to Ajay)
          Excuse me.

     Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
     the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
     him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          You, sir -- are no gentleman.

                    TOURIST
          Is that supposed to be an insult?

                    ROLAND
          I can think of none greater.

     The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

                    TOURIST
          Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

                    ROLAND
          What do I have to do to pick a fight
          with you, bring your mother into it?

                    TOURIST
          Are you kidding?  I could take you
          with one arm tied down.

                    ROLAND
          Really?

     IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

     the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
     back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
     the man turns around.

     It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
     across from him.

                    TOURIST
          I mean my arm.

     POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
     reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
     both arms.

     Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
     to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
     spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
     sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

     BACK AT HIS TABLE,

     Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
     Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
     carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

                    ROLAND
          Sorry.  We were saying?

                    AJAY
          You broke that idiot's jaw for no
          reason other than your boredom.  Tell
          the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
          interested in knowing this
          expedition's quarry?

                    ROLAND
          Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
          look around the trophy room, and tell
          me what kind of quarry you think
          could possibly be of any interest
          to me.

     Ajay just smiles.

     EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

     The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
     seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
     the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
     world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
     long grass.

     The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
     stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
     grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
     its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

                    SARAH
          Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
          snout.

     Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
     outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
     of the hyenas to their prey.

     It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
     grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

     Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          They'll try to take down a calf.
          Come on.

                    MAKENA
          Closer?

     Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
     Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
     through it, trying to break it up.

                    MAKENA (cont'd)
          You know, we could see everything
          from up on the edge of that cliff.

                    SARAH
          No way.

                    MAKENA
          But the view would --

                    SARAH
          No cliffs.
               (into a pocket recorder)
          F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
          twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
          circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

     While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
     her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
     Makena follows, with growing unease.

                    MAKENA
          Sarah.

                    SARAH
          F8 circling north.  F1 straight
          through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
          stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
          through.  F8 angling through from the
          north.

     She's practically on top of the animals now.

                    MAKENA
          Dr. Harding.

     Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
     back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
     wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

     Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
     in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
     hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
     yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

     The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
     forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
     with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
     tape recorder.

                    SARAH
          Brooding behavior in evidence at the
          kill site, pups are ushered forward
          and adults help them eat, pulling
          flesh away from the carcass and--

     A telephone rings.

     Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
     thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
     of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
     pawing at a backpack.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
               (a frantic whisper)
          I thought you turned it off!

     Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
     Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          Yes?!

     Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          Ian.  This better be important.

     Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
     the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          When?

     INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

     Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
     end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
     MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
     talking on a satellite phone.

                    MALCOLM
          We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
          member team.

     Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
     make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
     Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
     is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
     engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
     trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
     subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

                    MALCOLM
          Eddie Carr's handling all our
          equipment and he'll be there to
          maintain it.  He's designing special
          field trailers now, top of the line
          mobile research units.

     EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

                    EDDIE
          No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
          you can't place that strut laterally,
          it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
          PLANS!

     From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
     next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
     back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

                    WORKMAN
          Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
          deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
          it

     Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
     constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
     up the phone and walks up, joining him.

                    MALCOLM
          Any damage?

                    EDDIE
          Minimal.

                    MALCOLM
          "Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
          light, it has to be strong --

                    EDDIE
          Light and strong, light and strong,
          sure, why not, it's only impossible.
          God save me from academics.

                    MALCOLM
          You are an academic.

                    EDDIE
          Former academic.  Now I actually make
          things.  I don't just talk.

                    MALCOLM
          You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

                    EDDIE
               (doesn't look at him)
          It doesn't matter what I think.

                    MALCOLM
          Is there anything we've forgotten?
          Anything at all?

     Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
     turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
     twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
     duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
     breaks into a wide grin.

                    KELLY
          Hi, Dad.

                    MALCOLM
          Kelly!  What are you doing here?

     She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
     in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

                    KELLY
          Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
          forget, did you?

     She pulls back and looks at him.

                    KELLY (cont'd)
          Did you?

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

     KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
     construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
     vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

                    MALCOLM
          Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
          an hour.  You only have to stay with
          her one night, she'll put you on a
          bus in the morning and your mother
          will be at the station when you get
          there.

                    KELLY
          I don't even know this woman.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
          She'll take you to the museum, maybe
          to a movie if you play your cards
          right.  You're going to have a
          fantastic time.

                    KELLY
          Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
          going?

                    MALCOLM
          I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
          within a week.

                    KELLY
          My vacation is over in a week.

                    MALCOLM
          I'll make it up to you this summer.
          I promise.

                    KELLY
          I'm your daughter all the time, you
          know.  Not just when it's convenient.

                    MALCOLM
          Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
          to say that?

                    KELLY
          No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
          once in a while.

     From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
          Dr. Malcolm!

     Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

                    MALCOLM
          Is that kid still bothering you?

                    KELLY
          Which one?

                    MALCOLM
          You know, at the bus stop.  With the
          hair?

                    KELLY
          That was about a year ago.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, is he?

                    KELLY
          No.  Richard talked to his parents.

                    MALCOLM
          That Richard.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
          Ian, come here a minute!

                    KELLY
               (to Malcolm)
          I could come with you.

                    MALCOLM
          Out of the question.  You'd miss the
          gymnastics trials.  You've been
          training for that for a year.

                    KELLY
          I don't care about the trials, I
          want to be with you.  I could be your
          research assistant, like I was in
          Austin.

                    MALCOLM
          This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
          about it.

                    KELLY
          You like to have kids, you just
          don't want to be with them, do you?

     He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
     impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
     heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
          what I can be.

     He leaves.

     INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

     While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
     background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
     the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
     mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
     watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
     trailer.

     INT. TRAILER - DAY

     Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
     divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
     The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
     dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
     monitors.

     Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
     processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
     equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
     slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

     She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
     Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
     ink.

     Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
     Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
     the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
     Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
     the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

     "The Five Deaths," it says.

     Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
     face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
     of those three ominous words.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

     The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
     five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
     with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
     Malcolm's team.

     ON THE BOAT,

     MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
     him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
     seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

                    JUTTISON
               (as the waves pound the
                boat)
          Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
          into the -- island?

                    MALCOLM
          Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
          Helicopters are too disruptive.
          These aren't piles of bones you'll be
          studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
          live, they breathe, and they react!

     Juttson looks at him skeptically --

     -- and throws up.

     AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

     NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
     twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
     photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
     HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

                    SARAH
          So what's your story, Nick?

                    NICK
          I was a cameraman for Nightline for
          six years, been freelance since '91.
          Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

                    SARAH
          That must be interesting.  What drew
          you there?

                    NICK
          Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
          in Greenpeace.

                    SARAH
          Very noble of you.
               (of the noisy Game Boy)
          You don't think you're bringing that
          thing onto the island, do you?

     Nick grins and shuts it off.

                    NICK
          Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
          woolly mammoths.

                    SARAH
          You think this is all a joke?

                    NICK
          Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
          keep a straight face when --
               (gestures to the
                black-clad Malcolm)
          -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
          going to Skull Island?

                    SARAH
               (not amused)
          Ian's a very good friend of mine.

                    NICK
          He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
          shrink.

                    SARAH
          I believe in him.

     But her face says even she has her doubts.

                    NICK
          Come on, there's only one reason any
          of us are here.  His check cleared.

     She looks at him.

                    SARAH
          Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
          pull it off while playing Donkey
          Kong.

     The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
     them.

                    CAPTAIN
          There it is!

     They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
     reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
     the fog-heavy ocean.

                    CAPTAIN (cont'd)
          Isla Sorna!

     The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
     mist swirls and encircles it.

     EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

     A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
     island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
     mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

     EXT. LAGOON - DAY

     Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
     Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
     nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
     of JUNGLE BIRDS.

     The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
     AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
     narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
     lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
     clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
     swapping its track for the animal's.

     MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

                    MALCOLM
          Be back in three days, but keep the
          satellite phone on and your radio
          tuned to the frequency I specified in
          case we need you sooner.

                    CAPTAIN
          Don't worry.  I've lived around here
          all my life, these islands are
          completely --

     In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
     large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

                    CAPTAIN (cont'd)
          -- safe.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

     The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
     just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
     island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
     shimmers in midday heat.

     EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
     flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
     along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
     aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
     color.

     As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
     begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
     structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
     the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
     tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
     lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
     from view.

     NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
     ground.  Malcolm notices.

                    MALCOLM
          Listen.  I know you all have probably
          concluded that I'm out of my mind.

     Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
     sway slightly?

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          That's all right, for now.  But just
          humor me and be careful.

     No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
     trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
     again.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          Even if you think I'm harmless and
          deluded, I promise --

     Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
     it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          -- this place is for real.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

     It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
     post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
     shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
     input.

     All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
     preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
     storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

     A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
     bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
     the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
     daughter.

     The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
     door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
     blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
     liquid.  We can guess.

     She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
     bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
     She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

     A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
     is heard.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

     Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
     a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
     chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
     beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
     trees to their right.

     At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
     carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
     beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
     urgent.

                    EDDIE
          Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
          subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

     He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
     containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
     with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
     tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

                    EDDIE (cont'd)
          I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
          purpurascens, the South Sea cone
          shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
          the world.  Acts within a
          two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
          than the nerve-conduction velocity.
          The animal's down before it feels the
          prick of the dart.

     From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
     walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
     along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

                    MALCOLM
               (to Eddie)
          Is there an antidote?

                    EDDIE
          Like if you shoot yourself in the
          foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
          dead  before you realized you'd
          accidentally pulled the trigger.

     Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
     stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
     them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
     trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
     defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
     and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
     movement --

     -- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
     along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
     three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
     stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
     break in the foliage.

     It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
     huge lumbering body.

     A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
     it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

     The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
     sticks there.

                    NICK
          Oh --

                    JUTTSON
          -- my --

                    EDDIE
          -- God!

                    SARAH
          It's beautiful!

     A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
     first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

     While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
     a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
     the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

     Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
     environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

     Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
     is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

     Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
     it breathlessly.

                    JUTTSON
          Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
          infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
          Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
          estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

     His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
     things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
     his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

                    SARAH
               (to Juttsn)
          That was a pair bond!  A family
          group, even, long after that infant
          was nestbound!

                    JUTTSON
          I want to see the nesting ground!

     Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
     wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
     smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
     Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
     continues on into the bush after the animals.

     IN THE BUSH,

     the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
     where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
     again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
     who is beside her.

                    SARAH
          Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
          see an egg clutch...

     She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
     glasses.

                    JUTTSON
               (whispering back)
          The empty shells are crushed and
          trampled.  The young stay in the
          birth environment, that's conclusive!

                    SARAH
          Not without a shot of the nest.

     She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
     parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
     using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
     other two.

     Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
     stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
     before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
     clearing.

     IN THE CLEARING,

     Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
     toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
     She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
     ever better as she gets closer.

     BACK AT THE HILL,

     the others can only watch her, aghast.

                    NICK
          She's gutty.

                    MALCOLM
          She's nuts.

     IN THE CLEARING,

     Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
     of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
     position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
     after picture from this ideal vantage point.

     She shoots the last picture on the roll --

     -- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
     down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
     hands.

     Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
     the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
     starts to move away, slowly.

     The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
     extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
     leaps back at the last second --

     -- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

     Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
     away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
     for animals their size.

     The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
     back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
     right up off the ground.

     It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
     across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
     looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
     hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

     The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
     HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

     Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
     surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
     first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
     into position behind the second.

     Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
     suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

     The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
     come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
     to the jungle floor.

     The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
     where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
     the animals!

     Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
     the jungle around them.

     The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
     and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

     There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
     underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

     A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

     the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
     with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
     throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

                    SARAH
          Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
          glad!

                    JUTTSON
               (out of breath)
          Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
          an apology.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

     Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
     seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
     and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
     to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
     blows it out.

                    SARAH
          No more smoking.  We leave no scent
          of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
          cologne, seal all our food in plastic
          bags.  We will observe and document,
          but we will not interact.

                    MALCOLM
          That's a scientific impossibility,
          you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
          principle.  Whatever you study, you
          also change.

     Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
     sharpie, to label it.

                    NICK
          What should I call this?  "Jurassic
          Pork?"

     Eddie, next to him, laughs.

                    SARAH
               (still to Malcolm)
          And let's forget about the high hide.
          We can't do this kind of work up in a
          tower, we need to be out in the
          field, as close to the animals as
          possible.

                    JUTTSON
          I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
          a family group, but there's never
          been anything in the fossil record to
          prove the carnivores did.

                    SARAH
          Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
          jackals, nearly all species of
          predator birds --

                    JUTTSON
          That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
          they could have been rogues.  Robert
          Burke certainly thinks they were.

                    SARAH
          We've got to see one to find out.
          Is there any --

                    MALCOLM
          No way.

                    NICK
          Oh, my God.

                    SARAH
          -- way we could safely --

                    NICK
          Oh, no!

     He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
     toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
     running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

                    EDDIE
          Fire!

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

     NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
     of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
     built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
     middle.

     Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
     from the trees behind him.

                    MALCOLM
          A campfire?!

     Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

                    SARAH
          No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
          use dirt!

     They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
     hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

                    MALCOLM
          Who the hell started a campfire?!

                    VOICE (o.s.)
          It was just to make lunch.

     Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
     the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

                    KELLY (cont'd)
               I wanted it ready when you got back.

     The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
     himself.

                    MALCOLM
          Oh ... man.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

     Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
     NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
     fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
     equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
     information-gathering equipment.

     MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

                    MALCOLM
          You know you were putting yourself in
          a potentially dangerous situation,
          but you didn't bother to find out
          how dangerous before you leapt in.
          You don't have the faintest idea
          what's going on on this island!

                    SARAH
               (loading a backpack)
          What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
          up for curiosity?  Where do you think
          she gets it?

                    JUTTSON
               (to Nick)
          Do you have chromium tapes?  The
          others fog in high-

                    NICK
          -humidity, I know.
               (waving a tape)
          Highest lead density on the market.

                    EDDIE
               (to Malcolm)
          We've got a lot of heavy marching
          ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
          anybody.

                    KELLY
          I can keep up.

                    MALCOLM
          You're going home.  I'm sending a
          radio call for the boats.  We'll all
          go down to the lagoon and wait for
          them.

                    SARAH
          Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
          high school vice-principal.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm her father.

                    KELLY
          Sure, now.

     Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
     and Kelly.

                    NICK
          Do you see any family resemblance
          here?

                    MALCOLM
          You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
          It's too dangerous.

                    SARAH
          If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
          any of us?

                    KELLY
          You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
          what's going on on this island.

                    MALCOLM
          How could you possibly?

                    KELLY
          Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
          else believed you, but I always
          did.

     He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

                    NICK
          The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

                    SARAH
          Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
          made two invasive landings in one
          day.  That'll have to go in any paper
          I write, and it will leave room for
          people to say our findings were
          contaminated.  You know the academic
          world as well as I do, once they
          smell blood in the water, you're
          dead.  Our presence has got to be one
          hundred percent antiseptic.  That
          means if we bend a blade of grass, we
          bend it right back the way it-

     A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
     BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
     shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
     military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
     island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
     fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

     AT A RIDGE,

     the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
     over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
     specific spot.

     Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

     DOWN BELOW,

     huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
     cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
     anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

     Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
     parachutes billowing open behind them.

     UP ON THE RIDGE,

     Nick looks at Sarah.

                    NICK
          You were saying something about
          antiseptic?

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

     Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
     to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
     barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
     HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

     PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
     wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
     surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
     pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

                    LUDLOW
          Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
          Burke.

     Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
     he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

                    BURKE
          I believe the large herbivores forage
          in open plains, like bison, which
          would explain the great variety of
          heat dots we're reading in the
          flatlands around this waterhole.
          Right -- here.

                    LUDLOW
          Then that's where we're going.

     Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
     times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
     underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
     container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
     icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
     dashboard.

                    BURKE
               (calling them off)
          Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
          Maiasaurus!

     As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
     man we saw welding earlier.

                    LUDLOW
          This is as good a place as any for
          base camp.  First priority is the
          laser barriers, I want them all up
          and running in thirty minutes.  Half
          an hour, understand?

     Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
     twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
     front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
     hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

                    ROLAND
          Cancel that, Dieter.

                    LUDLOW
          What?  Why?

     Roland points to a stream running nearby.

                    ROLAND
          Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
          you want to set up base camp or an
          all-you-can-eat people bar?

                    LUDLOW
               (thinks)
          You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
          spot.  And remember, we're after
          herbivores only -- no unnecessary
          risks.

     Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
     Ludlow and pulls him aside.

                    ROLAND
          Peter, if you want me to run your
          little camping trip, there are two
          conditions.  First -- I'm in
          charge, and when I'm not around,
          Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
          checks, tell us we're doing a good
          job, and open your case of scotch
          when we have a good day.  Second
          condition -- my fee.  You can keep
          it.  All I want in exchange for my
          services is the right to hunt one of
          the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
          only.  Why and how are my business.
          If you don't  like either of those
          conditions, you're on your own.  Go
          ahead and set up your camp right
          here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
          of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
          I've been on too many safaris with
          rich dentists to listen to any more
          suicidal ideas.  Okay?

                    LUDLOW
               (what else can he say?)
          Okay.

                    ROLAND
          Good lad.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE

     The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
     Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
     STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
     "speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
     the wheel beside him.

     LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
     ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
     look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
     stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

     In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
     front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
     around the front of the car and sees --

     -- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
     jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
     animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
     a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
     heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
     Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

     Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

                    BURKE
          Pachycephalosaurus!

                    LUDLOW
          Carnivore?

                    BURKE
               (enchanted)
          Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
          Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
          eater, see that distinctive domed
          skull?  That's nine inches of solid
          bone.

                    LUDLOW
               (who cares?)
          Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

                    DIETER
          COME ON, MOVE IT!!

     The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
     chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
     them, they go back to their grass.

                    DIETER (cont'd)
          Oh, for God's --

     He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
     closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
     second jeep.

                    ROLAND
          Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
          war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

     Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
     slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
     not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

                    DIETER
          Come on, come on, don't have all
          day!

                    BURKE
               (going on to no one in
                particular)
          See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
          bottom of its skull instead of the
          back of its head, as with reptiles.

     The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
     intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

     -- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
     of the way.

                    BURKE (cont'd)
          So when it lowers its head, its neck
          lines up directly with its
          backbone --

     BEHIND DIETER,

     Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
     takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
     toward Roland.

                    AJAY
          Roland.

     UP AT THE FRONT,

     the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
     the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
     "look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
     time to see --

     -- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
     the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

                    BURKE
               (concluding his lecture)
          Which is perfect for absorbing
          impact.

     Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
     pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
     AT HIM.

     Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
     protect himself.

     SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
     against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

     In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
     out the window for a better look, laughing.

     POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
     bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
     Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
     speedbird.

     But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
     forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
     speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
     vehicle.

     Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
     Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
     car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
     MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
     vastly amused.

     A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

     Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
     animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

                    AJAY
          It matches the pictures.

                    ROLAND
          It certainly does.

     Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
     pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
     Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

     -- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
     .600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
     immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
     bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

     The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
     bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
     breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
     shirt pocket.

     Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
     these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
     He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

     Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
     trashing the speedbird for the first time.

                    ROLAND
          HEY!

     The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
     HISSES sharply between his teeth --

     -- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
     of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
     calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
          up.

                    LUDLOW
          Where do you think you're going?!

                    ROLAND
          To collect my fee.

     And with that he disappears into the foliage.

     The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
     battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
     DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

     IN THE JUNGLE,

     Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
     angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
     lead.

                    ROLAND
          Ajay.

     Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
     footprints lead.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          I'm no tracker, but even I can read
          this spoor.

                    AJAY
          Do you wish to go where the animal
          has been, or where the animal is?

     Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
     follows.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

     Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
     plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
     being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
     as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
     vehicle below.

                    EDDIE
          Why didn't you tell us about these
          guys, Ian?!

                    MALCOLM
          Because I didn't know!  I don't have
          the faintest idea what they're doing
          here.

                    NICK
               (angry)
          Ruining everything, that's what
          they're doing.  You could choke on
          the diesel smoke already!

                    SARAH
          Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
          if we're trailing along in the wake
          of an army.

     Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
     they move below.

                    KELLY
          "InGen."  What's InGen?

                    MALCOLM
          Where does it say that?

                    KELLY
          On the side of that one truck.

     Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

                    JUTTSON
          InGen is a genetics corporation,
          isn't it?

                    NICK
               (to Malcolm)
          Is that who we're really working
          for?!  Gene splicers?!

                    MALCOLM
          No!  We're an independently funded
          expedition.

                    SARAH
          Funded by whom?

                    MALCOLM
          John Hammond.

                    JUTTSON
          But he's the head of InGen!

                    NICK
          You gotta be kidding.
               (to Malcolm)
          You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
          be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
          get anybody else?

                    KELLY
          Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

                    SARAH
          We'd better keep moving, or we'll
          lose them.

     The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
     through the binoculars.

                    MALCOLM
          What are you doing to me, John?

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

     AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
     into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
     the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
     far left.

     Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
     breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

     He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
     can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
     black interior.

     Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
     sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
     crawling with white maggots and flies.

     Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
     skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
     still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

     Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
     they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
     SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

     Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
     rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

     -- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
     feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

     A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
     center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
     its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
     scraggly appearance.

     It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
     chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
     teeth.

     The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
     the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
     bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
     WHISPERS.

                    ROLAND
          It's the rex nest.

     Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
     up, cocking its head in curiosity.

                    AJAY
          Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
          to return?

                    ROLAND
               (shakes his head no)
          If the nest is upwind, so are we.
          When he comes back, he'll know we're
          here before we have a chance.  The
          truck --

     In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          -- is to get him to come where we
          want him.

     The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
     down at it.  Thinking.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

     As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
     pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
     below the ridge.

     In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
     herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
     and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
     
     MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
     beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
     pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
     ridge.

     THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

     We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
     binoculars whip to the right --

     -- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
     fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

     There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
     mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
     wrangler's pickup truck.

     Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
     almost eerily silent.

     ON THE RIDGE,

     Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
     the sun FLARES off the lens --

     EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

     -- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
     the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
     in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
     vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

     The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
     thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

                    HUNTER
          LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

                    HUNTER 2
          THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
          BEAUTIFUL!!!

     One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
     others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
     long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

     He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
     the driver.

                    DIETER
          FASTER!

     The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
     on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
     to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

     -- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
     them off, herding them back out into the open.

     BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

     PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
     the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

                    LUDLOW
          Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

     BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

     the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
     thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
     lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
     continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

                    LUDLOW (o.s.)
          Those are very expensive animals!
          Can you hear me?!

                    DIETER
               (to the Driver)
          Turn that off!

     The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
     rifle from the back of the vehicle.

     THE MOTORCYCLE

     guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
     plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
     necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
     bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

     The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
     scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
     massive legs.

     One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
     cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
     the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
     the apotosaurs.

     The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
     apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
     juvenile.

     Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
     High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
     cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

     He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
     neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
     a lasso around its neck.

     They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

     As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
     look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
     the truck.

     As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
     hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

     Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
     scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
     this dino-contaiment vehicle.

     Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
     the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
     between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

     The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
     and it takes off, back into the hunt.

     BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

     Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
     whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
     jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

     Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
     seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

     Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
     herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

     BANG!!

     The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
     its left hindquarter.

     UP ON THE RIDGE,

     there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
     the spectacle below.

     DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

     the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
     cloud of dust and dirt.

     The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
     his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

     The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
     CLANGS heavily to the ground.

     FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
     the ramp and out of the truck.

     Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
     gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
     Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

     The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
     while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

                    DIETER
          Easy -- easy -- not too close!
          Full extension!

     The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
     feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
     foot tall animal.

                    DIETER (cont'd)
          Now!

     Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
     stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
     their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

     UP ON THE RIDGE,

     Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

     DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

     a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
     end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
     to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

     Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
     the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
     glowing.

     The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
     Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
     and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

     A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
     carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
     horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

     DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
     syringe.

     He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
     injects it into the animal's thigh.

     CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
     and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
     orange.

     Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
     dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
     the animal.

                    DIETER
          Next case.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

     Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
     established base camp in an area they have trampled and
     cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
     perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
     central campfire.

     The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
     At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
     containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
     have already rounded up.

     SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
     looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
     from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
     VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

     DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
     the cages.

                    JUTTSON
          Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
          triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
          or small scavengers only.

     Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
     something below.

     THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

     he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
     pointing, giving orders.

     ON THE RIDGE,

     Malcolm drops the binoculars.

                    MALCOLM
          Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
          such a hurry for me to get here.  He
          knew they were coming.

     He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          You okay?

                    SARAH
               (irritated)
          Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
          arm here, will you?

     She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
     close to the cliff edge.

                    JUTTSON
          What do they want?

                    MALCOLM
          They want their money back.  To
          InGen, this island is nothing more
          than a bed investment.

                    JUTTSON
          We should get back to base camp.
          Eddie's waiting for us.

                    MALCOLM
          I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
          running all this.

                    SARAH
          He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
          past the fire.

     She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

     THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

     Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
     equipment slung over their shoulders.

                    SARAH (o.s.)
          I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
          and that guy with him were
          spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
          immoral to go after them any other
          way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
          philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
          you up with your own argument.

     BACK ON THE RIDGE,

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          He's the one in charge.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, if that's true -- the man in
          charge just left camp.

     Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
     forward.

                    NICK
          Then this is our chance.

                    MALCOLM
          Our chance to do what?

                    NICK
          I don't know these guys, but I know
          'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
          whalers, French barges trying to dump
          barrels of nuclear waste in the North
          Atlantic.  They're all the same.
          They spray us with water cannon when
          we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
          and then call us crazy.

     He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
     hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

                    NICK (cont'd)
          Nobody has to come with me.  I've
          done this before.

                    SARAH
          Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

     He looks at her, hurt.

                    NICK
          There' no reason for name calling.

                    MALCOLM
          Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
          to camp right away.  Leave the other
          car for us and we'll meet you there
          in an hour or so.

                    KELLY
          What are you guys gonna do?

                    MALCOLM
               (signs)
          Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
          to do.

     INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

     In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
     sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
     PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
     bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
     it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
     protest.  Roland looks up.

                    ROLAND
          Offering a little incentive.

     Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
     offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
     gun leaning against a tree.

                    LUDLOW
          What kind of gun is that?

                    ROLAND
          My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
          in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
          him after he took down his last
          elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
          force.

                    LUDLOW
          How close do you have to be?

                    ROLAND
          Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
          it'll take a slug in the brain case
          to bring him down.

                    LUDLOW
          Why not just use a scope and a poison
          dart and snipe him from a hill?

     Roland just looks at him.

                    ROLAND
          Or a laser beam from a satellite?

     Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
     while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
     with a leather strap.

                    LUDLOW
          You rally think this'll draw the
          parent?

                    ROLAND
          I once saw a bull elephant die
          charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
          done was startle the bull's calves.
          I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
          four and a half miles, all the way
          back to its den, just to teach its
          cubs how to finish off a kill.

                    LUDLOW
          Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

                    ROLAND
          Rex won't be any different.  It'll
          come.

                    LUDLOW
          You're kidding yourself.  An adult
          T-rex cares about one thing --
          filling its own belly.  It acts the
          way people wish they could, that's
          why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
          people had the chance to see one
          dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
          percent would --

     He stops, an idea on his face.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
          growth inhibitors...

                    ROLAND
          What?

                    LUDLOW
          I hadn't planned on bringing
          carnivores back because of the
          liability risk, but I only thought of
          adults, it never occurred to me --
               (close to the animal)
          You are a billion dollar idea, my
          little f-

     CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
     lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
     bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
     clutching his bleeding face.

     Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
     Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
     leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
     pain.

     Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
     is done.

                    ROLAND
          What the hell you do that for?!

     As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
     to cover.

                    LUDLOW
          Had to.  To keep him still for the
          trip.

                    ROLAND
          You've broken its leg!

                    LUDLOW
          We've got to transport it seven
          thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
          bit off the leg of a crew member?

     He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
     trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

     At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
     scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
     barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
     the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

     Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
     steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
     CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
     left alone on the other side.

     He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
     springs off his good leg --

     -- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
     with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

     FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

     the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
     barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
     directly behind the row of vehicle.

     They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
     the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
     under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

     UNDER THE JEEP,

     Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
     along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

     -- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
     stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

     MALCOLM AND SARAH

     move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
     from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
     hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
     to the third.

     From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
     high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
     direction.

     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

     It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
     ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
     form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

     They wait.

     Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
     all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
     scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

     EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

     Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
     all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
     parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
     area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

     The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
     drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
     partiers visible as they move inside.

     They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

     -- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
     tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
     glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
     row of fine bristling.

     And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
     triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
     trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

                    NICK
          Hang on.  We may encounter some
          turbulence.

     INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

     In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
     satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
     day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
     There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
     photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

                    BURKE
          If you're really interested in
          infants, we'll have better luck at
          the seaside, because the sands offer
          a cushioning surface where the egg
          clutches can -- can --

     He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
     the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

     They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
     someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
     hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
     turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

     -- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

     EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

     HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
     tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
     SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
     confusion, chaos reigns.

     In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
     SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
     in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

     The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
     through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
     INTO FLAME.

     Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
     directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
     ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
     hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
     across the camp.

     The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
     Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
     one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
     its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

     The jeep explodes.

     OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

     Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
     fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

                    ROLAND
          What in God's -- !

     BACK IN THE CAMP,

     the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
     camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
     the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
     animals.

     AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

     Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
     bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
     direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

     The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
     in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

     Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
     series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
     fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
     him, spinning to a stop --

     -- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

                    ROLAND
          Last time I leave you in charge.

     OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

     Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
     Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
     chained to the stake.

                    NICK
          Sick bastards.

     He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
     leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
     the stake out of the ground.

     BACK IN THE CAMP,

     Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
     several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
     the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
     scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
     smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

                    LUDLOW
          What in Christ's name is going on?!

                    ROLAND
          Isn't it obvious?

     He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

                    NICK (cont'd)
          We're not alone on this island.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
     green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
     of the car.

                    SARAH
          Nick, thank God, we didn't know
          if --

     Malcolm opens the rear door.

                    NICK
          Wait, don't ---

     With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
     of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
     just short of Malcolm's nose.

                    MALCOLM
          HOLY SHIT!!

     He SLAMS the door.

     DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

     Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

                    ROLAND
          Do we have anyone up there?

     BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

     Malcolm is confronting Nick.

                    MALCOLM
          ?!

                    NICK
          It has a broken leg!

                    MALCOLM
          So do it a favor and put it out of
          its misery!

                    NICK
          No!  Get in the car before they hear 
          us!

     He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
     into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
     but the rear.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
     car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

     INT. AAV - NIGHT

     The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
     flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
     animal as possible.

                    SARAH
          Ian, close the window, it's going to
          wake every predator in the jungle!

     Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
     window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
     legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

     Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

     EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

     Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
     standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
     returning comrades.

     Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
     as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
     hundred yards away.

                    JUTTSON
          There they are!

     They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
     them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

                    EDDIE
          What is that they have with them?

     EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

     SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
     arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
     arm, isn't far behind.

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
     table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

                    MALCOLM
          This is exceedingly unwise.

     Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
     small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
     baby's injured leg.

                    SARAH
          Too late to worry about that!  Hold
          him together, Nick!

     Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
     injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

                    MALCOLM
          Just do whatever you have to do and
          get it out of here as quickly as
          possible.

     Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
     the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
     a monitor next to the table.

                    SARAH
          Okay, there's the metatarsals --
          tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
          it?  That's a fracture, just above
          the epiphysis.

     They peer closely at the monitor.

                    NICK
          That little black line?

                    SARAH
          That little black line means death
          for this infant.  The fibula won't
          heal straight, so the ankle joint
          can't pivot when he stands on his
          hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
          run, and probably can't even walk.
          It'll be crippled, and a predator
          will pick it off before it gets more
          than a few weeks old.

                    MALCOLM
          Can you set up?

                    SARAH
               (thinking)
          It has to be temporary, something
          that'll break apart and fall off as
          the animal grows...

                    MALCOLM
          Think fast, Sarah.

     The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

     EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

     Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
     trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
     clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

                    KELLY
          What are they doing?  Why don't
          they hurry?!

                    EDDIE
          Give me the radio.

     From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
     SHRIEK --

     One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
     into the night jungle.

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
     around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
     MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
     thrashes again.

                    NICK
          Give it more morphine!

                    SARAH
          We'll kill it with too much, we'll
          put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
          almost done.  Damn it, I need
          another adhesive, something pliable I
          can --

     Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          Spit!

     He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
     rex CRIES OUT again.

     EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

     From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

     And this one's closer.

     In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
     the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
     tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
     coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

     But it's not the wind.

     They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
     section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
     bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

                    KELLY
          What is it?

     Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
     her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
     walkie-talkie.

                    EDDIE
          Sarah, come in!

                    JUTTSON
          It's moving.  Fast.

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
     The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
          Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

     On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
     into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
     regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

                    SARAH
          Hold it down, Nick!

                    NICK
          I'm trying!

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
               (from the radio)
          Is anybody there?!

     Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

                    SARAH
          Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
          and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
          of antibiotics and I can get it out
          of here!

     Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
     comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
     cc's of the pink liquid.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
               (still from the radio, now
                desperate)
          SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME!

     They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
     injection.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
          WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE
          TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW!

     EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

     Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
     desperately.

                    EDDIE
          WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED
          IN YOUR DIRECTION!  I REPEAT --

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
     piece of information.

                    MALCOLM
          Oh, Christ.

     He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

     A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
     followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
     to the window, just in time to see --

     --  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

     There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
     response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
     TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

     Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

     The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
     baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

     But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
     HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS.

     This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
     anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

                    NICK
          What do they want?!

                    MALCOLM
          What do you think they want?!

                    SARAH
          That's impossible, they can't have
          the sensory equipment to track it all
          the way here!

                    MALCOLM
          Current evidence seems to be to the
          contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
          TO THEM!

     Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
     earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
     into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
     fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

     Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
     trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
     stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
     through the window.

     EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
     illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
     adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
     as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
     watching their infant.

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

                    SARAH
          Ready?

     Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

                    NICK
          Wait!

     He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
     camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
     breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

     Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
     surprised.

     Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

                    SARAH
               (softly)
          Born free, as free as the wind blows.
          As free as the grass grows --

                    MALCOLM
          Are you insane?!

                    SARAH
          I swear to God, it works with lions
          sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
          is free --

     The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
     ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
     shut.

     The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
     can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
     inspect their young --

     -- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
     as they move away.

     From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

                    EDDIE
          They're going back into the jungle.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT

     EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
     high hide.

                    EDDIE
          Thank God.  Thank God.

     MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

                    MALCOLM (o.s.)
          Kelly?  Are you all right?

     She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

                    KELLY
          Uh huh.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     MALCOLM is at the radio.

                    MALCOLM
          Wait there.  I'll come up in a
          minute.  Don't move, understand?

                    KELLY (o.s.)
          I understand.

     Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
     NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
     completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
     speaks shakily into it.

                    SARAH
          Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
          rex does nurture its young.

     They laugh weakly.

                    NICK
          There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
          rule when a news crew is in a war
          zone.  You stop the van every two
          miles and decide whether or not to go
          on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
          One "no" from anybody in the group
          and you turn around right there, no
          question asked, nobody embarrassed.
               (pause)
          Well?  Do we go on?
     Immediately:

                    SARAH
          No.

                    MALCOLM
          No.

                    NICK
          No way.

     They all laugh.

                    MALCOLM
          All right.  I'm satisfied with the
          evidence we have right now.
          I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
          too.
               (to Sarah)
          Do you have enough to publish?

                    SARAH
          They will come after me.  But I can
          collect some stool samples, for DNA
          with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
          of you to back me up, it should stand
          when we get back.

                    MALCOLM
               (getting up)
          Then the only thing left to do is
          make sure we do get back.  I'll
          call the mainland on the satellite
          phone and have them send the boat
          right now.  This expedition is over.

     He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
     phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
     lights up, a brilliant green.

     But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
     VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

                    EDDIE (o.s.)
          Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

     Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

                    MALCOLM
          What the hell is he sorry f-

     A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
     Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
     RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
     everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

     -- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

     They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
     earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
     and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

     The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
     against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
     glowing green.

     Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
     the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
     revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
     trailer!

                    NICK
          HANG ON TO SOMETHING!

     They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
     for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
     trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
     quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
     entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

     Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
     and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
     everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
     everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

     But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
     sliding forwards.

     SEEN FROM OUTSIDE,

     the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
     trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
     front of it.

     IN THE TRAILER,

                    SARAH
          They're pushing us!

     Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
     He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
     as they move past it.

     He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
     they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
     outside the window.

                    MALCOLM
          Oh, God.

                    SARAH
          What?!

                    MALCOLM
          They're pushing us over the cliff.

     Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
     muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
     them look at each other for a moment --

     -- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
     trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
     starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
     accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER,

     which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
     it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

     IN THE REAR TRAILER,

     Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
     Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
     starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

     The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
     freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

     Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
     starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
     getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
     latch, doesn't open.

     Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
     Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
     hundred feet below.

     The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
     box strains on its power cord.

     Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
     to come loose, swaying above her.

     The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
     shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
     contents.

     Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
     trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
     rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

     FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW,

     an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
     tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
     breaking window.

     IN THE TRAILER,

     Nick SHOUTS to her.

                    NICK
          SARAH!  DON'T MOVE!

     Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
     senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
     For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
     she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
     She blanches; the world spins around her.

                    SARAH
          OH... GOD ... please...

     Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
     up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

     But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
     more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
     whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
     trailer.

     UP ABOVE HER,

     Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
     balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
     glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

                    MALCOLM
          Nick!  Grab the phone!

     SARAH

     looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
     wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
     hand to reach for the grating with the other.

     NICK

     reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
     from his outstretched fingers.

     SARAH

     leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
     around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
     splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
     of the frame --

     -- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
     pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
     glass.

     NICK

     has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
     shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

                    NICK
          SARAH LOOK OUT!

     SARAH

     lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
     heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
     opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

     UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER,

     glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
     fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

     IN THE CLEANING,

     the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
     straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
     cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
     back into the jungle.

     IN THE TRAILER,

     Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
     lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

     ON THE CLIFFSIDE,

     we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
     corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
     out from the muddy cliff.

     But now those branches SPLINTER.

     IN THE TRAILER,

     Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
     stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

     BELOW HIM,

     Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
     inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
     purchase.

     OUTSIDE,

     the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
     again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
     like a Slinky.

     INSIDE,

     Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
     built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

     But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
     gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
     the jungle as fast as he can.

                    EDDIE
          Hang on -- hang on --

     The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
     revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
     him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
     rex and SKIDS to a halt.

     INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

     Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
     frame of the half-broken rear window again.

     OUTSIDE,

     Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
     SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

                    EDDIE
          HEY!  HELLO?!

     IN THE REAR TRAILER,

     The three look up from their precarious positions.

                    MALCOLM
          WE'RE IN HERE!  GET SOME ROPE!

     OUTSIDE,

     Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
     rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
     trailer.

     IN THE REAR TRAILER,

     Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
     into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
     into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

                    EDDIE
          Catch!

     The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
     dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
     trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

                    SARAH
          We're sliding!

                    EDDIE
          Climbs up if you can!

     OUTSIDE,

     Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
     dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
     trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

     He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
     front grill.

     Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

     Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
     behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
     its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

     -- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
     cable.

                    EDDIE
          Damn it!

     INSIDE THE TRAILER,

     Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
     bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
     further up, also clinging to the rope.

     OUTSIDE,

     dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
     edge of the cliff.

     Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
     and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
     THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND!

     Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
     securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
     toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

     But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

     IN THE TRAILER,

     Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
     Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
     them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
     they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
     the remains of the rear window.

     Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
     now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
     dangling over the rocky shore below.

     IN THE JEEP,

     Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
     get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
     trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
     it there.

     ON THE CLIFFSIDE

     Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

     IN THE JEEP

     Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
     engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
     ROAR, in the distance.

     And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
     GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

     Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
     mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
     the jungle behind him.

     He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
     OTHER REX racing toward him.

     The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
     The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
     lifts the car to its teeth.

     But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
     Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
     the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

     Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
     away.  The gas pedal pops up --

     -- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

     But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
     The trailers stop.

     Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
     who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
     SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
     exposed.

     He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
     teeth and tossing him out of the car.

     Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
     heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
     disappears between their teeth.

     Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
     trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

     INSIDE THE TRAILER,

     Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
     the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
     trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
     hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

     ON THE CLIFFSIDE,

     the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
     who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
     Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
     is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

     It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
     below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
     surf.

     EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

     It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
     cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
     SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
     NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
     the edge.

     They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

                    MALCOLM
               (softly)
          Eddie?

     He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
     their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

                    SARAH
          Oh, God.  Now what?

     From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
     moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
     would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
     them.

     The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
     with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
     JUTTSON along in front of him.

     Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
     together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
     as he possibly can.

                    MALCOLM
          Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

                    KELLY
          I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
          thought you, are you okay?!

                    MALCOLM
          I'm fine... I'm fine...

     Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

                    ROLAND
               (mostly to himself)
          That's what you think.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT

     In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
     the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
     heated argument.

     MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
     just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
     something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
     than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
     SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

                    LUDLOW
          Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
          to jail just for being here, did
          you know that?

                    SARAH
          Don't start a legal argument with me,
          this island isn't your property, and
          neither are these animals!

     DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

                    JUTTSON
          What are you doing here, Burke?
          There's no TV cameras, what's the
          point?

                    BURKE
          Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
          classroom.  I am amazed.

     Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

                    NICK
          Are you looking for a problem?

                    JUTTSON
               (an urgent whisper)
          Everyone, keep your voices down!

                    ROLAND
          Back off, Dieter.

                    JUTTSON
          Listen to me, by moving the baby
          rex into our camp, we changed the
          adults' perceived territory!

                    LUDLOW
          Their what?

                    SARAH
               (she understands)
          Oh, God.

                    JUTTSON
          That's why they persisted in
          destroying the trailers, they now
          feel they have to defend this entire
          area!  We're not safe here.

                    LUDLOW
               (of Sarah and Nick)
          Thanks to you people.

                    SARAH
          Hey, we came here to observe, you
          came here to strip-mine the place!
          It's a looter mentality, all you care
          about is what you can take.

                    ROLAND
          None of that matters.  Our
          communications equipment's been
          destroyed.  If your radio and
          satellite phone were in those
          trailers that went off the cliff, and
          I'm guessing by the look on his
          face --

     He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
     stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
     grimness of their situation sinks in.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          We are stuck here, ladies and
          gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

     Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
     groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
     dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
     containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
     a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
     shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
     remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
     equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
     paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
     a cartoon of Marlboros.

     ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
     displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
     MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
     him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

                    ROLAND
          If we can't stay in the rex's
          territory, we have to move tonight.

                    SARAH
          Move where?  Our boat's not coming
          for two days, your airlift is waiting
          for an order you have no way to
          send --

     Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
     photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

                    LUDLOW
          There's a communication center, here,
          in the old worker village.  Hammond
          put in some kind of renewable power
          source replenishing.  It may still
          work.  If we could get there, we
          could send a radio call for the
          airlift.

                    NICK
          How far is the village?

                    LUDLOW
          I said if we could get there.

                    NICK
          Well, how far is it?

                    LUDLOW
          A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
          the problem.

                    ROLAND
          What is?

                    LUDLOW
          The velociraptors.

     Malcolm looks up sharply.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          Our infrareds show their nesting
          sites are concentrated in the island
          interior.  That's why we planned on
          keeping to the outer rim.

     Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
     something to her quietly in the background.

                    DIETER
          What are velociraptors?

                    JUTTSON
          Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
          feet long, three or four hundred
          pounds, and very, very fast.

     Dieter brandishes his weapon.

                    DIETER
          I think we can handle ourselves
          against them.

     Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
     low.

                    MALCOLM
          No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

                    ROLAND
          Look, we have two choices.  We can
          hike back down to the lagoon, where
          we can sit for two days, in the open,
          next to a heavily used water source
          while we're waiting for your boat to
          arrive, or we can head for the
          village, where we might find some
          shelter and we can call for help.

                    MALCOLM
          We'd never make it past the raptors.
          Trust me, I have some experience in
          this matter.

     Roland looks at him.

                    ROLAND
          That may be.  But you weren't with
          me at the time.

     Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
     Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          Load up.  Let's get this moveable
          feast underway.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT

     The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
     column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
     servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
     sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
     attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
     turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

     MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
     it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
     down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
     the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

                    MALCOLM
          Damn it.

     He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
     falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

                    ROLAND
          You all right?

     Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          Wrong question?

                    MALCOLM
          You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

                    ROLAND
          What's that?

                    MALCOLM
          A statistical phenomenon.  Says
          everything in the world goes in
          streaks.  It's real, you see it
          everywhere -- in weather, in river
          flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
          in stock markets.  Once things go
          bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
          things cluster.  They go to hell
          together.

                    ROLAND
          Feeling a bit blue, are we?

     Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
     and is a few steps ahead of them now.

                    MALCOLM
          Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

                    ROLAND
          Why did you come here?

                    MALCOLM
          So that others would know about this
          place?

                    ROLAND
          Why should they?

                    MALCOLM
          Because it exists.

                    ROLAND
          It'll still exit if they go on not
          knowing, won't it?

                    MALCOLM
          Yes.  And people will live in the
          absence of truth.

                    ROLAND
          So the truth is more important to you
          than your life?

                    MALCOLM
               (lowers is voice)
          I don't care about my life.  But if
          I'd ever thought for a second that
          she would be in danger --

     Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
     yards ahead now.

                    ROLAND
          She yours?

     AHEAD OF THEM,

     Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
     as far away as they think they are.

                    MALCOLM (o.s.)
          I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
          hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
          should have had her.

     Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

     BEHIND HER,

     Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          Why are you here?

                    ROLAND
          Somewhere on this island, there
          exits the greatest predator that
          ever lived.  And the second greatest
          predator must take him down.

                    MALCOLM
          But why?

                    ROLAND
          You remember that guy, about twenty
          years ago, I forget his name, but he
          climbed Everest without any oxygen,
          came down almost dead.  And they
          asked him, "why did you go up there
          to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
          went up there to live."

                    MALCOLM
               (nods)
          It's called self-testing.  But in
          your case, it sounds more like
          self-destruction.  A uniquely human
          characteristic.  In fact, human
          beings destroy things so well that I
          sometimes think that's our function.
          Maybe every few sons, some animal
          comes along that kills off the rest
          of the world, clears the decks, and
          lets evolution proceed to his next
          phase.  Maybe death and destruction
          are our job, maybe we're supposed
          to destroy ourselves and every other
          living thing that-

     Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
     staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
     by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

                    ROLAND
          Tell you what.  You can see whatever
          you want to, to me, but you will not
          spew any more nihilist rants at
          anyone else in the group.  I'm
          fighting panic, and you push the
          wrong buttons.  Understand?

     Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN

     As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
     stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
     are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
     worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
     swats his hand away.

     KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

                    KELLY
          I don't think -- my dad doesn't
          think we're going to make it.

     Sarah looks at her.

                    SARAH
          Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
          than he knows.

     She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
     The long march continues.

     UP AT THE FRONT,

     NICK catches up to ROLAND.

                    NICK
          I think you should call a break.

                    ROLAND
          Another half hour.

                    NICK
          Some of them won't make another half
          hour.  We didn't come this far to
          start dropping in the middle of the
          jungle.  If you don't call it, I
          will.

     Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

                    ROLAND
          FIVE MINUTES BREAK!

     Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
     drained.

     AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,

     DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

                    JUTTSON
          I can't believe you're still angry
          about that.

                    BURKE
          You know, it's very easy to criticize
          the first person who studies
          something.

                    JUTTSON
          No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
          research and hasty conclusions.

     NEARBY,

     MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
     still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

                    SARAH
          You know, even if we do get those
          tapes back, people are going to say
          it's just another hoax.  Ian
          Malcolm's alien autopsy.

                    MALCOLM
          Maybe.  Maybe not.

                    SARAH
          Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
          shoot holes in our testimony, and say
          some special effects genius created
          the animals.  The only way people
          will ever believe that dinosaurs
          exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
          middle of times Square.

     He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          There's something more important that
          you should be thinking about instead.

     BEHIND THEM,

     Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
     down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
     behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

     It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
     exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

     Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
     the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

     AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,

     DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
     the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
     CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

                    DIETER
          Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

     He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
     the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
     headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

     And he didn't hear a word.

     EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY

     Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
     so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
     forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

     He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
     hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
     didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

     Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

     -- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

     Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
     nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
     he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
     chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

                    DIETER
          It's not polite to --

     He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
     it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
     and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

                    DIETER (cont'd)
          -- sneak up on people.

     The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
     whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
     paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
     into --

     -- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
     or forward.

     He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
     took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
     with his hands, retracing his steps.

     He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
     that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
     stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

                    DIETER
          HEY!  CARTER!  YELL OR SOMETHING, I
          GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE!

     ON THE TRAIL,

     Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
     enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
     his ears.

                    DIETER (o.s.)
          ...Carter... me?...

     IN THE JUNGLE,

     Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
     right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
     foliage, moving faster and faster.

     Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
     ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
     his face.

     He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
     times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

     Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

     He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
     side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
     scrambles up into a sitting position --

     -- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
     the same as the one he wounded.

     For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
     his gun around, to point it at them.

                    DIETER
          Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

     As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
     covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
     each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

     Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
     Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
     SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
     on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
     the ground.

     Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
     shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
     seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
     drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
     which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
     feet from him.

     Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
     stopping ten yards away from him.

     But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
     and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

     Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
     compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
     lost weapon.

     Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
     He turns to face the pursuing compys.

     They stop.

     Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

     The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

     The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
     of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
     SQUEALING.

     Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

     The compys follow.

     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

     From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

                    ROLAND
          Break's over, move on!

     The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
     start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
     Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
     hoists his backpack, and marches away.

     Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
     trail.

     EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY

     DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
     stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
     stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

     Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
     just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

     -- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
     Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
     He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
     geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
     Dieter drops out of sight.

     The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
     throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
     CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
     SCREAMS.

     Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
     water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
     are pink.

     And then they're a deep, deep red.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

     The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
     MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
     CARTER.

                    ROLAND
          How long ago was this?

                    CARTER
          Seven, eight minutes.

     Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

                    ROLAND
          Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
          little girl.  Last thing we need is
          screaming hysterics.

     He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

                    SARAH
          We have to send someone to look for
          him!

                    ROLAND
          You go if you like, but we're not
          waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

     They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
     move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
     one by one.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK

     The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
     where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
     taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

     MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

                    MALCOLM
          You okay?

     She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
     sit over next to SARAH.

     Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
     makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

     AT THE RIDGE,

     ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
     interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
     way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
     miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
     gently undulating jungle.

     He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

                    ROLAND
          Looks like the worker village is down
          in there, about a mile and a half
          northeast from the base of these
          cliffs.

     MALCOLM is next to him.

                    MALCOLM
          There must be a game trail, some kind
          of path that goes down there.

     Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

                    ROLAND
          They'll have to rest before we look
          for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
          Then we hit it.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
     most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
     been put up.

     IN ONE TENT,

     KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
     to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

                    SARAH
          There you are.  Your dad's looking
          for you.

                    KELLY
          I doubt that.

     Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
     the broad red smear across its front.

                    SARAH
          Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

                    KELLY
          Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
          stay with you.

     IN THE CAMPSITE,

     all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
     the sleeping marchers.

     In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
     something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
     campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

     Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
     the camp.

                    ROLAND
          You hear something?

                    AJAY
          No.  I feel something.

     Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
     shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
     over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

                    ROLAND
          Oh, no.

     IN SARAH'S TENT,

     Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
     to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
     swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

     As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
     we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
     right -- it's blood.

     The baby T-rex's blood.

     AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

     the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
     that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

     He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
     the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

     Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

                    ROLAND
               (hisses)
          ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

     Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

     BMBB!

     Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

     IN SARAH'S TENT,

     Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

     BMBB!

     AT THE COCKING FIRE,

                    ROLAND
          Get my weapon.

     Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
     staring down at the ground.

     BMBB!

     A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
     impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
     circles spreading to the outer edges.

     BMBB!

     IN SARAH'S TENT,

     Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
     into Ziploc bags.

     BMBB!

     Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
     and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

     Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
     Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
     few inches, but --

     -- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
     sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
     tent.

     It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
     the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
     GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

     In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
     visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
     trying to figure out what this thing is.

     It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
     then rises, straights up --

     -- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
     ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
     away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
     beneath it.

     IN THE CAMPSITE,

     the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
     the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
     up.  Many of them start to run.

     Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
     lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
     T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
     into the mud.

     Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
     Hunters flee in all directions.

                    ROLAND
          FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!

     But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
     prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
     ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

     ACROSS THE CAMPSITE,

     NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
     to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
     rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
     the jungle.

     IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD,

     MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
     rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

                    MALCOLM
          KELLY?  KEEEEELLLY?!

     But he can't see her.

     AT THE EDGE OF CAMP,

     the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
     narrow ravine.

     UP ON A ROCK RACE,

     Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
     going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
     of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

                    ROLAND
          MALCOLM!  OVER HERE!

     Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
     scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

     Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
     camp toward him.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          FASTER!!

     Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
     rock face --

     -- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

     -- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
     pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

     The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
     his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
     turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
     after them.

     Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
     unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

     IN THE RAVINE,

     Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
     hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
     Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

                    MALCOLM
               (shouting)
          KELLY, UP HERE!

     But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
     now, and drawing closer to the group.

     Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
     ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
     of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

     The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
     head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
     Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

     -- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
     of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
     rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
     bottom of it --

     -- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
     the earth.

     UP ON TH ROCK FACE,

     Malcolm is frantic.

                    MALCOLM
          I gotta get down there!

     DOWN IN THE RAVINE,

     it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
     knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
     something off to his left.

     It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
     face.  But there's something about the way the water is
     falling that tells him something.

                    NICK
          SARAH KELLY COME HERE!

     He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
     at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
     the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

                    SARAH
          WHAT ARE YOU-

                    NICK
          JUMP!

     The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
     THROUGH the water.

     DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
     they vanish.

     BEHIND THE WATERFALL,

     there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
     It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
     for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
     Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

                    NICK
          Shhhh... shhhh...

     With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
     cascading water and crashes into them.

     Dr. Burke.

                    BURKE
          Get out of the way!

     He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
     water as he can.

     FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

     A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

     The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
     searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
     as far back against the wall as they can get.

     The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
     opening --

     -- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
     out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
     them, to pull them out of the cave.

     Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
     cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

                    SARAH
          STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP
          IT!

     But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
     himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
     a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
     each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

     Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
     water.

     And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
     tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
     teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
     waterfall, and disappears.

     Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
     water turn pink.

     UP ON THE ROCK FACE,

     Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
     with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
     nearly hysterical.

                    ROLAND
          She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
          she's okay!

     IN A JUNGLE CLEARING,

     routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
     jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
     long "elephant" grass.

     AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
     the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

                    AWAY
          NO!  DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!

     Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
     shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
     up at the edge of the jungle.

     Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
     judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
     the other Hunters, waving his arms.

     UP ABOVE THEM,

     Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
     of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
     as they plow through the grass.

                    ROLAND
          Elephant grass!

     ON THE PLAIN,

     the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
     One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

                    HUNTER
          They gave up!  They're not chasing
          us!

     There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
     VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
     on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
     arms madly.

     But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
     They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
     further away from the tyrannosaurs.

     ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY,

     the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
     the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
     party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

     BACK WITH THE HUNTERS,

     they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
     more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

     On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
     forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

     And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
     dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
     grass.

     In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
     drops its head to make the kill.

     Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
     animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
     RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

     -- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

     Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
     the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
     claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
     on attack.

     Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
     Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
     Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
     into the twitching long grass.

     Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
     past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
     and takes him down, into the grass.

     Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
     realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
     grass.

     Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

     Ajay simply closes his eyes.

     UP ON THE ROCK,

     Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
     LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
     decimated, spirits shattered.

     Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
     He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
     less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

     Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
     doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
     knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
     them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

     Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
     who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

                    ROLAND
          How many rounds did you find for that
          weapon?

                    MALCOLM
          Four, counting the one in the
          chamber.

                    ROLAND
          Don't let it out of your hands again.
               (to Sara, but looking at
                Kelly)
          Can the kid walk?

                    SARAH
          Ask her.

                    ROLAND
          Can the kid walk?

                    KELLY
          I can.  I can walk.

     While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
     servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
     your gaze.

                    ROLAND
          We're going to find a path down into
          the interior of the island.  Load up
          whatever you think you need, and I
          mean need.  If you can't carry it
          indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
          hit the worker village in a couple
          hours and be out of here before dawn.

     AT THE EDGE OF CAMP,

     Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
     rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
     slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

     Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
     a liquid of some kind.

     He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
     ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
     it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

                    LUDLOW
          What is that?

                    ROLAND
          Piss.

     Ludlow doesn't ask.

     NOW AT THE FIRE,

     Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
     to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
     in his pants pocket.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT

     ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
     wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
     come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
     wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
     moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

     SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
     one, they all stop and stare.

                    SARAH
          God help us.

     They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
     the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
     side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
     amazes them so.

     Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
     are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
     Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
     more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
     of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
     of carcass tossed in every direction.

                    NICK
          I do not feel lucky.

                    ROLAND
          Keep moving.

     They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
     skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
     carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
     HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

     He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
     footprints.

     FURTHER ON,

     Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
     fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

     He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
     they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
     graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
     objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

                    LUDLOW
          We made it!

     They hurry over a small rise --

     EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT

     -- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
     Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
     town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
     by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
     the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

     But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
     been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
     upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
     up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
     through the street, making it almost impassable.

                    MALCOLM
          The jungle.  It's always ready to
          return.

     Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

                    ROLAND
          Where's the power and radio setup?

                    LUDLOW
          Operations building.  Far end of the
          street.

     A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
     silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

     They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
     station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
     is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
     the group's gazes obediently.

     Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
     that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
     Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
     Nick looks over his shoulder.

                    NICK
          Lava?

                    MALCOLM
          No.

                    NICK
          What are they?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't know.

     Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
     the town.

                    LUDLOW
          The radio rig is inside.  It runs
          directly from the geothermal
          generator, so power shouldn't be a
          problem.

                    ROLAND
          Good.

     He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
     off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
     contents on the outside of it.

     The rest of the group just stares at him.

                    MALCOLM
          What's he got in there?

                    LUDLOW
          Piss.

                    SARAH
          What?

                    LUDLOW
          Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
          out to lunch.

                    NICK
          What in God's name would he want
          with-

     Roland rejoins them.

                    ROLAND
          Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
          anything to do with it, and neither
          does any other animal on this island.
          This building is now demarcated as
          the rex's territory.  As long as you 
          stay in that building, you'll all be
          safe until the helicopter comes.

     He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
     the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

                    JUTTSON
          Where are you going?

                    ROLAND
          After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
          back in the valley with tyrannosaur
          tracks all around it.  If I'm not
          back in time, don't wait for me.

                    SARAH
          You've got to be kidding.

                    ROLAND
          Runs against my nature to hole up in
          a cave and wait.

                    LUDLOW
          Do you think the rex might have the
          infant with it?

                    ROLAND
          Possible.

     Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

                    LUDLOW
          You know how to work a radio, don't
          you?

                    SARAH
          You're going too?

                    LUDLOW
          I lost everything I came after on
          this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
          park could single-handedly bail
          InGen out of Chapter 11.

     He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
     to Nick.

                    LUDLOW (cont'd)
          This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
          yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
          know what to tell 'em.

                    MALCOLM
          You gentlemen feel you have to do
          this now?

                    ROLAND
          Now's the perfect time.  The animal
          just fed, so it won't stalk us for
          food.  Predators don't hurt when
          they're not hungry.

     Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

                    NICK
          No.

     -- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

                    NICK (cont'd)
          Only humans do.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

     The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
     all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
     frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

                    NICK
               (into microphone)
          CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
          Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
          in, please.

     The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
     flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
     communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
     "We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
     of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

     On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
     Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
     tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
     at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
     true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

     There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
     at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
     radio, clean as can be.

                    VOICE (o.s.)
          Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

     They all breath a sign of relief.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
     group inside the operations building, main street stands
     deserted and silent.

     Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
     end of the street --

     -- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT

     ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
     amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
     down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
     saw earlier.

     A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
     carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
     follows Roland.

     As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
     surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
     washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
     his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
     sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

     He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
     from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
     that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
     then blow back at him.

                    LUDLOW
          We're downwind.  Good.

     Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
     his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
     shore.  Ludlow follows.

     They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
     and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

     Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
     ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
     bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
     to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
     the water as well, drinking.

     Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

     Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
     puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
     middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
     eyes blazing.

     Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
     well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
     Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
     reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

     Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

     FURTHER ON,

     the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
     Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
     Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

     To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
     A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
     green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
     WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

                    ROLAND
          We took to the rock.

                    LUDLOW
          Why?

     In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
     breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
     campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

     This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

                    ROLAND
          Wind shift.

     They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
     pebbled boulder --

     -- opens an eye.

     That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
     rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
     surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
     silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
     is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

     Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
     unaware of its presence.

     Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
     audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
     ever so slightly.

     Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
     voice a queasy HISS.

                    LUDLOW
          It's... behind... us.

                    ROLAND
               (the very softest whisper)
          It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
          it's threatened.  Don't move.

     As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
     these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
     hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

     He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
     he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
     of him, away from the rex.

     He risks another HISS.

                    LUDLOW
          If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

                    ROLAND
          Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

     Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
     its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
     great leg and takes a step into the trees.

     Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

     But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
     and drops to one knee.

                    ROLAND (cont'd)
          NO!

     The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
     squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
     animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

     Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
     the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
     jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
     up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
     it is firmly around his midsection.

     The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
     By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
     darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
     and writhing in its mouth.

     Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
     through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
     tyrannosaur is gone.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

     MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
     the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
     on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
     it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
     formica counter.

     Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
     CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
     shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

                    KELLY
          What's going on?!

     Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
     actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
     the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

     -- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

     As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
     violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
     heads.

     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

     Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
     roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
     impossible to land open.

     Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
     the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
     piercing the night sky.

                    PILOT
          There they are!

     The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
     overturned cars and fallen trees.

                    CO-PILOT
          No LZ in the street, too much debris!

                    PILOT
          Check the other buildings!

     The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
     the village.

     At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
     searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
     building.

     The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

     EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
     the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
     street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
     the building, to land on its roof.

                    MALCOLM
          There it is!

     Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
     the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
     everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
     they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

     This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
     of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
     occurs to her.

                    SARAH
          Ian.  It's guano.

                    MALCOLM
          What?

                    SARAH
          These formations.  They're dried --

                    MALCOLM
          Birdshit?

     A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

     They don't see it.

                    NICK
          Who cares?  Let's go!

     Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
     toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
     SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
     helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
     between them quickly.

     The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
     and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
     others, who fall like dominoes.

     Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
     as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

     Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
     SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
     She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
     hands --

     -- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
     legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
     first raptor in the kill.

     Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
     up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
     the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
     road.

     Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
     gone now.  He looks around frantically.

                    MALCOLM
          Kelly?!  KELLY?!

     Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
     nearest her.

     Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
     with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
     nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

     The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
     and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
     her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
     abandoned car.

     But the car door is thin protection against the charging
     raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
     spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
     ground.

     Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
     web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
     into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

     Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
     the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

     She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
     animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
     will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

     In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

     There's no windshield.

     The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
     the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

     -- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
     struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
     nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
     door.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

     MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
     station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
     later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

     Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
     window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
     SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
     its tail hanging out.

     Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
     out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
     Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

     -- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
     through the door again.

     Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
     window again.

     INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

     Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
     ready to spring at Malcolm.

     Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
     between them.  He raises the rifle.

     Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
     knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

     But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
     preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

     For the moment.

     EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

     Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
     He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
     unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

     ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
     his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
     commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
     the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

     Malcolm scoops them up.

                    NICK
          Come on!

                    MALCOLM
          Where's Kelly?

                    NICK
          She's with Sarah!

     They race off, down the street.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT

     High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
     story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
     and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
     chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
     circles, wondering what to do now.

     From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
     sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
     SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
     the crack along the ground.

     ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR,

     the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
     tunnel underneath.

     INSIDE,

     Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
     starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
     ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
     it.

     Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

     With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
     hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
     hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

     At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
     moment.

     Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
     She starts to lower her body into it --

     -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER
     SIDE!

     Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
     grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
     climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
     its way inside, coming in through her hole.

     Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
     another.

     The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

     EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT

     A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
     shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
     can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
     searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
     approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
     street --

     -- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
     roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

     They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
     into the nearest building.

     INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT

     NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
     They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
     probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
     spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
     open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
     other, frantic.

                    MALCOLM
          We can't stay in here!

                    NICK
          We're sure as hell not going back out
          there"

                    MALCOLM
          This is single-wall construction!
          It's just a shack!

                    NICK
          It'll hold!

                    MALCOLM
          For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
          this!
               (RAPS on the door with his
                knuckles)
          You could-

     With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
     swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
     on the floor.

     A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
     weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

     Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

     SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
     it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
     raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

     Malcolm swings the gun around --

     -- the raptor lunges at him --

     -- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

     -- and the raptor lands on top of him.

     The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
     gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
     hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
     its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

     Malcolm pulls the trigger.

     The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
     its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
     violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
     hands as it falls and dies.

     Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
     wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
     budge.

                    NICK
               (helping him out)
          Head for the roof!

                    MALCOLM
          I have to find Kelly!

                    NICK
          I think she's with Sarah!

                    MALCOLM
          DAMN IT, BE SURE!!

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
     fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
     two feet from where she's hiding --

     -- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
     the street.

     Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
     hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
     only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
     the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

                    MALCOLM
          It's too wide!

     Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
     against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
     slack.

                    NICK
          Help me push this!

     Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
     pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
     direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
     building, THUDDING against it solidly.

     Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
     the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
     the gap, hand over hand.

     Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
     open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
     onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
     himself across.

     But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
     hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
     onto the roof.

     ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP,

     Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
     back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
     the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

                    NICK
          It's afraid to come onto the roof!

     Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
     and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
     concentric pattern.

                    MALCOLM
          Something's wrong.

                    NICK
          Look!  Sarah!

     He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
     Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
     face turns white.

                    MALCOLM
          SHE'S ALONE!!

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

     SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
     reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
     of the next building.

     She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
     sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

     -- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
     stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
     ahead of her.

     Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
     away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
     SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
     pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
     it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

     She looks over her shoulder, down --

     -- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
     building below.

     Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
     keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
     time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

     Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
     nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
     the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
     there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

     The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
     at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
     jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

     Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
     and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
     head, for all the good that does.

     But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
     edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

     The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
     slick roof.

     Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
     tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
     Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
     way as fast as she can.

     Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
     footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
     animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
     the tumbling tiles.

     Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
     hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
     roof, right past her --

     -- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
     attack one another.

     Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
     to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
     She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
     to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
     of their way --

     -- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

     INT. LAB - NIGHT

     Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
     lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
     light fixture.

     One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
     degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
     through a window.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT

     With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
     building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
     he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

                    MALCOLM
          Kelly!  KELLY!

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
     the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
     see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

     Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
     helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

     ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET,

     KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
     distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
     with fear, unable to move.

     The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
     outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
     is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
     in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
     entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
     looks up --

     -- into her father's eyes.

                    KELLY
          Dad!

                    MALCOLM
          Come on!

     He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

     ON THE ROOFTOP,

     Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
     leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

                    NICK
          Where's Kelly?

                    SARAH
          Where's Ian?

     Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
     street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
     speed down the middle of the street --

     -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM.

     DOWN IN THE STREET,

     Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
     They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

     Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
     SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

     They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
     struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

                    MALCOLM
          CLIMB!

     Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
     pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
     next one.

     Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
     much harder.

     Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
     shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

     Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
     She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
     on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
     running the balance beam.

     She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
     looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
     breathing hard.

                    KELLY
          DAD, COME ON!

     Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
     beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
     doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

     The raptor draws closer.

                    KELLY (cont'd)
          FASTER!

     Malcolm slips.

     One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
     trying to regain his tenuous balance.

     But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
     under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
     knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
     the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

     He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
     a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
     cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

                    KELLY (cont'd)
          DAD!

     She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
     the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
     feet above him now, with an open attack route.

     The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

     Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
     and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

     The raptor springs.

     Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
     peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

     The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
     both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
     hurtling into space.

     She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
     scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
     ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

                    KELLY
          GET UP!

     She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

     ON THE ROOF,

     Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
     from inside.

                    PILOT
          LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!!

     Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
     opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
     edge as well.

     Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
     animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
     they're surely done for this time, when --

     -- KA-BOOM!

     There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
     and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
     the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
     gunshot.

     It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
     smoking .600 Nitro Express.

     But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
     helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
     roof.

                    PILOT
          HURRY!  THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY!

     The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
     thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
     helicopter, loses her balance --

     -- as the roof caves in beneath her.

                    MALCOLM
          KELLY!

     She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
     building below.

     ONE FLOOR DOWN,

     Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
     roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
     an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
     arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
     substance drips off of it.

     It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
     oblong shapes.  Eggs.

     Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
     the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

                    MALCOLM
          Kelly!  I'm coming!

     Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
     is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

     IT'S A PTERANODON.

     Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
     brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
     saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
     stare, spellbound.

     Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
     its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

     ON THE ROOF,

     the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
     roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
     Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
     starts kicking at it, making it larger.

                    ROLAND
          Give me a ladder!

     IN THE PTERANODON NEST,

     Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
     SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
     SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
     middle of their clutch of eggs.

     An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
     Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
     and they start to climb out of the nest.

     ON THE ROOF,

     Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
     belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
     through the surface of the roof around them.

     The pteranodons are emerging.

                    MALCOLM
          GO GO GO GO GOG GO!

     The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
     abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
     there.

                    PILOT
          We're snagged on something!

     They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
     hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
     helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
     drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

     -- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

     IN THE HELICOPTER,

     the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
     the helicopter.

                    PILOT
          Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
          'em with the rotors!

                    SARAH
          NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

     They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
     animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
     chopper gains altitude.

                    SARAH (cont'd)
          They're protecting their nest.
          That's all.  That's all they're
          doing.

     Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
     each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
     against her father's chest, nothing left.

     He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

                    MALCOLM
          Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
          God for you...

     IN THE NIGHT SKY,

     over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
     hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

     As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
     pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
     sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
     silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
     lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

     Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
     the wine-dark sea.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT

     Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
     LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
     muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
     he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

     From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

     He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

     The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
     aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
     excitement as it toddles toward him.

     Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
     TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

     The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

     But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
     Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
     Watching.  Waiting.

     Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
     strikes, knocking him over again.

     Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
     and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
     tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

     -- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
     dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
     toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
     up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

     Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
     fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
     that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
     is an array of framed photographs --

     -- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
     Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
     distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
     face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
     winter setting around him.

     At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
     shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
     and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
     him.

     She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
     The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

     As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

                    MALCOLM
          Hello, Lex.  Tim.

     LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
     TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          This is Kelly.  My daughter.

     They nod their hellos.

                    LEX
          I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

                    MALCOLM
          I'm sorry about your grandfather.

                    TIM
          Thank you.

                    LEX
          We were going to call you, in a few
          days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
          and we've decided we want people to
          know about the island.  About what we
          all saw.

                    TIM
          We think it's something our
          grandfather would want us to do.

                    MALCOLM
               (pause)
          Why?

                    LEX
          Because it's true.

     Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

                    MALCOLM
          I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
          only ones who ever know, it'll still
          be true.  You see, I've decided
          that if the world found out about
          what your grandfather created, it
          wouldn't be around for very long.

                    LEX
          But -- it was real.  You can't let
          people go on saying it's not.

                    MALCOLM
          That's the thing about reality.

     He looks down at Kelly.

                    MALCOLM (cont'd)
          Even when people stop believing in
          it, it doesn't go away.

     Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
     interlocking with his.

     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

     Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
     moving lightly, as in a dream.

                    MALCOLM (V.O.)
          Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
          your face?  That's real.

     We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
     from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
     scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

                    MALCOLM (V.O.)
          Do you see the four of us, standing
          here together, alive?  That's real.

     A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
     positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
     position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

                    MALCOLM (V.O.)
          And maybe that's still that matters.

     The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
     approvingly up at the heavens.

                       FADE OUT
