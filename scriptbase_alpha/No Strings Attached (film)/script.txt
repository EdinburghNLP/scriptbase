          INT. PAVILLION CAMP . WEEHAWKEN-- IGHT-

          1994. A summer camp in- Northern Michigan. It's a dance. An
          over-enthusiastic counselor with a massive boombox stereo.
          Coolio's "Fantastic Voyage" blasts.

          About ten thirteen-year-old boys are lined up along the side.
          'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little
          versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano.

          They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle
          is KATIE, the blonde who grew boobs before anyone else. And
          every time she moves; she bounces.                 

                         

                         

                         
          The boys watch her, serious, concentrating. They need to
          remember this for later. Katie continues to bounce- One boy
          suddenly looks down, scared.

                         BOY
          It tickles.

                         OTHER BOY-
          Yeah. It does other stuff.
          But there's a boy on the, edge of the group : A sweet. face, 'and
          you wouldn't be surprised to- find but he's Jewish: A 12 year -
          old, Adam Kurtzman. He's the only boy not looking at Katie.
          Instead, he's staring off in another direction.

          On the other side of the dance floor, next to an 'enormously '
          fat kid, there's Emma. She's an awkward 12. Wearing borrowed
          clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she
          can't fill out. She's taller than any of the boys. But 
          there's something in her eyes, like she's laughing at
          everything.

          She makes eye,contact with Adam: She squints., He takes -a deep
          breath,. She squints some more. He walks over.-'.

                         ADAM
          Hey. -

                         EMMA
          Hey.
          A 'long' pause'. -They're not looking at each other. Then

                         ADAM
          Do you want to, freak?

          INT. PAV'ILLION-- MOMENTS LATER

          TLC's "No Scrubs." Emma and Adam are freaking awkwardly - Emma
          is too tall and Adam is holding on too tight and just
          bouncing up and down. -

                         ADAM
          You freak, good.

                         EMMA
          Okay.

                         ADAM
          - (singing along with the SONG)
           "No, I don't want no scrubs"--

          3.

                         EMMA
          I don't get it.'

                         ADAM
          Urn. She doesn't want a -scrub;
          Because he's hanging out of his.
          best friend's ride, trying to
          -holler at her.
          Katie, in another part of the dance floor, is in the middle
          of a big freak-sandwich.

                         KATIE

          CAMP RULES!
          Emma scowls at her, looks at Adam.

                         

                         EMMA
          Let's go to the dumpster-

                         ADAM

          But I feel like I've known you.my
          whole life.

          EXT. CAMP GROUNDS- NIGHT -

          Emma and Adam awkwardly stand against-the wall near the
          dumpster. There are couples on either side. of them making
          out.
          So.

                         ADAM
          I've enjoyed camp. There's all
          kinds of fun activities. For
          example, I learned how to-archer.

                         EMMA
          That's good. That'll be useful if 
          you ever make a time machine and go
          back'to the medieval ages:-and then
          your-time machine breaks, and you
          get attacked by knights.

                         ADAM
          You're funny. It's weird.

          teething, and I've just always
          associated it' with. pain in my gums.

                         - EMMA
          Um. "Man with a pink flower."

                         ADAM

          The painting is literally: A man with a pink flower.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         ADAM
          Do what? Spend time with each other'
          that doesn't involve ripping our
          clothes off, time that does't
          involve you texting me at 1 in'the
          morning and me running over like
          your little sexbunny-
          A nearby kid covers his mouth and starts giggling.

           No it's not! Maybe that's what You
           did with Vanessa or whoev er, but '
           that's not who I am, Adam. This
          stuff freaks me out.

                          ADAM

          ADAM (CONT'D).
          Someone told me recently that I
          look like Richard Nixon when I Gum.
          Adam does a little- imitation of what that looks. like. Emma

          And it suddenly became clear why
          none of my girlfriends ever wanted
          to have sex with me. I thought it
          was just because my dick was too
          big and it scared them-But
          apparently-that's not the problem.
          At all. Actually, I've heard it's
          like acupuncture- you're- on your
          back the whole time and you don't
          even feel it go in. That's what my
          ex-girlfriend told me before she
          started dating my father.
          Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her
          hand.

          We- have: a dog now. She named it

          about that.

          and you tell me what the hell's
          wrong with you and then I take you.
          fishing.

          ADAM,
          I'm completely in -love with
          someone, and I'm brainstorming ways
          that I can never see her again
          without ruining my life.',

                         ALVIN
          How'd.you get so screwed up?

                         (A BEAT)
          Oh yeah.-I did it.

                         ADAM
          I'm just like you- I'm going to
          fuck it all up. Like you. -Like you

          When ' we -first , had you, we hadn't
          slept in days, we were just shoving'
          food in our mouths over the sink
          whenever we could. And finally, I
          got it together enough to get. some
          take-out from one of the
          -restaurants we used to like.

          And I set it all out on,the table,
          and the second we sat down, I think
          it was the first bite I took, you
          started crying. And your Horn and I
          looked at each-other-and just

                         STARTED-LAUGHING- LIKE
          uncontrollably laughing., We're on
          the floor, we can't breathe.. that
          kind of laughing.

                         (A BEAT)

          So why'd-you start dicking around?'.
          Why'd you leave her?

                         ALVIN
          I don't know. I-think the. simplest
          answer is: I'm a jerk. And--the.
          other answer is: Because - at -some
          point, we forgot how to make each
          other laugh.. And if that-sounds
          like a bullshit answer, you're
          probably right. But if it 'sounds
          really deep, then - that-'s, good too.

                         (A BEAT)
          Alto.-just FYI- the first time I
          cheated .oft.' your mom, I. was on a lot
          of blow. So. if you're married and
          you. do blow, try to avoid-being
          -around women who wantto_fuck.you.
          Even fat women. Blow is-blind,
          Adam, blow is blind.

          I'm going to get you so 'much
          bacon...
          Thankfully,'we don't have to see that. Fade to black-as'we
          hear some amazing song, in my head it's "You'Ain't Goin'
          -Nowhere. ".


          THE END
