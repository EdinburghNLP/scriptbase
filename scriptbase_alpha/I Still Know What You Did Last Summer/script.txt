FADE IN:

TITLE SEQUENCE:

1     INT. BOSTON - OLD NORTH CHURCH - DAY

The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy
images of STAINED GLASS and lead.

FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.

REVEAL - JULIE JAMES

A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But
she's all alone in the house of the Lord.

And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
still rests upon her soul.

She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

2     INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.

A PRIEST

enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH.
Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.

               JULIE
     Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
          (a beat)
     It's been a year since my last
     confession...

Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     I've never told anyone this. Not my
     mom, not the poice, not even my
     friends -- except for the ones who
     were there and they...well they're
     not around anymore. You see I...I...

               PRIEST
     Yes?

               JULIE
     I killed a man. Well, I thought I
     had...then...

She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows
of the other side.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (emotional)
     You've got to understand...It was
     all an accident. A terrible accident.
     It's been a whole year. I've tried to
     get past this, but I just can't.

               PRIEST
     Go on...

               JULIE
     I have these dreams...horrible
     dreams. And this man is always there
     with me.

               PRIEST
          (reassuring)
     I know...

               JULIE
     You see, he was a killer. He
     murdered Helen and Barry, and he
     would have killed me too, if I
     hadn't...gotten away with it.
          (regathering)
     I don't know, I guess I just need to
     deal with the fear, the guilt...to
     finally say his name. Ben Willis. His
     name was Ben Willis...

The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,

               PRIEST
     I know...

Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her
body.

               JULIE
     You know? But how could you...

Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to
the screen, trying to get a better look.

               PRIEST
          (growls)
     I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!

A STEEL HOOK

smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

3     INT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
chair. She fights the unseen demon.

Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good-
looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her,
but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.

The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.

               PROFESSOR
     Nice to see you find Political
     Science so stimulating --

The lecture hall erupts with laughter.

               JULIE
     I'm sorry --

Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.

                                   CUT TO:

4     EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will
finally catches up.

               WILL
     Julie! Wait! You okay?

               JULIE
     I'm fine.

               WILL
     You sure?

               JULIE
     I'm fine.

               WILL
     You don't seem fine.

Julie realizes this is true.

               JULIE
     I had another dream, Will.

Will takes this seriously.

               WILL
     The shower again?

               JULIE
     It was in a church...it was so real.
     I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

               WILL
          (caring)
     I'm sorry.

               JULIE
     I thought I was over the dreams for
     good. I really did. I hadn't had one
     for months.

               WILL
     It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna
     get better.

               JULIE
     It can't get worse. I mean, it's not
     like this was the first time I
     freaked out in class. I hardly ever
     get a full night's sleep, my grades
     suck, I'm this close from being thrown
     out of school.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just
STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.

Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.

               JULIE
          (cont'd)
     It was one year ago...

               WILL
     It's...the anniversary. That's what's
     going on...Take it easy on yourself.

               JULIE
          (weary)
     I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I
     don't even know why I came up here in
     the first place.

               WILL
          (cheering her up)
     To get out of Southport?

               JULIE
          (softens)
     Right. Now I remember.

He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment
building.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Are you getting out of town on the
     fourth?

               WILL
     Nah. I'll probably just be here
     studying for finals. The joys of
     summer school...
          (beat)
     Are you okay?

               JULIE
     I'm okay.

               WILL
     Are you sure?

She touches his face affectionately.

               JULIE
     Thanks for the talk, Will. You're
     good to me.

Will stands there akwardly --

               WILL
     Um...Okay. Bye.

Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --

RAY

steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.

               JULIE
     Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.

Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.

               RAY
     I got in early. I was excited...
          (re: the receding Will)
     Who was that guy?

               JULIE
     Oh, that's Will. He's a friend.
     You'd like him.

               RAY
     Yeah.

               JULIE
     Ray, we're just friend.

               RAY
     Every guy in history who tried to
     pick up a girl did the good-friend
     thing first.

               JULIE
     Why are you being like this?

It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
they're miscommunicating.

               RAY
     Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are
     you ready to go? I've got the old
     truck. You know the drill...Crab
     boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen
     Pageant...It's only small-town fun,
     but it's still nice. People really
     miss you. I miss you.

She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --

               JULIE
          (softly, but resolved)
     Ray, I can't...

               RAY
     Can't what?

               JULIE
     I just feel like some part of me
     hasn't healed up enough to go back.
     Like some critical piece is missing.
     Please understand...

Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.

               RAY
     I understand something.

               JULIE
     It's not like that. It's not you.
     It's me. My head. I want to go back.
     I want to be with you. I want to be
     fine. I want everything to be like
     it used to be.
          (beat)
     It just isn't.

Ray is hurt and confused.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Hey, why don't you stay up here?
     They have fireworks over the river.
     And...there's a million things to do.

               RAY
     I have to work, Julie. My boat's in
     Southport, remember? But, I get it.
     You need your space from Craokerland.
     And maybe from me, too.

Ray starts walking away.

               RAY (cont'd)
     You know where to find me.

               JULIE
     Ray? Ray? At least come up for a
     while.

Ray keeps on walking.

               RAY
     It's okay. I'm just gonna go.

Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block
her way.

               JULIE
     Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
          (to herself)
     I'm just scared...that's all.

But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns
quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from
the keychain.

                                   CUT TO:

5     EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY


Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,
which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.

He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket
and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He
throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.

                                   CUT TO:

6     INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY

Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She
stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a
cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.

6A     INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the
lock on each window. She stands for a moment.

She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge
and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and
a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.
She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.

She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.

6B     INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely
furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the
windows, then climbs into bed with the food.

On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at
one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.

Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going
places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns
off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the
room.

                                   DISSOVE TO:

6C     INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.

There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.

Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the
front door being CLOSED.

Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb
POPS.

               JULIE
          (whispers)
     Okay. Okay. Face your fears...

She gets off the bed and stands still.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (whisper)
     There's nothing...

There's another NOISE down the hall.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (whisper)
     Quiet.

Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.

6D     INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the
living room. She steps through the kitchen door.

As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway
toward her bedroom.

6E     INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

There's NO ONE there.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Okay, calm down, imagination.

She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light
from the hallway slanting through.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     I can't take this anymore. I can't.

Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's
a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of
a drawer and starts down the hallway.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (fatalistic)
     Let's just do it.

She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.
It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.

6F     INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.

She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.

INT THE CLOSET

KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a
box of shoes. She SCREAMS.

Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and
flashlight.

               KARLA
     I thought you were out of town!

               JULIE
     What are you doing in my closet?

They hug, jumping up and down with relief.

               KARLA
     I thought you were out of town!

               JULIE
     What are you doing in my closet?

               KARLA
     i just wanted your black pants, but
     I'm not ready to die for them!

Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her
hand and black pants draped over her arm.

               JULIE
     That was heart attack time, Karla.

               KARLA
     No. When I put these skinny pants on
     my body...Now, that's heart attack
     time.

Karla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two
fingers --

               KARLA (cont'd)
     And we're going to put away the
     utensils and you're coming with me.

Julie flops down on her bed.

               JULIE
     I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,
     ugly, and depressed.

               KARLA
     Yeah, right -- whatever.

               JULIE
     I think I just really hurt Ray's
     feelings.

               KARLA
          (keeping it upbeat)
     Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great
     guy, nothing against old Ray, but
     he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in
     Southport. Will's a nice guy, too,
     and he lives right down the street.

Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet.

               JULIE
     There's nothing between Will and me.

               KARLA (V.O.)
     Yet. Nothing yet.

She emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     What we gotta do is keep moving. No
     time to mope. I'm working at the
     club tonight. And you, dancing queen,
     are coming with me.

               JULIE
     No I'm not.

Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.

               KARLA
     Fine, then be fat, ugly, and
     depressed.

Karla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the
dress when Karla hands it to her.

                                   CUT TO:

7     INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and
rivers of cheap booze.

AT THE BAR

Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.

A handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN,
23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.

               TYRELL
     You know what I want to do to you
     ...right now, don't you? There's
     gotta be somewhere we can be alone.

               KARLA
          (playful)
     I don't think so. It's pretty
     crowded.

               TYRELL
     Just for a minute, baby. I got
     something I wanna tell you.

He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.

               KARLA
          (teasing)
     If you can say all you gotta say
     in a minute then I don't wanna hear
     it.

               TYRELL
     I'll talk real slow.

He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.

The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.

               KARLA
          (re: Julie)
     Ask her to dance.

Tyrell hesitates.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Go on.

Karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to
Julie.

               TYRELL
     You're the most beautiful woman
     in the bar tonight, Jules.

               JULIE
     Tyrell, you are an unstoppable
     force of nature.

               TYRELL
     That's right. It's how the species
     survives. You'll never convince me
     otherwise.
          (beat)
     Wanna dance?

Karla passes by --

               KARLA
     Say yes.

               JULIE
     No.

               KARLA
     No means yes.

               JULIE
     Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have
     you seen my people dance? We make
     the mouth face, we move the
     fingers --

               TYRELL
          (heading for the floor)
     Worse comes to worse, you can stand
     there and watch me.

               KARLA
     Come on, I'll take a break and
     we'll all dance.

7A     INT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

is packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
Tyrell and Julie follow behind her.

Karla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin'
     fine.

               JULIE
          (suspicious, but
          having fun)
     Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?

               KARLA
     Nope. I told him that you
     absolutely, positively would not be
     here at this bar between ten o'clock
     and eleven o'clock tonight. And then
     he came anyway.

               WILL
          (shy to a fault)
     This was not my idea.

               JULIE
     What?

               WILL
     I said, this...Do you want a drink?

Will looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite
knowing what to do.

               TYRELL
     Where I come from, you want to
     snatch the goodies, you got to at
     least talk to them first.

Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie
alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.

               WILL
     How about a drink?

Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be
relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and
sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --

SOMEONE IN A SLICKER

watching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone.

               WILL
          (yelling over the din)
     You okay?

She's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is "Will I ever
have a normal time?" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.

               WILL (cont'd)
     Hey Julie?

Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.

7B     INT. THE CLUB - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Julie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER.

She pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.

7C     INT. THE CLUB - BALCONY - NIGHT

Julie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from
behind, making his way to the other side.

He slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He
turns down a service corridor.

Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.

She catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs
the stranger's arm.

               JULIE
     Ben...

The stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
raincoat and hat. She's shaken.

               SLICKER GUY
     Hye, baby. You following me up
     here?
          (a come-on)
     Well, all right.

Julie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his
figure quickly fades.

                                   CUT TO:

8     INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the
strange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the
room.

8A     INT. JULIE'S HALLWAY TO KITCHEN - DAY

The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.

ANGLE ON A CLOSET

The noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
yanks open the door.

ANGLE ON A CLOTHES DRYER

rocking and banging inside the closet. Julie frowns.

Julie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer,
flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
pop out on the fly.

               JULIE
          (still sleepy)
     That could break the machine.

               KARLA
     Julie, people who end up making
     rules like that end up beating
     their kids with wire hangers. It's
     a fact.

The phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     It's Tyrell.

               JULIE
          (resigned)
     The number's unlisted...

               KARLA
     Would you relax? We've been dating
     three months. He ain't stalking
     your butt.

               JULIE
     Okay, okay. You're right.

               KARLA
     I know it, and it feels good.
          (answering the phone)
     Hi, Ty.

A DJ for a local radio station BOOMS from the phone.

               MARK (V.O.)
     This is Mark in the Morning for
     Magic 96.7 Radio Station! Who am I
     speaking with?

Julie watches her friend get excited.

               KARLA
     Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh
     my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.
          (to Julie)
     Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.

               MARK (V.O.)
     Well, Karla, what're you doin' at
     home over the long fourth weekend?

               KARLA
     Well, I'm in school and --

               MARK (V.O.)
     How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7
     Quicky Getaway?

               KARLA
     Yes!

Julie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice
echos through the appartment.

               MARK (V.O.)
     Good, then I hope you remember your
     geography, Karla, because all you
     have to do to win is tell me the
     capital of Brazil.

Karla's smile abruptly fades.

               KARLA
          (into phone)
     Brazil? Um...

She looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     You don't know?! You have to know.
     You know everything...

               MARK
     C'mon, Karla, one easy question,
     one great getaway!

               JULIE
          (shrugs)
     ...South America...Carnival...

               MARK (V.O.)
     Karla, we need an answer. No
     looking it up.

               KARLA
     Still here...thinking...
          (stalling)
     You mean Brazil, the country?

               MARK (V.O.)
     Okay, Karla, five seconds.
          (counting down)
     Five...Four...

Julie has an idea. She scramles for the kitchen. Grabs a BAG OF FRESH-
GROUND COFFEE from the FREEZER.

               MARK (cont'd, V.O.)
     Three...Two...

Julie tosses the bag across the room to Karla. Karla reads the label:
RIO BLEND -- 100% BRAZILIAN COFFEE.

               KARLA
          (blurting)
     Rio de Janeiro!

               MARK (V.O.)
     Oh, no...Did you say Rio?

               KARLA
          (wincing)
     No. Yes?

BELLS and WHISTLES and triumphant MUSIC.

               MARK (V.O.)
     You just won Magic 96.7's Quickie
     Getaway...a trip for four to Tower
     Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas.

Karla and Julie jump up and down ecstatically.

               KARLA
     Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!

               MARK (V.O.)
     We'll call you back with all the
     details...So what's your favorite
     radio station?

               KARLA AND JULIE
     Magic 96.7!

Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch.

               KARLA
     I won. I won...I won, I won, I won.
          (teasing)
     Now, let's see...There's Tyrell,
     that's one. And, there's my parents
     ...And I got some cousins.
          (beat)
     Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark
     said four tickets. That means you
     gotta get yourself a date.

Julie thinks, she seems torn.

                                   CUT TO:

9     EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY

A SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its
way across the deck of a fishing boat.

WE PULL AWAY TO REVEAL it's RAY who's just done the dumping. A
coworker, DAVE, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from
the dock --

               DAVE
     Hey, Ray...phone!

Ray takes the phone.

WE INTERCUT.

               JULIE
     Hi.

Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious.

               RAY
          (beat)
     Hey. I'm really glad you called...
     I'm sorry.

               JULIE
          (compassoinate)
     No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm
     the one --

               RAY
     No, I shouldn't have left so fast...
     I was just...

               JULIE
     It's okay.

Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other
in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating --

               DAVE
          (as the fish)
     Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a
     humble fish, but if you really look
     at it, you're a fish, too.
          (girl voice)
     Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a
     snapper.
          (mashing the fish together)
     Hey, something smells like fish...

Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.

               JULIE
     Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas!
     An island called Tower Bay. And she
     wants us to come with her.

               RAY
     What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.

Dave's interest is piqued.

               JULIE
     We'd have a long weekend just to sit
     in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and
     swim, and...
          (sexy)
     You know...

               RAY
     This weekend?

Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens.

               RAY
          (hurt)
     You'll go away with you're college
     friends, but you won't go away with
     me?

               DAVE
     Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

Karla is watching Julie.

               JULIE
     It's not you, it's Southport. And
     it's the Bahamas! And it's free!

Karla is watching Julie.

               KARLA
     You gotta sell his butt on the
     Bahamas?

               JULIE
     Ray, come on. I want us to be
     together.

Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy.

               RAY
          (can't give in)
     Julie, we're working a big run up
     here. It's been crazy. We probably
     have to go out again tonight. I
     don't think I can do it.

               JULIE
     Will you try...for me, please?

Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.

               RAY
     Okay, I'll try. But, listen...
          (martyrlike)
     If I don't make it up, then you go
     ahead and have a great time.

               JULIE
     Ray...please try. I really miss you.
          (beat)
     Okay. Bye.

She hangs up and Karla sits next to her.

               KARLA
     That boy has got fish on the brain.
          (sensitive)
     Hey, cheer up, Charlie.
          (singing a rumba)
     We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama
     Mama, yeah...

10     EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY

Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is
staring at him in disbelief.

               DAVE
     Man, what is your problem? We
     haven't caught anything for days.
     Pull the big ugly stick out of
     your butt. She asked you to go to
     the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go.
     We'll both drive up. I got friends
     I can see up there.

Ray realizes how right he is.

               RAY
     Stupid. Stupid.

               DAVE
     Stupid. What were you thinkng?

Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
Dave walks over.

               RAY
     You wanna see what I've been
     thinking?

He holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.

               DAVE
     Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw
     the bomb.

               RAY
     I should go up there. I should call
     her back, tell her I'm coming.

               DAVE
     No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be
     psyched.

Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

11     EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

We stare out at a rain-soaked stretch of road.

A PICKUP ROARS past, cruising along with its RADIO loud and windows
rolled down.

12     INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

The music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going
to propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --

               DAVE
     Man, I love AM radio. You got
     right-wing conspiracy, tips for
     pregnant womem, Single-A baseball
     games, and real country music...
     None of that new crap...

He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "MAMAS, DON'T LET
YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS," by Waylon Jennings and Willie
Nelson.

Dave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.

               DAVE (cont'd)
          (singing)
     "...Mamas, don't let your babies grow
     up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick
     guitars and drive them old trucks. Let
     'em be doctors and lawyers and such."

Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
himself...

Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio.
They both stare --

RAY'S POV: A CAR TURNED SIDEWAYS

its HAZARDS blinking.

Ray slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It
appears EMPTY.

A BODY

is sprawled out in the road away from the car. Ray pulls over to the
shoulder and stops.

               DAVE
          (nervous)
     I don't know, man. Maybe we should
     keep going, find a phone --

               RAY
     No.

               DAVE
     The guy looks dead.

Ray has seen this before --

               RAY
     Maybe not.

He throws open his door.

12A     EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT

Ray steps from his truck. Looks back at the empty car, then turns
toward the body.

               RAY
          (nervous)
     Hey! Buddy, what's up?

The body doesn't move.

BEHIND RAY

and behind Dave, in the other car, a FIGURE IN A SLICKER sits up in
the back seat and gets out of the car.

Ray continues toward the body.

RAYS POV - BODY

FACE DOWN -- WEARING A BLACK RAIN SLICKER.

Ray moves closer to the all to familiar image.

BEHIND RAY

SLICKER FIGURE moves toward the unsuspecting Dave.

12B     INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

Dave watches Ray in the road. He leans across the seat and rolls up
Ray's window.

Behind him, the SLICKER FIGURE gets closer, moving to the passenger
side of the truck.

12C     EXT. MEDIAN - NIGHT

Ray nears the body. He kneels down.

               RAY
     Hey, can you hear me?

Ray reaches toward the body...

12D     INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.

12E     EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Ray turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back --

CLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN

Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck.

               RAY
     DAVE!

12F     EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT

Dave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN
jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE
CAR WINDOW.

               RAY
     ...Dave?

There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the
headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.

The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS.
The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.

Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.

Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked
car.

HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.

Ray backs around the car --

AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER

goes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way.

IN THE ROAD

Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to
go. Then, at the very last second,

RAY

jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT
WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES!

Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the
hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom
of a ravine.

                                   FADE OUT:

13     EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb.

A truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not
Ray.

Karla approaches her friend.

               KARLA
     Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.

Julie turns.

               JULIE
     He's not coming. I thought he was
     just...

               KARLA
     Julie, you left four messages...
     Four.

               JULIE
     But, he said he'd try.

               KARLA
     He said he'd try. Try is like maybe.
     Try is nothing!

               JULIE
          (appoligizing for him)
     He does work hard.

               KARLA
     Work hard, huh? He's breaking your
     heart just because he can.
          (hesitant)
     And I don't want to have to say I
     told you so...

               JULIE
     Then, don't.

A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing
shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.

               TYRELL
     Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or
     we gonna get tropical?

The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the
Jeep.

               JULIE
     Oh!

               KARLA
          (re: Will)
     Hey, sorry...
          (quick, playing it off)
     He's my friend, too. And that ticket
     is not going to waste.

Will reads Julie's expression.

               WILL
     Julie, is everything cool? Karla
     said...

               KARLA
     I said we start having fun. And that
     means now.

Julie takes a last look up the street. She stands.

               TYRELL
     Is there a problem here?

               KARLA
     Where there's a Will, there's a
     way. Come on.

               JULIE
          (deciding)
     You know what? This rocks. We're
     going to the Bahamas!

Will is relieved.

               KARLA
          (getting into the spirit)
     We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama
     Mama. We goin' Bahamas...

She bops over to Tyrell.

                                   CUT TO:

14     EXT. MIDAIR - DAY

A wide-body jet SCREAMS through the clouds.

15     INT. PLANE - DAY

A nearly empty jet. Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder. Julie is
reading a book.

Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his
eyes are clenched shut. Julie looks on with concern.

               JULIE
     Just take deep breaths and think of
     something happy from childhood.

               WILL
     What if I don't have anything happy
     from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax
     going five hundred miles an hour, or
     four thousand, four hundred feet a
     minute...
          (calculating)
     Which is over seven hundred feet a
     second. Imagine hitting something at
     seven hundred feet a second.

               JULIE
     Deep breaths --

               WILL
          (no deep breaths)
     Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
     You can by surface-to-air missiles
     over the internet. Planes use
     O-rings...which freeze in tap water.
     Planes fall from the sky for
     practically no reason at all.

               JULIE
     You've got a better chance of
     getting hit by lightning.

               WILL
     Right. Planes get hit by lightning.
     They get hit by meteors. They hit
     other planes.

Tyrell shakes his head.

               TYRELL
          (exasperated)
     Something is gonna hit your butt if
     you don't quit complaining.

               KARLA
          (sypathetic)
     Honey, some folks just can't fly.

Will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded
with the concerned Julie.

                                   CUT TO:

16     EXT. OCEAN VISTA - DAY

Establishing. A Board of Tourism kind of shot. Blue water. Green
islands. Golden sun. Puffy clouds.

A BOAT CHUGS by with the words "Tower Bay" painted on the side.

Tyrell THROWS UP over the side.

17     EXT. FERRY - DAY

More of a small tub than a ferry. Julie, Karla, Will, and Tyrell are
the only passengers.

At the bow, Julie and Karla laugh and play "King of the World." Julie
in the prow, Karla behind her.

               JULIE
          (deadpan)
     I'm the King of the World.

               KARLA
          (deadpan)
     No, I'm the King of the World.

They switch places. They look at each other and crack up laughing.
Karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day --

               KARLA
     Remind me to study real hard so
     someday this is normal and all that
     back there is somethin' I do for a
     weekend once every ten years.

               JULIE
          (sharing the moment)
     I will, and you remind me of the same
     thing.

They throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.

AT THE STERN

Will talks to a very green Tyrell.

               WILL
     You just gotta breathe.

Tyrell is trying to keep from puking --

               TYRELL
     Can't talk right now.

               WILL
          (slightly malicious)
     See, it's not a macho thing. It's
     about equilibrium in your inner ear.
     You could've used a patch, but it's
     too late now. Get used to it.
          (then)
     Some folks just can't sail.

PAULSEN, the BOAT CAPTAIN, overhears as he passes --

               PAULSEN
     That's too bad, too, because it's the
     only way on or off the island.
          (slightly ominous)
     Unless you have an accident. And then
     they call the Coast Guard.

Julie and Karla have rejoined the men.

               JULIE
     It's pretty remote here.

               PAULSEN
          (smiles)
     Yep. That's what the tourists pay for
     -- sun, sea, and solitude.

               TYRELL
     Are we there yet?

               PAULSEN
     Few more minutes.

We move off the boat and REVEAL the island. The intrepid vacationers
excitedly take in the island.

                                   CUT TO:

18     EXT. TOWER BAY - DAY

Establishing. An isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the
beach.

19     EXT. RESORT DOCK - DAY

The ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. A white-sand beach stretches in
every direction. Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the
world.

Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.

               TYRELL
     I feel like I'm still on that thing.

A dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies.

               DERRICK
     That way for a complimentary Planter's
     Punch to get you readjusted.

               TYRELL
          (mile-wide smile)
     I can get used to this.

Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the
process.

               DERRICK
     Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay.
          (a wink)
     I'm Derrick. At your service for the
     duration of your stay.

Julie smiles politely. Will gently nudges her on. They walk away.

               PAULSEN
          (to Derrick, mocking)
     I'm at your service, Princess.

               DERRICK
          (shrugs)
     Season's over old man. So I gotta
     work fast.

               PAULSEN
     If Marine Radio's right about the
     weather, you're already out of time.

He hangs a SIGN at the end of the gangplank. It reads: LAST DEPARTING
FERRY -- LINE FORMS HERE.

Our guys are already at the end of the dock.

                                   CUT TO:

20     EXT. TOWER BAY HOTEL - DAY

Establishing. An opulent, Carribean-style hacienda resort with all the
accoutrements.

The main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. A bell tower
rises from one side. And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by
suffocating fooliage.

Julie and Karla take in the beauty of the resort.

               KARLA
     Check it out.

TOW BIKINI GIRLS

catch the eyes of Tyrell and Will.

               TYRELL
     Yes, ma'am.

Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.

The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk
across a tiled plaza.

Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback,
racing each other toward the departure dock.

Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED
TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead.
And, on the right,

A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor
THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL
HOUSE.

A guy's unintelligible RASTA VOICE calls out --

               RASTA VOICE
     Anybudorsomethin'?

They turn to see TITUS, white guy, dreads, full-Rasta demeanor. He's a
phony, but sincere about it.

Titus approaches Tyrell --

               TITUS
     My brother, can I interest you in the
     islands finest ganja?

               WILL
          (teasing)
     Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother.

               TYRELL
          (wry)
     Not possible.

               TITUS
          (undetered)
     Who be wantin' the kind, the uber-
     sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge,
     the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your-
     Friends? Who wants it? 'Cause Titus got
     it.

               WILL
     No, thanks.

               TITUS
     Come on, man. Everybody wants something.

Will and Tyrell walk on. Undetered, Titus goes up to Karla and Julie.

               TITUS (cont'd)
     How 'bout you, ladies? Lovely ladies.

Titus moves his hips.

               TITUS (cont'd)
          (lascivious)
     Something I can do for you?

Karla looks him up and down, wrinkles her nose --

               KARLA
     Take a bath, maybe.

               TITUS
     That's cold, but if that's how you
     want it.

The group moves on. Titus watches them go --

               TITUS (cont'd)
          (yelling after them)
     Anybudorsomethin' you come and see me.

OMIT SCENE 21 & SCENE 22

                                   CUT TO:

A23     EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

Around TWENTY TO THIRTY GUESTS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT as Julie and the
others walk in. Julie smiles at an old PORTER helping the departing
guests with their bags. He doesn't smile back.

23     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor. AN ORNATE METAL
STAIRCASE leads UP to the ROOMS -- and DOWN (AS THE SIGN SAYS) TO A
FITNESS CENTER.

In one direction, the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical
RESTAURANT/BAR. And in the other, A LOOBY LOUNGE is visible --
surrounded by four walls of BOOKS and HOTEL MEMORABILIA.

In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed MAID named OLGA dusts off a
massive WOODEN GLOBE.

Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga
shyly looks away.

Arriving at the FRONT DESK, the four of them find it deserted. They
wait patiently, then impatiently.

ANGLE ON A DESK BELL

as Karla slaps it with her palm. The bell RINGS for a long time then
fades into SILENCE.

               KARLA
     Hello? Hello?

               JULIE
     Where is everyone? I'll ask --

Julie turns to consult the maid.

ANGLE ON THE GLOBE

The big ball is spinning. But Olga is no longer in sight.

Tyrell heads toward a DOOR beside the counter with a sign which reads:
PRIVATE OFFICE.

               TYRELL
     I'll scare somebody up.

He grabs the knob and pulls the door open to...

RROWWWR? A PIT BULL ON A CHAIN JUMPS UP INTO HIS FACE -- its toothy
maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose.

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     Whoa!

Julie and Karla laugh. Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- ONLY TO
HAVE HER HAND GRABBED IN THE PROCESS.

Karla gasps. Pulls away. We see the hand belongs to the hotel manager
-- BROOKS, balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he
won't share with guests.

               BROOKS
     What can I do for you?

               KARLA
     Checking in...Karla Wilson.

Will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby.

               BROOKS
          (condescending)
     Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet.
     Our contest winners are here at
     last.

He scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull.

               TYRELL
     Nice dog.

               BROOKS
     Not really. I've found peices of
     guys like you in his stool.

Tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.

               TYRELL
     What's your problem, buddy?

               BROOKS
          (innocent)
     I don't have a problem in the world.

               JULIE
          (covering)
     It sure is a beautiful old hotel.

               BROOKS
          (proud)
     Built in 1948 for a member of the
     Rockefeller clan. The tile work was
     imported from Spain. A lot of history
     in these walls...Judy Garland stayed
     here...Hemmingway fished for marlin
     right off that dock --

               TYRELL
     Okay, we get it...It's old.

               BROOKS
     It'll outlive you, I'm sure.

Creepy thing to say. Slides a registration form.

               BROOKS (cont'd)
     Wilson comma Karla...
          (sees something on
          the form)
     Oh --

               KARLA
     Oh, what?

Brooks covers --

               BROOKS
     You're in 201 and 202.

               KARLA
          (expecting this)
     Is that bad?

               BROOKS
          (lying)
     Not at all. Those are our honeymoon
     suites.

Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards
Will.

               JULIE
     Your what?

               BROOKS
     Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids
     haven't exchanged vows, yet?

               JULIE
     We haven't exchanged anything.

               KARLA
     Julie, we're talkin' suites!
          (excited)
     That'll be just fine with us.

               BROOKS
     And, while you're here, our marginally
     trained, off-season staff of five will
     attend to your every need.

               KARLA
     Wait...Did you say off-season?

               BROOKS
     July fourth weekend. Storm season
     starts today. The clouds roll in like
     clockwork.

               JULIE
     Storm season?

               BROOKS
     It's our version of winter.
          (hands over the keys)
     201 and 202. There's Scrabble and
     Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.

And Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their
rooms. Will catches up with them.

                                   CUT TO:

24     INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

They walk down the hallway. Karla seems annoyed.

               KARLA
     Ain't nothin' free in this world.
     Everybody says it, and it's true.
          (dissapointed)
     I wanted you all to have a good trip.

               TYRELL
     We will, baby...All this means is we
     got the whole island to ourselves.

               WILL
     And it's been blue skies all day. It
     might be perfect all weekend.

               JULIE
     It beets being on the mainland.

               KARLA
     Oooh, the mainland --

               TYRELL
     Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby.
     Tropical!

The mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts.

A BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the
weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it.

               ESTES
          (a Carribean accent)
     201 and 202...Who put you in...?
          (hesitant)
     Don't use these much --

               JULIE
          (suspicious)
     Why's that?

He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject.

               ESTES
     No real reason.
          (then)
     Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.

               KARLA
     We won a competition.

               ESTES
     Oh, yeah? What you have to do?

               TYRELL
     Guess the capital of Brazil --

               KARLA
     Rio, baby!

               ESTES
     Ahh, good for you, girl.
          (waiting for a cue)
     ...And, where would you like me to
     put the bags?

A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of
the keys to Julie.

               KARLA
          (to Estes)
     Their stuff in there...
          (grabbing Tyrell)
     ...and ours in here.

               JULIE
     Karla! You promised.

               KARLA
          (looking at Tyrell)
     I also promised Tyrell.

               TYRELL
     Promised me what, baby?
          (joking around)
     I made all my promises to William.

Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away.

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     Sweetie, you brought your nightie,
     didn't you?

               WILL
     Forward! A girl needs time to make up
     his mind.
          (to Julie, thoughtful)
     Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep
     on the couch and they can have their
     own room to practice for that real
     honeymoon.

But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES.

               WILL
     I'll take those.

               ESTES
     No, I've been doing this since before
     you were a dream in your father's eye.

Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are
left staring at each other.

               WILL
     You sure it's okay with you?

               JULIE
          (noting his sweetness)
     Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't
     snore.

               WILL
     You can toss a shoe at me if it gets
     out of hand.

She laughs and they go into the room.

                                   CUT TO:

25     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. Ray is hooked up to a heart monitor. Although he's
asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up.

WE RACK to a DOCTOR checking on him through the glass.

25A     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

We see a COP next to the doctor.

               COP
     He's beaten up pretty bad --

               DOCTOR
     Yes, but he seemed certain his friend
     was killed out on the highway by
     somebody named Ben Willis.
          (hisitant)
     He said he has a hook on his hand. He
     said he was driving a BMW.

As the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous
this must sound.

25B     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE UP: Ray's eyes pop open. He's listening.

26     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The cop explains things to the doctor.

               COP
     There's no body. And there was no
     other vehical involved.
          (beat)
     He fell asleep at the wheel...and ran
     his old truck into a guardrail. He got
     thrown way the hell down into a ditch.
     He's damn lucky.

They walk back down the ICU.

               DOCTOR
          (nodding)
     He suffered a severe head trauma --

               COP
     Probably once he rests up, it'll all
     come back to him.

The doctor and cop approach the nurse's station. The NURSE is reading
a magazine. She folds it away.

Suddenly, the monitoring equpment goes OFF with a series of LOUD
WARNINGS.

               NURSE
          (already moving)
     That's your number twelve --

The doctor, nurse, and country cop hurry back toward Ray's room.

               NURSE (cont'd)
          (yelling)
     Get me some help down here. We got a
     flatline, room twelve.

THEIR POV - THROUGHT THE DOOR

The wires and monitors are unhooked and Ray is GONE.

                                   CUT TO:

27     INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

A resort bar on the beach. Ocean breezes and surf SOUNDS come through
the window.

It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging
from decorative nets from the ceiling. There's a KARAOKE STAGE in the
corner.

Will and Tyrell enter and head straight to the bar. A bored bar
tender, NANCY, looks just like Jennifer Esposito, doesn't look up from
her paperback.

               NANCY
     You guys lost?

               TYRELL
          (re: the emptiness)
     Tell me this ain't the bar scene.

               NANCY
     Wanna drink?

               WILL
     We didn't get all dressed up for
     nothing.

               TYRELL
     Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or
     how about a Mai-Tai?

               NANCY
     How about some ID?

They freeze.

               NANCY (cont'd)
     Kidding.

They nod.

               WILL
     The guy at the desk said the place would
     be quiet, not dead.

               NANCY
     Didn't anyone tell you this is --

               TYRELL
     The last day of the season. Yeah, we
     heard.

               WILL
     So why are you still here?

               NANCY
     That's none of your business.

Tyrell sizes her up quickly.

               TYRELL
     What's the matter, boy trouble?

               NANCY
     Not anymore.

               TYRELL
     He leave you?

               NANCY
     No. I shot him.

Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.

               NANCY (cont'd)
     What you want is a Dark and Stormy:
     Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch
     of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck
     in the hurricane season, trust me.

ACROSS THE BAR

Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another.

               JULIE
     Am I bad? I mean, he's really great,
     and he's cute --

               KARLA
     He's cute...And he's got a crush on
     you...
          (off Julie's look)
     But...

               JULIE
          (appologetic)
     I miss Ray...I tried to call him.

Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm.

               KARLA
     Ray made up his own mind...so, you're
     free to make up yours.

Joining the men, but continuing her thought --

               KARLA (cont'd)
     For the next foury-eight hours...
          (joking)
     Your smile is a frown...turned upside
     down.

She illustrates with her own big smile.

               TYRELL
     Pretty cool bar.

               KARLA
     They all start to look the same once
     you've worked in one.
          (to Nancy)
     Am I right, sister?

Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their
fingers.

               JULIE
          (to Nancy)
     I'm Julie. This is Karla.

               NANCY
     Nancy.
          (sarcastic)
     Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin'
     hotspot.

Nancy continues making their cocktails.

JULIE

backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD
WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER.

She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her.

Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.

               NANCY
     Four Dark and Stormies...

They all pick up their drinks.

               KARLA
          (toasting)
     To a great weekend --

               WILL
     Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the
     weather!

               KARLA & JULIE
     I'll drink to that!

They drink and toast again.

               KARLA
          (to Nancy)
     So what do you do around here for fun?

Nancy looks straight at Will --

               NANCY
     Make fun of tourists mainly.
          (beat)
     Or let them make fun of themselves...

She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage.

               KARLA
     Karaoke -- perfect.

               JULIE
     Don't even think about it.

               KARLA
     Okay, I won't.

She's already heading for the stage.

               TYRELL
     Go baby! Go!

AT THE STAGE

CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of
songs.

               KARLA
     Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is
     for somebody who really needs it.
          (finds one)
     Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!

               NANCY
          (it's true)
     Everyone thinks their a singer.

               JULIE
     No way.

               KARLA
     Yes.

               JULIE
     No.

               KARLA
     Yes.

               JULIE
     Not me...no way...

               WILL
     Come on, it'll be fun.

               KARLA
     Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
     hands together for my friend, my very
     best friend, Julie James.

But there will be no mercy.

               KARLA, TYRELL, & WILL
          (chanting in unison)
     Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!

Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something
particularily awful.

               JULIE
     You asked for it.
          (to Tyrell)
     Song number thirty-nine.

Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy
strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then
melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT --
Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE."

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (singing)
     First I was afraid...I was petrified...
          (continues singing under)

Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her
LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning
out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (singing)
     I will survive...I will survive...

ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR

The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But
then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\
LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN.

               JULIE (cont'd)
          (singing --
          then trailing off)
     And I still know...what you did...
     last summer...

Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.

MICROPHONE

falls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone
stops dancing, confused.

CLOSE - JULIE

trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage.

               WILL
     Julie? What's wrong?

               JULIE
     It's...him.

               WILL
     What do you mean, Julie?

               JULIE
     He did something to the screen...it,
     it, said...

Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She
suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's
having a nervous breakdown.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...

Stung, she rushes off the stage.

               KARLA
     Julie...

But it's to late. She's bolted from the bar.

                                   CUT TO:

28     INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back
against it, trying to calm herself down.

               JULIE
     There's no way...just stop it right
     now...

She looks around the cozy room.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.

Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally
catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on
the bed. And that's when she sees it,

CLOSE - ENVELOPE

propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen
momentarily.

Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches
down and picks it up.

She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE
CARD.

ANGLE ON THE CARD

In bold print it reads: SURPRISE!

DARKFIGURE

appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins,
scaring --

WILL

who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The
bottle bursts and covers them with spray.

               JULIE
          (realizing)
     Oh, Will! I'm sorry.

               WILL
     It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I
     didn't think...

She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up
the mess.

               JULIE
     No, no, no. This was really sweet...

               WILL
     I scared you -- I crossed the line --

               JULIE
     No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a
     little on edge. I'm really sorry.

               WILL
     Hey, you don't have to appologize to me.
     I'm the one. I understand.
          (covering the awkwardness)
     I'm going to take a walk and dry off.

               JULIE
     Are you sure? I really appreciate it.

He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.

               WILL
     I just really like you and I want you to
     feel good about everything...You know? I
     want you to be happy.

He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He
reluctantly heads for the door.

                                   CUT TO:

28A     EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Will looks down at his wet pants.

               WILL
          (soto)
     Dork.

Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots
the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.

He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and
mopes down the hall.

                                   CUT TO:

29     INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the
windows.

               KARLA
     Tha's it.
          (bounce)
     I've decided.
          (bounce)
     I'm changing my major to finance.
          (bounce)
     And going to Wall Street.

               TYRELL
     Why?

               KARLA
     'Cause that's the only way I'm ever
     gonna be able to afford a big bed like
     this.

She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a
long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly
moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she
jumps up --

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Jacuzzi.

Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed.

               TYRELL
     Ah, baby, let's stay right here.

Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and
flirtatiously for Tyrell.

               KARLA
     I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if
     it's just so you can pull it off.

Tyrell gets off the bed --

               TYRELL
     I like the sound of this.

                                   CUT TO:

30     EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - NIGHT

Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow
rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.

Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a
big SPLASH.

The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.

               DERRICK
     Damn. I should've brought my pole.

He turns away. As he does, we see

THE END OF THE DOCK

where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by
moonlight.

Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other
tied-off staff and service boats.

He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish
sailboat.

He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an
EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps
and turns to see --

TITUS

standing there smoking a spliff.

               DERRICK
     Get lost, you scared me.

               TITUS
     Fish are all over the water...Come on,
     let us take a boat out.

               DERRICK
     Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up
     in Spain.

               TITUS
     That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.

Derrick throws the hose in its place.

               DERRICK
     There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats
     are going out.

               TITUS
     Storm is what makes it interesting.
     Thass why all the fish are up. Less
     hook us a couple big ones.

Derrick is now ignoring Titus.

               DERRICK
     I got work to do. Take the bake
     elsewhere.

               TITUS
     Up-tighteous and self-righteous.

Titus glides away into the dark. Derrick watches him go. There's
another SPLASH in the water near the dock.

Derrick walks to where the splash was. He kneels down by the edge --
watching BUBBLES RISE from the dark water below.

               DERRICK
          (to the fish)
     Hello, little sea bass. You're lucky
     I'm busy or I'd hook you myself.

WE PUSH IN AS HIS FACE GETS CLOSER TO THE WATER --

AND THEN -- RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DARK WATER DIRECTLY BEHIND THE
DOCKHAND -- A SINISTER SLICKER.

Derrick hears A SPLASH -- and just in time for...

SPLAT! THE OLD HOOK IN THE EYE. THE FISHERMAN PULLS HIM DOWN. HE
SCREAMS -- BEN YANKS ON THE HOOK -- AND DERRICK'S CRUMPLED BODY FALLS
INTO THE WATER.

ANGLE ON THE WATER

as poor Derrick's BLOOD MIXES WITH BUBBLES...

                                   CUT TO:

31     EXT. POOL/JACUZZI - NIGHT

Bubbles of a different kind. The JACUZZI sits in an enclosure at the
shallow end of the SWIMMING POOL.

And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the
churning tub. MUSIC plays on the boombox beside them.

The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander. Still clad in
her cute bikini, Karla pulls away --

               KARLA
     You sure you didn't pick up my hair
     tie?

               TYRELL
          (rubbing his bald head)
     Hello?

               KARLA
     Okay, I just didn't wanna get my
     hair wet.

               TYRELL
     Baby, I finally got you alone in this
     Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin'
     hair care.

She splashes him.

               KARLA
     Don't you get feisty...

Tyrell moves in for the kill. He won't take no for an answer.

               TYRELL
     Too late for that. We're miles from
     anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear
     you scream.

He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --

               KARLA
     I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to
     have to blow my whistle.

               TYRELL
          (playful)
     I'd hate for you to have to blow...your
     whistle.

Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment
becomes more passionate.

Karla opens her eyes in time to see --

TITUS

surface in the pool next to them.

Karla SCREAMS. And not just because it was a surprise. Titus looks
even uglier when he's wet.

Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking PHILLY BLUNT on the end of
his tounge.

               TITUS
     No water sports after midnight. Hotel
     policy.

Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi. Tyrell moves protectively in front of
her.

               TYRELL
     What's the policy on burnin' herb?

               TITUS
     We got one for that, too. It's don't
     try until you buy.
          (beat)
     You don't buy any, you don't get any.

Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into
his mouth, and swims off. Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back.

A dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm.
Tyrell sees him coming.

               TYRELL
     There's ten people on this whole island
     and they're all gonna end up in this
     Jacuzzi with us.

               WILL
          (getting in)
     How's the water?

               TYRELL
     Crowded.

               KARLA
     Ty!

Will slips into the water ignoring Tyrell's look.

               WILL
     Ahh, that feels great.

               KARLA
          (considerate)
     How's Julie?

               WILL
     Alone. In the room.
          (to Karla)
     Got any advise?

               TYRELL
          (annoyed)
     Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.

Karla shoots Tyrell a look.

               KARLA
          (to Will)
     Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta
     just get back up there and keep
     swingin'.

31A     EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ray is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment.

He looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain.

               RAY
     I need an international operator.

                                   CUT TO:

31B     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

In the empty night lobby, behind the desk

THE TELEPHONE

RINGS and RINGS. We push in on the phone RINGING unanswered in the
night. Nobody is around to answer it.

                                   CUT TO:

32     INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV
-- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE.

A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER
is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT.

INT. SHOWER

Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead,
trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP.

Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen,
listening.

               JULIE
          (calling out)
     Will...?

No reply.

AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY

In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody
there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.

AT THE SINK

Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns.
Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the
fogged-up bathroom mirror.

She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR,
MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE.

Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY
FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S
GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse.

ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR

as it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK.

INT. BATHROOM

Julie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door.
The sound STOPS.

INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM

She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.

               JULIE
     Will?

No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Is that you?

She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.

Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just
begining to rise again as...

KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing
at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes
immediately go to...

THE CLOSET

Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her
slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND
TUGS IT OPEN!

There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP.

She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to
it.

IT'S BLOOD.

She looks up.

THE DOCKHAND

comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. He's
dying before our eyes. Blood bubbling from his mouth. His body
twitching.

Julie stares at the body. She's almost catatonic. She blinks. She
blinks again.

Suddenly, in DEATH CONVULSIONS, his arms fly toward her --

She SCREAMS --

                                   CUT TO:

33     EXT. POOL - JACUZZI - NIGHT

Karla and Tyrell are drying off beside Will as their hysterical friend
comes racing across the pool plaza.

               JULIE
     It's happening again! There's a body!

Will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably.

               WILL
     What? What are you talking about?
     Where?

               JULIE
     It's in my room!

They can see she's not fooling around.

                                   BACK TO:

34     INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room. Julie is held
tight by Will. Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.

Brooks approaches the closet door. Julie holds her breath. He throws
it open. A long beat.

               BROOKS
     I don't find this at all funny.

Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. She can't believe her
eyes.

She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.

               JULIE
     There was a body! I swear it!

               WILL
          (delicately)
     Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe
     you were dreaming.

               JULIE
          (sharp)
     I wasn't dreaming.

               BROOKS
     I knew you people were goining to be
     trouble. I knew from the first time I
     laid eyes on you.

Julie grabs Brooks by his robe.

               JULIE
     Listen to me. He's here.

               BROOKS
     Who? Who is here?

She doesn't know where to start. Nancy pokes her head around the door.

               NANCY
     What's going on?

               TYRELL
     Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the
     closet.

               NANCY
     Cool.

               TYRELL
     The rest of us see bathrobes.

               JULIE
          (sharp)
     I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right
     there.

               TYRELL
          (not taking it seriously)
     Fine. Show me the body.

Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.

               KARLA
     Think about this, Julie. What did you
     actually see?

               JULIE
     The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck
     from up there.

               BROOKS
          (case closed)
     In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the
     "dockhand guy," and put the whole thing
     to rest.
          (looks to Nancy)
     Now, let's slow down on the Dark and
     Stormies and get some sleep.

               NANCY
     Don't look at me --

               JULIE
     I want off this island.

               BROOKS
          (tired)
     Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry
     left hours ago. And we got a storm
     coming. There won't be another one for
     days.

               TYRELL
     There's a storm coming?

               BROOKS
     'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a
     big one.

Julie goes for the phone.

               JULIE
     Then I'll call the mainland for a
     charter.

               BROOKS
     Phones went down a few minutes ago.

She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand.

               JULIE
     It's dead.

An exasperated Brooks heads for the door.

               BROOKS
     Duh. The next couple of days is gonna
     be rough, but we'll make it.

               KARLA
     What about a radio?

               BROOKS
     Sorry. Emergencies only.

               KARLA
     What the hell would you call this?

               BROOKS
     I'd call this four spoiled city kids who
     wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up
     their butts.
          (beat)
     All we can do now is batten down and ride
     it out. If things get really bad, there's
     a storm shelter.

And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a
CLAP of thunder.

JULIE

looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.

35     EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

And we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING
above her room to another

TINY WINDOW

in the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the
haggard face of Estes, the porter.

                                   CUT TO:

36     INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT

It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window,
shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck,
small fishhook dangling from it.

Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful
of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them
on a divination tray.

He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small
wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the
brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds
the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE.

ESTES picks up

A STRAW FIGURE

and impales it on his fishhook necklace.

His eyes roll back in his head. He enters a trance.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

37     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long,
dimly lit hall. She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room --
ROOM 228.

She stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks
them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door.

               OLGA
     Housekeeping.
          (beat)
     Housekeeping.

She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the
door. She looks at her other hand. Her arms and hands are covered in
blood.

She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of
them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --

The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and
slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM,
she is yanked into the room.

A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut.

We hear her SCREAMS from inside.

Establishing. Bars on the windows. Neon PAWN fickering. Hand-painted

39     INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

CLOSE ON AN ENGAGEMENT RING

Ray's engagement ring. The pawn shop owner, MAC, cowboy hat, knows his
job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye.

               MAC
     Jeez, that's a full carat --

               RAY
     How much?

               MAC
     Well, there's some flaws in her...

               RAY
     How much?

Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum
cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps...

               MAC
     Don't really have the market for
     something like this...
          (like it hurts him)
     I can go two...two-fifty.

               RAY
     Make it three hundred. And throw
     that in, too.

REVEAL - .38 REVOLVER

encased in a glass cabinet.

               MAC
     Hell, that's worth three, easy. And
     you got your waiting period.

               RAY
     I'm not waiting...So give me the gun
     and keep the ring.

Mac barely hasitates, he knows he's getting a steal --

               MAC
     Fine, buddy.

THE GUN AND THE RING

go down on the counter next to each other. Mac pulls out some forms.

               MAC (cont'd)
     Fill these out. Leave the dates blank.

Ray starts writing. Mac is overcome by a moment of humanity.

               MAC (cont'd)
     Buddy, are you sure this is the way
     you want to go?

Ray gives him a steely stare --

               RAY
     Is it loaded?

Mac shakes his head.

               RAY (cont'd)
     Load it.

Off Mac's sadness at young people today.

40     INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - DAY

We move into the hotel room and gradually reveal FOUR SETS OF FEET at
the end of one bed. They are crammed into a king-size bed together.

Julie is awake. She gets out of bed and moves toward the window.

It's raining outside. The wind is blowing. The storm has arrived.

Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. The hand belongs to Will.
She pinches the hand. Will starts.

Tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room.

               TYRELL
     This ain't the romantic weekend I
     had in mind.

Karla kisses Tyrell on the cheek.

               KARLA
          (to Julie)
     You get any sleep at all?

               JULIE
     Some.

Tyrell glares at Julie by the window. Sees the incredible rain.

               TYRELL
     Oh, look. Another day in paradise
     with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss
     Psychotic Episode.

               KARLA
     Hey --

               TYRELL
          (calling to Julie)
     See any dead bodies out there? Any
     fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?

Julie ignores him, staring out the window.

               WILL
     Leave her alone.

Angry at her boyfriend, Karla gets out of bed and joins Julie.

               TYRELL
     I'm just saying what all of you are
     thinking. It's bad enough gettin'
     rained out without having to hold
     her hand the whole time.

               WILL
     You don't have to be a jerk.

Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind
everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies.

               JULIE
     It's okay...He doesn't believe me.
     That's his right. I'm starting to
     think I'm crazy, too.

               KARLA
     Hey, slow down, turn off the little
     motor up in there...What do you say
     we go to the gym and work off a
     little stress?

Julie doesn't look to enthusiastic.

                                   CUT TO:

41     INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

Karla and Julie enter the gym. It has Nautilus machines, treadmills,
Life-cycles, free weights, tanning beds, speed and heavy bags.

Karla walks over and does a full roundhouse -- spinning and planting
her foot dead center of the heavy bag.

               JULIE
     Nice move.

               KARLA
     I'll be givin' your fisherman some of
     that and see how he likes it.

Julie smiles at her friend bravado. She steps over to a stairmaster
and starts her workout.

                                   CUT TO:

42     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

Will and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor.
They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby. The whole place seems
deserted.

               TYRELL
     Where is everybody?

               WILL
          (gallows humor)
     They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.
          (ghostly)
     Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll,
     joinnnn usss.

Will's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little
nervous, but hiding it.

               TYRELL
     Shut up.

They walk down the steps to the lobby.

43     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

They cross the lobby.

               WILL
          (calling out)
     Hello?
          (worried)
     There's nobody here, Tyrell.

Tyrell's already out the front entrance.

44     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Will and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps
outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. Debris from the
storm is scattered all around them.

               TYRELL
     They're around...They just don't
     care about us 'cause we're the
     contest winners.
          (beat)
     Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his
     lazy butt hook us up with fishing
     poles or Ping-Pong paddles or
     something.

               WILL
          (nervous)
     You know, the greenhouse effect has
     caused the gulf stream to shift and
     almost every meteorological expert
     expects a dramatic increase in
     tropical depression --

               TYRELL
     Hey -- shut up, okay?

Tyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept
vista. Not much of a day for activities.

               WILL
          (sotto)
     I don't like to fish.

Tyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his
tracks, looking up at --

IN THE WINDOW OF THE BELL TOWER --

ESTES, staring down at them.

               TYRELL
          (calling to Will)
     You coming?

Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes
is gone.

45     INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

Julie has finished on the stairmaster. Both she and Karla are sweaty
after a good workout. Their moods have improved.

               KARLA
     Come on, Vampira. I got just the
     thing for you.

Karla leads Julie over to the tanning beds.

               JULIE
     Cancer in a box.

               KARLA
     No, this is the safe sun.
          (joking)
     It's better than a day at the beach.

Julie is reluctant.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Come on, a little photosynthesis and
     you'll feel like a new --

               JULIE
     Houseplant.

Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed.

               KARLA
     Exactly.

Julie peels off her sweats. Lies down in her underwear. Straps on a
small pair of GOGGLES.

Karla lowers the canopy over Julie.

ANGLE ON A WALL TIMER

Karla sets the DIAL.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Set to three seventy-five, bake for

               KARLA
     Just kidding.

ULTRA-VIOLET TUBES

46     EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY

Tyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis
court,

TITUS'S POOL SUPPLY CART

half-obscured by the heavy fooliage surrounding the court.

Tyrell walks away from Will toward the cart. He hears the jam-box on
the cart playing "TRENCHTOWN ROCK" by Bob Marley..."One good thing
about music...when it hits you feel no pain..."

46A     EXT. HOTEL TENNIS COURT - DAY

The open door of the entrance CLANGS against the fence in the wind.
Tyrell decides to cut through the court to the far entrance and the
cart.

46B     INT. HOTEL TENNIS COURT - DAY

Tyrell walks across the court to the sagging net.

There is a RUSTLING in the foliage around the court. SOMETHING moving
fast and quietly.

               TYRELL
          (calling out)
     Hey, Bong Marley. Come here.

The door SLAMS shut behind him.

Tyrell looks back at the door. The latch seems to have stuck and it's
no longer swinging.

Tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees

The PIT BULL

standing in the doorway. Tyrell stares at the dog. The dog GROWLS at
Tyrell, low and menacing.

               TYRELL
     I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy.

Simultaneously, Tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward.

Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's LOCKED by a length of metal slipped
into the coupling.

He turns to see the dog bounding at him --

Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog
catches his pant leg. Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles
up.

The dog relentlessly barks and snaps as Tyrell climbs the fence.

WILL

looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link. He looks up at
Tyrell.

               WILL
     Come on. Jump. I've got you.

He reaches out to try and catch Tyrell.

ON THE FENCE

Tyrell finally looses his grip and falls back, landing on top of Will.
He rolls quickly to his feet.

               TYRELL
     Thanks.
          (furious)
     I gotta find me a pool boy.

47     INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

Karla hammers the bag with a series of quick punches. She finally
stops to catch her breath and hears a THUMPING from the other room.

48     INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

Karla sticks her head out the door to the gym, listening. At the end
of the hall

AN OPEN DOOR

is visible, a single BARE BULB lighting the room. Karla moves
curiously toward it.

49     INT. BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

Karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the THUMPING
NOISE SOUNDS LOUNDLY. She reacts --

A THUMPING DRYER

in a small laundry room. Karla relaxes.

               KARLA
          (doing Julie)
     Gee, Karla...That'll break the
     machine...

She approaches the MACHINE, which is rocking with the noise.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Damn. How many pairs you got in
     there?

She opens the dryer door and jumps back.

A BLOODY SHOE

flies out and into her arms. She looks down a beat, and SCREAMS bloody
murder.

A hot spray of blood gushes from the machine.

REVEAL - OLGA'S DISMEMBERED BODY

tumbling inside the dryer. Karla SCREAMS again. Then she hears the
SOUND of heavy boots coming down the hall. She runs to the door and
locks it.

She's trapped in a bloody basement cell. Suddenly somebody POUNDS on
the door. Karla SCREAMS.

She runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of
BASEMENT WINDOWS.

The door is hit again and again. Somebody is throwing their shoulder
against it.

Karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on
the panes.

                                   CUT TO:

50     INT. TANNING ROOM - DAY

Julie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES. She thumbs off her
WALKMAN.

               JULIE
     You say something?

Nothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS
echo down the hall.

Julie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is
JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie
is locked on the grill.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't
     funny.

Suddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free
herself.

JULIE'S POV - THROUGH THE PURPLE LIGHT

She sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer.
Julie could almost reach out and touch him.

She begins to SCREAM!

51     EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

Tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will
follows. Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles. He picks one up and
smashes it in half on the ground. He holds out the jagged bottle to
Will.

               TYRELL
     Take this.

               WILL
     And do what with it?

Tyrell breaks another bottle in half.

               TYRELL
     Julienne of pool boy.

They move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE.

52     EXT. POOL HOUSE - DAY

Tyrell and Will stop outside the door. There's MUSIC from inside. More
Bob Marley -- "Lively Up Yourself..."

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready.

Tyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him.

53     INT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY

They spill into the room. A light fog hangs in the air. The two of
them begin to COUGH and CHOKE.

Titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through
which gray light pierces the gloom.

Titus doesn't move. He's too still. In front of him is a large BONG
that still SMOKES SLIGHTLY.

               TYRELL
     Hey, pool boy.

Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back.

Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in.

His hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes
against the wall.

HIS FINGERNAILS SCRATHCED GROOVES

into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air.

Will points out two empty one-gallon PLASTIC BOTTLES.

ANGLE ON THE BOTTLES

One is labeled CHLORINE, the other MURIATIC ACID.

Will pulls Tyrell from the pool house.

54     EXT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY

The two of them collapse, COUGHING and CHOKING.

               TYRELL
     What the -- ?

Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face --

               WILL
     That's chlorine and muriatic acid.
     Put the two together and you get
     cyanide.

Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a
lung.

               TYRELL
     Cyanide? Like poison gas?
          (reality dawning)
     You mean, somebody really killed
     him...Omigod. Think...Think...

Suddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main
building.

                                   CUT TO:

55     EXT. BASEMENT WINDOW - DAY

Tyrell and Will follow Karla's CRIES to a narrow srip of basement
window which runs along the side of the hotel. Her palms have bloodied
one of the windows.

               TYRELL
     Get back --

56     INT. HOTEL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

Karla ducks down on the table just as the window EXPLODES inward.
Tyrell kicks in the pane and looks in.

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     Give me your hand!

She reaches for him. He pulls her up and out through the window.

57     EXT. BASEMENT WINDOW - DAY

Karla tumbles to the ground with only one thing to say.

               KARLA

58     INT. TANNING ROOM - DAY

Tyrell and Will suddenly burst through the door.

ANGLE ON THE TANNING BED

Where Julie is just visible, her fingers madly groping for a way out.

               JULIE
     Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.

Will struggles to open the bed, but the chain holds strong.

Tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell.

               TYRELL
     Hang on...

ANGLE ON THE CHAIN

Tyrell slams the barbell down, shattering the fiberglass handles.

A few of the ultraviolet tubes POP as Will yanks up on the cover.

They help Julie up, her eyes adjusting to non-purple light.

               JULIE
          (almost relieved)
     I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's
     here...
          (already moving
          for the door)
     We've got to get to the radio and
     call for help.

               KARLA
     I think we can classify this as an
     emergency situation.

They head for the manager's office.

59     INT. HOTEL - BROOKS'S OFFICE - DAY

They burst into the middle of the room before seeing that Brooks's
head has a machete sticking out of it.

               TYRELL
     Yo, Brooks, listen up --
          (reacting)
     Whoa --

Tyrell, Will, and Karla look at the radio, which is smashed on the
floor next to Brooks.

Julie stares in shock at the reverse wall, at

A STUFFED MARLIN

with the words "I STILL KNOW" written on it in blood.

Karla SCREAMS --

               TYRELL
     Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting
     psycho.

               KARLA
     We gotta get out of here. Now.

THE POWER CUTS OUT and the hotel plunges into darkness.

Julie SCREAMS and runs from the hotel.

               WILL
     Julie!

60     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Julie runs down the steps and cuts through the blowing palms.

                                   CUT TO:

61     EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - DAY

Julie is at the end of the dock. Tears are streaming down her face,
her chest heaving.

The others catch up with her. Karla realizes the boats are gone.
Everyone is freaking out.

               KARLA
     There were boats here? Refresh my
     memory, there were boats...

Tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line --

               TYRELL
     They were cut loose.

               WILL
     Julie? Wanna tell us what is
     going on here?

They look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared.

               JULIE
          (freaking out)
     We're all going to die. He's going
     to kill us one by one.

               TYRELL
     Who?

               JULIE
     Ben Willis.

               KARLA
          (not this again)
     Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed
     him. Now, get over it. We gotta
     think here.

               JULIE
     They never found the body.

Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     Two summers ago. We lied to the
     authorities. We hit Ben Willis with
     our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen
     ...We threw the body in the water to
     cover it up --

               KARLA
     Julie...

               JULIE
     Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry
     and Helen last July Fourth.

Tyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of
driftwood from the dock.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     I thought Ray and I killed him on the
     boat, but we didn't and now he's back
     to finish up the job.

Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid --

               TYRELL
     We're on an island, miles from
     anywhere. I don't give a crap about
     you're fisherman. There's dead bodies
     pilling up everywhere and there's one
     guy missing --

Will moves closer to Tyrell --

               WILL
     The porter...what's his name? Old
     Asbestos --

               TYRELL
     Estes! That's exactly who it is. That
     old guy knows something. We can sit
     here and wait for him to pick us off
     or we can go find him first.

Tyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes
a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who
hasn't moved.

               KARLA
     Julie, we have to do something.

Julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. She
reluctantly starts for Karla --

               JULIE
          (sotto)
     It's not him.

62     INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

Standard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks
on holiday.

Ray sits in a seat. He's in pain and does not look good.

He pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an
Orange Crush --

A dignified OLD LADY has been watching him --

               OLD LADY
     People live healthy in Miami.
          (sincere, but unsettling)
     It's the future down there every day
     of the week...The future.

Ray slumps back, waiting for the pills to work.

               RAY
     I'll keep that in mind.

63     INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - DUSK

The door to Estes's room BANGS inward. Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie
charge into the room.

               TYRELL
     Yo, Freak Boy --

The cluttered room is empty.

               WILL
     He's not here.

Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions.

               TYRELL
     We're gonna find some weird crap
     in here.

In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the
curtain back and discovers

A SMALL, HEAVY CABINET

sitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an
evil pall over the room.

Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors.

Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it.
Hanging before the altar is

THE LITTLE STRAW MAN

impaled on a fishhook.

               JULIE
     Voodoo.

               TYRELL
     I told you.

Julie looks closer. She sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted
other knickknacks belonging to her friends.

               TYRELL
          (to Karla)
     Missing a hair tie?

Karla looks in. Tyrell snatches the straw man up.

               TYRELL
     We found our guy.

THUNDER rumbles across the sky like the judgement of God.

                                   CUT TO:

64     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Julie, Karla, Tyrell, and Will walk quickly down the corridor. They
have grabbed some of their things.

               TYRELL
     We gotta find flashlights, torches,
     guns if they got 'em, anything
     that'll help.

Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.

               TYRELL
     Wait. Maybe he's down there
     collecting the body parts.

Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an "are you man enough?" kind of
glance.

               WILL
     Let's go.

65     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

The men head into the kitchen and bar area.

               WILL
     We'll only be a second, okay?

               TYRELL
     Yeah, wait right here, it's the
     safest place.

Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches
Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.

               KARLA
     Julie, where are you going?

Julie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
next to sailfish and marlin.

Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.

Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. It stops spinning. She
looks down at it.

CLOSE ON - THE GLOBE

and Julie's hand finding Brazil. We see the capital is not Rio, but
Brazilia. This is dawning on Julie when we hear --

               ESTES (v.o.)
     Brasilia.

She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the
shadows.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     That's the capital of Brazil, not
     Rio.

Karla SCREAMS.

Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes,
tackling him to the floor. Will is right behind him.

               WILL/ESTES/TYRELL
     Let go. I got him. That's me. It's
     him. We got you...

               JULIE
     Leave him alone.

Tyrell holds up battered Estes --

               TYRELL
     Here's youre killer --

               ESTES
     No --

               WILL
     We found your voodoo crap --

               ESTES
     No --

They shake Estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     I found the bodies this morning...I
     tried to use the radio, but he
     already destroyed it.

               JULIE
     Let him go. I believe him.

               KARLA
     Come on, Julie. You saw his room.

               ESTES
     I haven't hurt anyone...I stole
     those things to help you. To
     protect you.

               JULIE
     He's telling the truth. He could've
     easily killed me. He didn't.
          (beat while
          this sinks in)
     Look, we didn't even answer the
     radio question right...This whole
     thing was a setup.

               KARLA
     What do you mean?

               JULIE
     Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It
     was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.

               TYRELL
          (starting to lose it)
     You've got all these theories but
     where is he? Where? Where's your
     fisherman killer?

               JULIE
     I don't know.

               TYRELL
          (losing it)
     You never do...The guy at the
     nightclub, the body in your room last
     night. Little notes that only mean
     something to you. How do we even know
     you're not the one behind this --

Estes steps forward --

               JULIE
          (to Tyrell)
     How do we know you're not?

               ESTES
          (to Julie)
     I know who you're talking about. He
     used to work here at the hotel.
          (beat)
     And I've seen him around again. Out
     in the woods by the orchard.

They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?

               ESTES
     I can't remeber his name, but I
     don't forget a face.
          (beseeching)
     I can show you...

They stare a beat --

               WILL
     How do we know you're not setting
     us up?

               ESTES
     Where else you gonna go, son?

They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding
them.

               KARLA
     I know I don't want to stay in
     here.

               JULIE
     We'll be better off in the open. If
     we stick together, maybe we can kill
     this creep for good.

               TYRELL
     Show us.

They begin moving for the door.

                                   CUT TO:

66     EXT. FERRY DOCKS - NIGHT

Establish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are
securely battened down in the weather.

Ray limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock.
Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter.

                                   CUT TO:

67     INT. PAULSEN'S BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT

A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five.
There is a loud KNOCKING at the door.

               PAULSEN
     What the...

Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands
silhouetted against the rain.

               RAY
     I need to get to Tower Bay Island.

Paulsen senses something isn't right.

               PAULSEN
     We're closed.

Ray pushes his way in --

               RAY
     I need to get there, now.

Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.

               PAULSEN
     Did you happen to notice what's
     going on outside?

Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen --

               RAY
     I'm not looking for a weather
     report, I'm looking for a boat. So
     which one's yours?

                                   CUT TO:

68     EXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT

Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the
heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes.

It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if
you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what
Estes is doing.

               ESTES
     He worked here for many years. He
     had a nice family. A pretty wife
     and two little ones. A boy and a
     girl. They'd be about your age, now.

They continue along the path.

Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     One day his wife went missing. Maid
     found blood all over the honeymoon
     suite -- Room 201.

There are strange NOISES out in the woods.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     Eventually, they found her body.
     Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm
     washed up on Three Mile Beach.
          (beat)
     And the head they found much later.

A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the
underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     Careful --

               JULIE
          (softly)
     Did he do it?

               ESTES
     People say she was running around on
     him. People say he caught her in bed
     with other men. People say a lot of
     things.
          (beat)
     He disappeared, taking the two small
     ones with him. At least they were
     never found.

The winding path leads to a small orchard. They hang on his every
word.

               ESTES (cont'd)
     We're here.

In the center of the orchard is a cemetery.

They move off the path into the safety of the woods. There seems to be
activity around the place. It's silent and eerie.

Julie stares, fascinated. She is slowly drawn toward the house. Karla
grabs for her arm.

               KARLA
     Be careful, Julie.

               JULIE
     I've got to see.

She leads, they follow, circling the house. Julie rounds a corner of
the shack and stops. She sees --

TWO TOMBSTONES

The first stone reads: SARAH WILLIS (birth/death)

The second stone reads: SUSIE WILLIS (birth/death)

Beyond them

A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE

and the group moves slowly toward it. The headstone, partially
obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view.

The third headstone reads:

               JULIE JAMES
          born September 6, 1979
          died July 4, 1998
               "A Lying Whore"

"A Lying Whore" is scratched with a knife.

               KARLA
          (realizing)
     ...Today's July fourth.

Will goes to comfort Julie --

               JULIE
     I'm not dying on this island,
     Will.
          (louder)
     Do you hear me?

Julie shouts into the darkness.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     You want me, Ben Willis? Come and
     get me. I'm right here.

She kicks over her headstone --

               JULIE (cont'd)
     My grave stays empty!

She looks defiantly down the path.

               KARLA
     Julie, the boats are gone, the
     phones are down. There's no way off
     this place.

               JULIE
     Then, we fight --

Will looks around. Estes is gone.

               WILL
     Where'd Estes go?

               TYRELL
     What is up with that weirdo?

               WILL
     I'll go find him.

               KARLA
     Why? He can't help us.

               WILL
     He's probably the only one who
     can help us.

               TYRELL
     I'll come with you.

               KARLA
     Are you crazy? We're not staying
     here on our own.

               WILL
     It's okay. He couldn't have gone
     far. I'll catch up with you later.

Will disappears into the darkness.

               KARLA
     Maybe we should just wait here?
     Hide in a tree?

               TYRELL
     I'm not hiding up no tree.
          (to Julie)
     I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves
     to the teeth and kick this psycho's
     butt.

                                   CUT TO:

69     INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

They move cautiously into the kitchen. Blue emergency lights flicker
above them. It's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for
somebody to be hiding in.

Tyrell picks up a couple of different knives. He hefts them in his
hand.

               TYRELL
     What I need is a gun. Not a steak
     knife.

Karla grabs a paring knife --

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     You gonna clean vegetables? You
     gonna stir-fry? You need something
     that'll get his attention.

He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. He then
roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.

Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind. Julie catches the look.

               KARLA
          (hurt)
     I'm your best friend...You could
     have told me the truth about what
     happened. I would've understood.

               JULIE
          (sad)
     Karla, I just wanted the whole thing
     to be over. I didn't want to involve
     anybody else.

               KARLA
     It's too late for that.

Julie steps over to Karla.

               JULIE
     I'm so sorry. I brought this on
     everyone. It's my fault.

Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's
sympathetic.

               TYRELL
     Forget that. You didn't do nothing.
     This fisherman's a piece of scum.
          (hard for him to admit)
     I should've been listening to you...
     I'm sorry.

Julie smiles for a second.

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     Now, let's take a look at the
     pantry.

               KARLA
     You think that's a good place to
     hide?

               TYRELL
     I don't know, but I'm starving.

                                   CUT TO:

70     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house. He sees
Estes by the ocean, near a boat.

               WILL
     Hey Estes.
          (beat)
     Estes? Where'd you go?

Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will.

               WILL (cont'd)
     You abandoning us? How come you
     didn't tell us you had a boat?

Estes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly.

               ESTES
     This has to end. Now.

               WILL
     What -- ?

Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

71     INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door.

72     INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Tyrell steps inside.

               TYRELL
     Steel door...Food...Perfect.

He starts looking for something to eat --

CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone
freezes, staring into the darkness.

Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle,
listening. There's nothing but SILENCE.

He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty.

JULIE AND KARLA

move down an aisle behind him.

Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to
pounce. This aisle is empty.

JULIE AND KARLA

nervously move another aisle down.

Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges
forward into the row...Empty, also.

There's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell
turns and smiles at Karla and Julie --

               TYRELL
     It's just a --

A ROLLING PIN

bashes him on the back of the head. Tyrell hits the floor,
unconscious.

JULIE AND KARLA SCREAM

               KARLA
     Ty!

A DARK FIGURE jumps down from the shelves. Tyrell puts his arms up --

               TYRELL
          (yelling for mercy)
     Don't kill me --

               JULIE
     Wait, it's Nancy --

Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling
pin.

                                   CUT TO:

73     INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tyrell stands at the sink, where Karla holds a towel full of ice to
his head. Nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically.

               NANCY
     I'm sorry, but you could've been
     the one doing all of this --

               TYRELL
     And so could you -- crazy fool.

               NANCY
     You stumbled into my hiding place.

               TYRELL
     Must have missed the sign.

               NANCY
     Excuse me, but this island didn't
     have a murder rate until you people
     showed up.
          (chilled)
     I've never seen a dead body before.

               JULIE
     Get used to it.

               NANCY
     Who's doing this?

               TYRELL
          (friendly)
     Don't even get her started...It's a
     long, long story and you probably
     wouldn't believe a word of it.

Tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. He crosses past the
stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.

               TYRELL (cont'd)
     I mean, all I know for sure is this
     is the worst vacation of my life...
     I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I
     personally haven't seen one damn
     psycho killer...

THWACK! A STEEL HOOK

sinks deep into the base of Tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject
surprise on his face.

The women freeze as Tyrell dances like a marionette before being
hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan.

THE FISHERMAN

is in the vent above the stove. He stares out at them from the hood of
his slicker.

Ben jumps from the range onto the floor. Karla is in shock. Julie
yanks her and they flee.

As she goes, Julie picks up

A LOOSE KNIFE

and hides it in her back pocket.

74     EXT. OFFSHORE ON FERRY - NIGHT

Ray pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water. He's navigating by
compass, maps spread before him. He sees something off the bow --

A BOAT

drifting on the fast sea. The words "Tower Bay" are painted on the
side. Ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty.

He reaches for the radio.

               RAY
          (into radio)
     Come in...This is Summer Breeze
     requesting emergency assistance for
     Tower Bay island. I repeat...This
     is Summer Breeze...

Ray guns the boat away.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

75     INT. HOTEL FOYER - NIGHT

Julie, Karla, and Nancy run into the lobby. The storm is WAILING
outside the front doors.

They pause for a second. Behind them we hear the rapid THUD-THUD-THUD
of Ben's boots.

Nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight. She points
to the main staircase.

               NANCY
     I know where we can hide.

76     INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

The women run up the stairs. Behind them, we hear Ben's FOOTFALLS
echoing.

77     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

On the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway.

At the far end of the hall, Nancy illuminates a section of the
ceiling.

               NANCY
     Give me a boost up --

Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.

A WOODEN LADDER

pulls down. Nancy quickly climbs up.

BEN WILLIS

enters the hallway and continues toward them.

ON THE LADDER

Karla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor. They both scramble
upwards --

Ben hits the ladder --

Just as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS --

BEN'S HOOK IS ON HER FOOT!

Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits
him in the chest and knocks him back.

Julie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them
like a drawbridge.

78     INT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT

Julie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. They
fumble with it --

               JULIE
     There's no way to lock it.

               KARLA
     What do we do?

From below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it
open. The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip.

There's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then,
the rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut.

               NANCY
     There's no way to grip this thing.

Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It
wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down.

They try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away.

The attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden
beams and pink insulation.

               NANCY
     Watch your step...

THUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.

79     INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

KARLA'S FOOT

dangles through the ceiling.

                                   SMASH BACK TO:

80     INT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT

Julie helps Karla back up onto a beam.

               NANCY (cont'd)
     Stay on the beams!

Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress.

Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to
beam. His hook glints in the light.

Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn.
They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an
opening to get back to the hatch.

Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --

He misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she
sees a

WINDOW INTO THE HONEYMOON SUITE

She sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily
transfixed. Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben.

               BEN
          (re: the mirror)
     You'd be amazed by what you'd see.
     My wife with every man on the
     island, for example.
          (to Julie)
     And you, sexy...I loved watching you.

               JULIE
     You sick freak.

Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both
lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before
falling --

They CRASH through the mirror --

81     INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass.

Karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his
hook.

82     EXT. ROOM BALCONY - NIGHT

Karla backs onto the porch. She backs up against the railing.

                                   CUT TO:

83     EXT. ATTIC WINDOW - NIGHT

Julie and Nancy reach the CATHEDRAL WINDOW. They open it and look out.

84     EXT. ROOM BALCONY - JULIE'S POV - NIGHT

and Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing.

Karla looks behind her, sees

THE GLASS ROOF OF THE ORCHID HOUSE

which doesn't look nealy strong enough to suppor her.

Ben advances, swining the hook. Karla leaps over the railing and onto
the glass.

85     EXT. GREENHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

Karla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass.
The GLASS begins CRACKING, subtle crack lines splintering out from her
footsteps.

Ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook.

Karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto
her back on the glass.

She lifts her head. Starts to move...CRACK. The glass is fracuring
beneath her. She looks through the glass.

KARLA'S POV - THE ORCHIDS BELOW

She tries to slide toward a support...The glass CREAKS and MOANS as
she moves across the room.

               KARLA
          (to herself)
     Oh, god, no --

She's almost to the support when

THE ROOF EXPLODES

taking Karla down into the orchid house.

86     INT. ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

The roof shatters in an explosion of flying glass.

Karla land on her back.

She's unconsious --

                                   CUT TO:

87     INT. ATTIC WINDOW - NIGHT

Julie and Nancy look at the empty space which once was a roof
supporting Karla --

               JULIE
          (screaming)
     Karla!

Ben turns and looks up at Nancy and Julie. Then, he sprints from the
balcony.

Julie and Nancy duck back into the attic.

                                   CUT TO:

88     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Julie and Nancy climb down into the hallway. They are cautious,
expecting Ben at every turn.

89     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

They hurry across the lobby.

                                   CUT TO:

90     INT. ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

A sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and
shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids.

Karla lies unconscious. Slowly, she opens her eyes.

There's a rustling in the flowers. She tries to get up, but can't yet.
She waits in terror as

BIRDS

fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.

Karla tries to stand and her leg gives way. She tests her knee --

               KARLA
     Oww...

Karla starts hobbling. She reaches the door -- it's locked from the
other side.

There is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door.

The cranes startle again, something upsetting them. Karla spins to
look. Nothing.

                                   CUT TO:

91     INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

Julie and Nancy arrive at the door. Karla pounds on the other side --
points to the lock.

               KARLA
     It's locked!

Nancy sees a KEY RING by the door.

               NANCY
     It's gotta be one of these.

Nancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She
moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide --

ORCHID HOUSE - JULIE'S POV

A powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of
bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR
KARLA.

               JULIE
          (terrified)
     He's inside.

Karla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes,
now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY.

               KARLA
     Please! Hurry!

92     INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

Nancy fumbles with the keys. Drops them. Julie tries to keep calm.

               JULIE
     Come on...

93     INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

Ben closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes. He skewers a
bud on the tip of his hook.

Karla pounds on the door.

               KARLA
          (frantic)
     Hurry!

Nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old.

               JULIE
     Nancy...

               NANCY
          (crying)
     It's jammed!

The key is stuck.

               KARLA
          (through glass)
     Come on!!

She's running out of time. Julie sees a FIRE AXE encased in the glass
safety box.

               JULIE
          (determined)
     No way!!

Julie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe.

               JULIE
          (to Nancy)
     Move!

Julie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks.

Ben is almost on top of Karla now.

Julie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie
drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through.

Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her
through.

Julie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She
stares him down.

               JULIE
     Come on, gimme a shot --

Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie.

               KARLA
          (shouting)
     Julie, come on.

They flee. Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him. He
can't fit through the circular window. He throws his shoulder against
the door. And again. And again.

The door frame starts to give --

                                   CUT TO:

94     EXT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

Julie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground
storm cellar. Julie carries the axe.

               NANCY
     It's over there.

They struggle together to open the heavy door.

95     INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

Stairs lead down into darkness. Karla hesitates --

               KARLA
     I don't know...

               JULIE
     Come on, you can make it.

Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed
behind them.

               NANCY
     There's a light somewhere.

96     INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

The darkness is complete. We hear MOVEMENT.

               KARLA
     Julie?

               JULIE
     I'm right here. Grab my hand.

               NANCY
     This place has emergency power.
     Just ease you way down the stairs
     and I'll find the light.

               JULIE
     Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla,
     just get my hand.

               KARLA
     I'm holding your hand!

               JULIE
     No, you're not.

               KARLA
     ...Nancy?

Nancy pulls the chain on an overhead bulb. The lights go on,
illuminating

THE DEAD CORPSES

of Brooks, Derrick, Olga, and Titus -- whose hand Karla is holding.
The women SCREAM!

They muddle together, trying to collect themselves.

Suddenly, there is a POUNDING on the iron door. They SCREAM.

Then, Julie remembers the axe. She motions the others to stay back --

               JULIE
     All right --

The iron hatch is slowly opening. Julie gets the axe into possition --

WILL

pokes his head through. He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon.

               WILL
     It's you guys, thank god. Is
     everyone okay?

They are ecstatic to see him. They bound up the concrete stairs --

               KARLA
     Help's here. Help's here.

97     EXT. HOTEL WALKWAY - NIGHT

Will is already on the move toward the hotel.

               WILL
     Come on. We're gonna be okay.

               JULIE
     Did you get help?

Will shakes his head. He's walking woozily.

               JULIE (cont'd)
     What happened?

               WILL
     Estes came after me with a gaffing
     hook.

               JULIE
     He's in it with Willis?

               WILL
     I guess so.

Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too.

               JULIE
     Your stomach, you're hurt --

Will looks down, clutches himself, and keeps moving.

               WILL
     When I was coming back I saw your
     slicker friend looking for you guys
     down by the water.
          (beat)
     Let's hurry and get inside...

                                   CUT TO:

98     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Ray guns the boat straight up onto the beach. He leaps from the boat.

                                   CUT TO:

99     INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Will slumps down on the bar floor. He's floating in and out of
consciousness. Julie leans over him, concerned.

               JULIE
     Oh, my god, you're bleeding to
     death.

She looks back towards Nancy --

               JULIE (cont'd)
     We need a first-aid kit.

               NANCY
          (already moving)
     I saw one in the lobby.

Karla starts, then hesitates. Will moans, looks at her.

               NANCY (cont'd)
     I'll come with you.

               WILL
     You'll be okay. It's over.

Karla and Nancy rush from the bar. Julie looks tenderly at Will. He
looks back at her. She pulls some hair off his forehead. He smiles
weakly.

               JULIE
     Will, just hold on. We'll get you
     fixed up.

                                   CUT TO:

100     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Karla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk.

               NANCY
     Look up there. I'll look over here.

Karla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves.

                                   CUT TO:

101     INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Julie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach. She's fussing
with the clothes, looking for the wound.

               JULIE
     You've got blood everywhere, but I
     can't find the wound.

Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye.

               WILL
     That's because it's not my blood.

The slow change in Julie as she realizes...

She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her.

               WILL (cont'd)
     It's time you woke up, Julie.

His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey.

               WILL (cont'd)
          (as Mark in the Morning)
     AND START CONTEMPLATING THE ULTIMATE
     MAGIC GETAWAY!

He drags her out of the bar.

                                   CUT TO:

102     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. She reaches for it...
It's a first aid kit.

ANOTHER HAND

reaches over and lands on top of her hand. She jumps and sees Estes
right behind her. Karla SCREAMS.

               ESTES
     Will...He's in on it. He's --

Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and

A SPEAR TIP

appears in the front of his chest.

Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see

BEN WILLIS

standing there holding a spear gun.

Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying,
convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.

               NANCY
     Help me.

Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.

The fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at
Karla's head.

THE HOOK CATCHES

on a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy.

               KARLA
     Come on, come on.

Ben tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts
his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight,
driving

THE SPEAR TIP

deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     Damn you.

Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a
boot and sends Karla fying onto

A GLASS TABLE

in the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished.

The fisherman works his hook free from the post. Karla is unmoving and
looks quite dead.

                                   CUT TO:

103     EXT. WOOD TRAIL - NIGHT

Will pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain. He's got her by the
hair. She's slipping and falling.

               WILL
     Look at the bright side, Jules. We
     finally get to spend some quality
     time together.

Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.

               JULIE
     Why are you doing this to me?

               WILL
     Me, me, me. It's always about you.
     I'm having bad dreams. I can't
     sleep. I'm not doing well in school.
     I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.

               JULIE
     I trusted you.

               WILL
     We had a connection, didn't we? I
     can tell you one thing, though. Ray
     didn't trust me. He was right. He's
     dead, but he was right.

They come into the orchard. They are covered in mud. Julie stumbles
again. Goes to her knees. Works the knife free and slashes up at Will.
She slices him across the face.

He steps back, feels the blood.

               WILL (cont'd)
     What'd you have to do that for?

There is a creepy pause. Will stares at his own blood. She catches her
breath...

Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand. He lifts her by
the hair. Enraged, he puches her in the face. She goes down.

                                   CUT TO:

104     EXT. ORCHARD - NIGHT

Will has Julie in a choke hold. He drags her toward the open graves.
Julie is losing energy, slowly giving up.

               JULIE
     ...Why?

               WILL
     Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll
     get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.

He shoves her. She falls backward into the arms of Ben Willis.

               WILL (cont'd)
     Hi, Dad.

Julie WAILS, struggling wildly in Ben's grasp.

               JULIE
     OMIGOD --

               BEN
     That's my boy.

Ben holds her back to look at her. He throws back the hood of his
slicker. We see his face clearly for the first time.

               JULIE
     No, no, no --

Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.

               BEN
     Shush, now. No more screaming...No
     more running. Time to die.

               RAY (v.o.)
     Let go of her! Now!

Ben and Will spin to see

RAY

like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.

Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him.

               WILL
     You gotta be kiddin' me.

               BEN
     What're you gonna do, boy? Call
     us names?

               RAY
     Let her go. Now.

Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.

Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on
and gets the point to Julie's neck.

               BEN
     Think about it, boy. You're no
     killer.
          (beat)
     That's my job.

Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.

Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of
him. Will moves closer, too.

               RAY
     Stop right there.

Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.

               BEN
     You don't have it in you.

Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the
shoulder. The gun goes flying.

Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own
grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.

Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.

Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the
eye.

               WILL
     We haven't missed you down here,
     Ray boy. I got to know Julie real
     well.

Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking
him. Ray is begging to check out.

               WILL (cont'd)
     Think of all the things I'm gonna
     do to her.
          (beat)
     Dad, finish him.

Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse
slashing --

At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.

THE HOOK

goes straight into Will's chest.

The fisherman has hooked his own son.

Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.

Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud.

Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired.

THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him
with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving
up...

Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his
eye.

               BEN
     Gonna blind you first.

The hook is touching the eyelid --

A GUNSHOT

rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away
from Ray.

JULIE

stands behind him holding the gun.

               JULIE
     Just...Die.

BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward
into Julie's grave.

As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...

A MUDDY LANDSLIDE

slowly covers Ben up.

Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt --

               BEN
     You can't kill me.

His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.

               BEN (cont'd)
     I'll always be with you.

The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the

GLEAMING METAL HOOK

waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling.

Julie goes to Ray.

                                   CUT TO:

105     EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving
past some shrubbery when

A DARK FIGURE

jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back.

KARLA

stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.

               KARLA
     Oh, god, it's you --

               JULIE
     You're okay. Thank god.

               KARLA
     Is he?

They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose
themselves.

               KARLA (cont'd)
     You know, it's true what they say
     about package vacations...You get
     what you pay for.
          (beat)
     Now, how about we get off this piece
     of crap island.

The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie
as the beautific light catches her face.

Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a
beautiful orange sunrise.

               JULIE
          (smiling)
     We don't have to tell anyone it
     rained the whole time. It can just
     be our little secret.

The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and
they start walking for the beach as...

A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER

rises into view.

                                   MATCH CUT TO:

106     EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Establish. The sun setting over a quaint street in a college town.

SUPERTITLE:               FOUR MONTHS LATER

Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her
shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.

She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She
rolls the bike right up to the front door.

                                   CUT TO:

107     INT. HOUSE - DAY

Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another
bike in the hallway.

It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's
another NOISE...from inside her house.

She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the
shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.

NOTHING

She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --

The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.

It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.

               JULIE
     Ray...what are you doing?

               RAY
          (toaster)
     Oh...it's not working right.
     You're home early.
          (sees she's shaken)
     Did I scare you?

               JULIE
     Never do that again.

               RAY
          (tender)
     Hey -- I didn't know you were here.
     It's okay.
          (beat)
     We got the refrigerator in. Come
     see.

She sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him.

               JULIE
     I love it here.

               RAY
     It's gonna be great.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:

107A     INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Julie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom.
She pauses in the doorway --

107B     INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic
devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a
low WHIRRING sound.

               RAY
          (seeing her)
     Checking the locks again?

               JULIE
     You know me to well.

Julie smile and walks to the bedroom.

                                   CUT TO:

107C     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Julie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly.
The windows are closed. The closet door is shut.

The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a
highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear
sits in a chair.

There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She
hears it again. She climbs out of bed.

                                   CUT TO:

107D     INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes
from the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.

Julie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice
the dirty imprint of a boot below the window.

107E     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.

Behind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious,
happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.

107F     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a
crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it
wasn't.

Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror
next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't
see anything. She throws open the closet door.

NOTHING

She looks around the room.

               JULIE
     What is my problem?

She sits down on the bed.

We see her bare feet from under the bed.

She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.
Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to
the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --

A HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --

THE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED

Julie turns too late --

The fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes
down --

Her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the
bed.

CUT TO BLACK:
THE END
