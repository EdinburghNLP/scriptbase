          FADE IN:

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M.
          Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
          sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
          line up for a public function.

          2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2


          SUPERIMPOSURE:

          BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
          Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
          and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          (in Elvish, subtitled)
          I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.

          SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
          And remember Wink-

          (BEAT)
          Don't be shy.
          He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,
          up, up, like a bat. Five floors up...

          Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite
          and has been dated circa 700 B.C.
          Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
          TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
          can have a closer look.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          We'll open the bidding at two hundred
          thousand dollars.
          A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we
          have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van
          Hausen - Three hundred thousand once-

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
          thank you Mrs. Bernstein-
          As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and
          heads down -

          4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4

          -a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.
          Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
          clinging to the smooth granite wall!!

          STEWARD
          What the h-
          Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
          mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has

          VANISHED!!!
          The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels,
          hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.
          Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence.

          A silent human- almost as good as a dead
          one...

          (BEAT)
          Almost.
          He releases the STEWARD, who falls-

          -DOWN-

          -DOWN-
          -down- TKKCT!!!
          Flailing in utter silence. All the way. Onto the fence.

          AUCTIONEER
          And now, for our next item. Lot #777.
          Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in
          maroon velvet is an eight-inch, ornately decorated arc of
          gold.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
          first time in auction. A piece of the
          Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
          artifact dating from the Atrebatean
          period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
          gold.
          The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
          audience.

          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
          Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
          may I have your attention. As I was
          saying, observe the fanciful creatures
          adorning the outer surface, figures from
          a lost mythology...
          The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
          Shadowy Figure speaks up.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
          perhaps, but very much alive.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 4
          A few emergency lights come on, revealing The Shadowy
          Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer.

          AUCTIONEER
          Sir, would you please identify yourself?
          I see no badge or-

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          Shall we just say that I am the rightful
          owner of this piece?
          He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer grabs a phone and
          hits a button.

          AUCTIONEER
          (to a Steward)
          Security- Call Security-
          This is an outrage- An-
          The SHADOWY FIGURE reaches into his pockets and throws a
          handful of seeds at the Auctioneer's feet.

          AUCTIONEER
          -Outrage of-
          KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout into massive, thick branches and
          roots and instantly engulfing the Auctioneer amidst coils of
          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
          disbelief.
          WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
          Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
          fast and hungry!!
          At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
          and the people's SCREAMS redouble.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          May this remind you all why you once
          feared the dark...
          A multitude of eyes glint in the darkness, rows and rows of
          tiny teeth shine greedily. They lunge at CAMERA.

          7 INT. BROOM'S LIBRARY - NIGHT 7

          A Christmas tree glows next to the fireplace; Mozart is
          playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:

          TOP SECRET.

          MANNING
          Hey, Fishstick- We gotta talk.

          $ INT. FREAK CORRIDOR - NIGHT 8

          As they walk down the hall, manning shows Abe.

          MANNING
          Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
          straight at the camera lens.

          ABE
          Oh, Lord- He's smiling in this one.

          MANNING
          I know- It's not just the money. It's the
          provocation. This is asking for trouble.
          His ego-
          Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike.

          MANNING
          "Man-ning..."
          He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.

          MANNING (CONT'D)
          -is out of control. And I think it's all
          deliberate on his part.

          (BEAT)
          He hates me.
          Layers of steel doors trundle open in sequence.

          ABE
          No, he doesn't. He's just- enthusiastic.
          As they approach HB's room...

          MANNING (CONT'D)
          How are things between him and Liz?

          ABE
          Oh, you know. The usual. Since they moved
          in together- Good days and bad.
          On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
          swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
          hinges.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Then again, there are the really bad days-
          Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
          dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
          smoking and in flames.

          HELLBOY
          Oh, hi Blue- Manning-
          He puts out a small flame on his forearm and steps into the
          room.

          Abe and Manning peek inside-

          9 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 9

          HB stumbles around the rubble, wreathed in smoke. He holds a
          bunch of blackened LPs and 8-track cassettes.

          HELLBOY
          (yelling at Liz)
          Look- I have one rule! One- "Don't touch
          my stuff -"
          Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame.
          HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin.

          LIZ
          You have the same album on CD, LP and an
          8 track- An 8 track!!!

           HELLBOY
           You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!!
           You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the
           way to go- one day mankind will realize
           its mistake.

          LIZ
          What about me? I need some space! Not
          much, but just enough to find- to find-
          my- toothbrush.
          She flares up, losing control...

          HELLBOY
          Is that what this is about?? Your
          toothbrush's right there, behind you-
          (Liz turns)
          There- there- with the cat food!!
          Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from
          a heap of spilled cat kibble.

          LIZ
          Damn it, Red- there's no room for me
          here. You can't just act like-
          Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated.

          Surrounded by racks of weapons, Abe, Hellboy and Liz suit
          up.
          Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a
          leather jacket. She jams an automatic handgun into her
          utility belt.
          They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a
          fleet of planes, cars, boats, helicopters and tanks.
          They load weapons and ammo on board their usual
          transport/mobile quarters - a GARBAGE TRUCK.
          The perfect gentleman, Hellboy holds the door open for Liz.
          The truck interior has been refurbished with more high-tech
          equipment.

          MANNING
          Oh, Jeez- did you see the crowds?
          He offers HB a couple of cigars and lights one for him.

          MANNING
          This is midtown Manhattan... Will you
          promise to be careful? You'll use
          discretion?

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)

          (GLARING)
          I can be discreet if I want to be-
          They exit the truck and enter the building. Manning sighs.

          use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the
          devastation.

          Two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway. Hellboy

          HB trains his flashlight on a fallen display case. Broken
          glass glitters.

          You can't mean that-

          Abe, Liz and Agent Mudd fan out, moving cautiously toward
          the auctioneer's overturned podium.
          Abe discovers an empty cage... and on the iron door, the
          embossed ROYAL SEAL. Abe hears a high-pitched chitter-
          chatter and looks around: Nothing.

          ABE
          Red- I'm afraid I do detect some activity-
          As the agent and Liz inspect the other iron cages, he
          extends his webbed fingers.

          Manning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference.

          MANNING
          The situation is completely under
          control. Earlier tonight, customs agents
          discovered a few illegally imported
          items. This caused a minor confrontation.
          The reporters go wild with questions.

          Plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall. Hellboy
          shoots, blowing open a massive hole.
          He peeks inside-
          Small bodies burrow away like moles.

          HELLBOY
          What are they-? Abe?

          21 INT. INTERCUT - SALES ROOM/CORRIDOR - SAME 21

          Abe finds a human femur, wet and gnawed.

          ABE
          Ah, I knew it.

          (BEAT )
          They're vicious and cruel and-
          The floor ripples with activity.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Have you noticed the floor??

          HELLBOY
          (looking around)
          Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown-

          ABE
          Red- there is no rug-
          Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an
          inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo.

          HELLBOY
          Aw, crap-

          ABE
          Precisely...

          (BEAT)
          These things have a very active
          metabolism. They, um- excrete as soon as
          they eat and then need to eat some more.
          There are no corpses 'cause there are no

          ABE
          Alright, but-

          LIZ
          Damn it Abe, just tell us!

          ABE
          Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies.

          LIZ
          Abe, c'mon- cut the crap.
          She checks her boots, sticky with poo-

          ABE
          Third century, the Teutoburg forest.
          Famished. They feed on calcium-

          (BEAT)
          And they do go for the teeth first. How
          do you think they got that name "Tooth
          Fairies"??
          Liz senses movement in the darkness. She holds out her hand
          and starts a small fire on her palm.
          She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness-

          NOTHING-

          23 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 23

          Agent MARBLE comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out
          from a crack in the wall. It's about 9 inches high, with
          olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half-
          light. It whimpers softly.

          AGENT MARBLE
          Hey, this guy is cute -i.
          He reaches out to touch it.

          AGENT MARBLE
          Are you scared, buddy?
          Across the room Hellboy sees the Agent nearing the Fairy.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 14

          HELLBOY
          No, don't-
          The thing SNARLS, leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into
          MARBLE's finger. Then it dives under MARBLE's shirt and goes
          to work.
          MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
          from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.
          Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig
          in.. ribs crack... blood spurts. The agent falls.

          24 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME 24

          Liz lights up both hands, illuminating a surging tidal wave
          of hungry critters that engulfs the room, gnawing at the
          wallpaper, the furniture!
          The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like
          wriggling piranhas.

          ABE
          (backing away)
          Oh, my-

          25 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 25

          Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things
          swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears...
          Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering
          dozens of creatures onto the walls.
          Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring
          from the walls. HB claws at dozens more, which cling to him
          like baby monkeys.

          26 INT. SALES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 26

          The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the
          iron cages. For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe.

          HELLBOY
          (sudden panic)

          LIZ!!
          In reply, he hears a faint scream. He bats at the things
          with the SHOTGUN, wading further into the room.

          He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars
          of a cage...
          .Liz cowering inside. Hellboy just has time to look deep
          into her eyes. A quick moment of silent communion.

          HELLBOY
          Do it, Liz, do it!!!
          And Liz obeys. Closing her eyes she-

          LIZ

          The fire's not my enemy. It is part of me-
          -gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame.

          ABE

          UH-OH-
          He takes refuge as-

          LIZ
          It is mine-
          -the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire. Liz goes
          supernova. BAMMM!!!

          27 EXT. AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 27

          A ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony. The crowd
          and reporters look up, amazed.

          Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing
          others with the butt of his shotgun. As flames leap up, the
          things regroup and renew their attack.
          Liz and Abe run for the stairs.

          LIZ
          Red, Red, this way-
          Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again.

          HELLBOY
          No- I'll deal with them- NOW.
          He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of VULCAN 66
          grenades. Holds it high.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Vulcan 66, boys! Come and get 'em-
          Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs. They see Hellboy
          luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the
          street.

          10
          As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all
          grenades. Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and

          29 TNT / EXT - AUCTION HOUSE 29
          Like a cannonball, HB flies out the upper floor window.
          A ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting,
          writhing fairies.
          Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands
          in their midst, cracking the pavement.

          Liz and Abe go to the window and look down. A TV CAMERA LENS

          ZOOMS IN ON THEM BOTH.

          HB?? HB?? Are you alright??

          31 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 31

          The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
          climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
          People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
          jumps at a woman but-
          BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
          efficiently shoots its fellows.
          Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
          it up by the tail, like a rodent.
          Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
          sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          (looks at Manning)
          Gee whiz, Manning-

          34 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT 34

          Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
          and TV.

          GUARD 1
          Check it out. That guy's make-up is so
          fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
          Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.

          GUARD 2
          And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.

           GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
           Hey, we got us a wino.
           He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.

          35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT

           Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
          Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.

          GUARD 2
          Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.

          36

          36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT

          Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!

          BAMMKM ! ! ! !
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
          remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
          WINK emerges from behind the shack.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 19
          Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.

          37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37

          A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
          follow me, Sire.

          38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38

          The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.

          PRINCE
          I will not.

          CHAMBERLAIN
          Then, I regret to say, you may not see
          your father. It is the protocol, sire.
          For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
          the last time- surrender your sword.
          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-

          PRINCE
          Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-
          WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
          huge, rusting iron door.

          39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39

          An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.

          PRINCE
          Father.
          (eyes the Princess)

          SISTER-
          The KING gestures for him to rise.

          KING
          Why have you done this??
          His voice trembles with anger.

          KING (CONT'D)
          Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.

          PRINCE
          I have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.

          KING
          No- You have broken a truce that has
          lasted for centuries.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 21

          PRINCE
          A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
          you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-

          (BEAT)
          And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.

          PRINCESS
          What they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-

          PRINCE
          Honor-?

          (BEAT)
          Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??

          (BEAT )
          Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
          scraps from their table??? Where is the
          honor in that??

          KING
          And what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?

          (PAUSE)
          It may just be that our days are ended...

          PRINCE
          It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.

          PRINCE
          .we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.

          KING
          No- you cannot be that mad-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 22

          PRINCE
          Yes. I am.

          KING
          This is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?

          PRINCE
          Yes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.

          KING
          Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.

          PRINCE

          (GRIM)
          I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.

          PRINCE
          Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises

          IT-

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          All of those in favor, make it known.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 23
          All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
          kneel.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          Good- I see the council is as brave as
          it's always been...

          (BEAT)
          And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.

           PRINCE (CONT'D)
           Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.

          40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
           Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.

          41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41

          The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-

          42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42

          The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
          wound in his left arm.

          PRINCE
          No- no- you fools-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 24

          43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43

           As another troll lifts his sword high-

           PRINCESS
           (calling out)
           Yrdrig!!
          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.

          44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44

          The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-

          45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45

          -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
          The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
          bleeding arm.

          CUT TO:

          46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46

          Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
          Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
          Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
          HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!

          HELLBOY ON TV
          Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
          fought many creatures over the years but
          none as strong as me-
          He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 25
          Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
          beer.

          HELLBOY
          I think I did good. And I looked good,
          don't you think, Liz?
          Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.

          ABE
          Look- there's Manning...
          He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
          microphones.

          MANNING ON TV
          Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
          somewhere in-

          HELLBOY
          A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
          The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
          overflowing with mail.

          MANNING

          PLEASE-
          Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.

          MANNING
          Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
          hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
          Only Liz-

          (BEAT)
          Only Liz handled herself with any
          dignity.

          LIZ
          (glancing at HB)
          No one asked me anything.
          Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
          table.

          MANNING
          Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
          trending five to one against us.

          HELLBOY
          Against?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 26

          LIZ
          (glances at some letters)
          Polls- protests- hate mail-
          Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.

          LIZ

          (READING)
          "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
          lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
          She glares at Hellboy.

          HELLBOY
          Ungodly freaks-? Us?

          MANNING
          You really did it this time- I'm under
          review.
          (to Hellboy)
          But so are you- As of today, there's a
          new team leader.

          HELLBOY
          New - ? What?

           MANNING
           Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
           We're to meet him at the conference room
          at 0900-
           (looks at his watch)
          Now.

          47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47

          The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
          one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
          pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
          HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.

          HELLBOY
          What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
          trust me anymore?

          MANNING
          Oh- I never did- But after last night,
          Washington wants a new public face for
          the BPRD-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 27

          HELLBOY
          What about me? What's wrong with my
          face???

          MANNING
          Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
          you've ruined it all-

          HELLBOY
          But, who-? Who is this guy?

          MANNING
          How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
          the big shot-
          (he reads a file)
          His name is Johann Kraus-

          HELLBOY
          Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a physical medium, head of the European
          branch of the BPRD-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          You know I have a problem with Germans-

          MANNING

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
          Practice from the University of Munich
          and a very eloquent speaker-

          HELLBOY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          -Germans make me nervous-

          MANNING
          I guess they need a nice open face- A
          face people can trust.
          Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
          suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
          latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
          head...

          MANNING
          . Oh, my God-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 28
          .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
          He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
          Fairy Cages.
          Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.

          JOHANN
          Johann Kraus, at your service.
          His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
          Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
          toward them.

          HELLBOY
          (whispers to manning)
          That's an open face for you...

          48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48

          Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
          and the others gather around him.

          JOHANN
          Poor things, bought and sold on the black
          market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
          Let's see what they can remember-

          HELLBOY
          Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
          (nudges Abe)
          -but maybe I can be of help-
          Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.

          JOHANN
          Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          What are you doing?

          JOHANN
          I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,

          MECHANICAL-

          HELLBOY

          INHABIT-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 29

          ABE

          TELEPLASTY-

          JOHANN
          Exactly.
          A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
          slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
          -"Dead" Fairy.

          JOHANN
          I can briefly take control of entities,
          both mechanical and organic and
          reactivate their neural system-
          The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
          more do the same from another pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (points at Hellboy)
          You scare him-
          The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.

          HELLBOY
          (leering at it)
          Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
          my tail- Yes, you-

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Rough translation: He says you are rude,
          brutish and not too bright-

          ABE
          Touche.
          More high-pitched jabbering...
          Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Enough. it seems our little friend here
          remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
          in the last place where his cage was
          traded: market sounds-

          (BEAT)
          Troll language-

          LIZ
          The troll market- ?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 30

          JOHANN
          Exactly, Miss Sherman.
          The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
          weak.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
          good.

          JOHANN
          I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
          He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
          to die-

          HELLBOY
          Wow- You have that effect on me too.
          The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
          Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
          fingertips.

          ABE
          How can we find the Troll market??? Its
          location has been a source of speculation
          for centuries

          JOHANN
          Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
          And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
          places it under Washington Bridge

          ABE
          We've looked there before-- Staked it out
          for weeks-

          JOHANN
          Yes, but this time I have asked for a
          very special piece of equipment-
          He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"

          ABE
          "336" The schufftein glasses??

          JOHANN
          (smiles knowingly)
          On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
          have this clue-
          He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 31

          JOHANN
          In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
          questions??
          Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
          his hand-

          JOHANN
          Yes- what is it?

          HELLBOY
          If you're really German- how come you
          don't have a funny accent?

          JOHANN

          (SIGHS)
          Get ready. We are on the move.

          49

          49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS

          Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.

          HELLBOY
          What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
          thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
          for that place for years and we've never
          found it-
          (looks at Abe)
          You said so-
          Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
          copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
          tries it on.

          LIZ
          Get used to it. He might be here for good-

          HELLBOY
          For good?!

          LIZ
          He has a nice voice.

          ABE
          Yes, very commanding, very soothing.

          HELLBOY
          I think he's a jerk.

          ABE
          I like him.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 32

          HELLBOY
          Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The
          brains of the operation-" give me a
          break!

          JOHANN
          They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
          are waiting there.

          LIZ
          I think you feel threatened...
           Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard.

           CUT TO:

          50 EXT. WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT 50

           The Garbage truck and a few other BPRD vehicles crossthe
          Washington Bridge on the way to CHINATOWN.

          SIGN: WASHINGTON BRIDGE 21.00 HOURS

          51 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 51

          Hellboy rides in silence- still thinking hard- then.

          HELLBOY
          Ha! Me? Threatened??
          Glaring, at Liz:

          HELLBOY
          By whom? By him??

          LIZ
          Not just him- this whole thing you did.
          The TV- the reporters-

          HELLBOY
          I did that?

          LIZ
          Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
          without thinking- You just wanted to be
          in the public's eye- well- you're there-
          but so are we.

          HELLBOY
          Hey- We got some hate mail.

          (SHRUGS)
          We'll deal with it. Together.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 33
          He comes closer to her.

          HELLBOY
          Something else bothering you-?
          Liz nods quietly.

          HELLBOY
          So- Tell me about it-

          LIZ
          I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-

          (BEAT)
          I don't like being watched. I never have.
          I feel like a freak only if someone's
          watching me.
          Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and
          fenders.
          The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV
          CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally,
          hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan,
          UK, Germany...

          CUT TO:

          52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52

          Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the
          press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders
          push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy.
          Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
          support/hatred signs.

          MANNING
          May I suggest that tonight you refrain
          from signing autographs.

          HELLBOY
          It's the garbage truck. It makes the
          wrong statement. About who we are.

          MANNING
          You think that's what this is about?
          Transportation???

          The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the
          soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge.
          At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs.
          Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage.

          You say you can read things- things about
          people- so read me- c'mon- read me-
          The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds.

          REPORTER 2 (CONT'D)
          What do you see?

          ABE
          Very well, if you insist.
          (webbed hand on reporter's chest)
          You... keep... a large, battery-operated
          vibrating egg by your bedside...
          A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.

          REPORTER
          You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?

          HELLBOY
          It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
          One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy
          gazes back at them- seething.

          JOHANN
          Let me take care of this.
          Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann
          Kraus and I beg you to allow us-
          (interrupted by catcalls)
          -Please, we need space to work- please-

          WE-
          The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for
          silence.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          In due time- very soon- we will provide
          all the answers you require, all the
          whos, whys and wherefors- But for now-
          An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-

          HELLBOY
          Great P.R...
          He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.

          LIZ
          Shh! Give him a chance...

          JOHANN
          -it's been a long... long time... for
          many decades really, that the BPRD has
          served you- all of you... in silence. We
          have waged an unknown war - but a very
          real one. Heroes have died unrewarded and
          unrecognized so that you might go about
          your daily life. To work, to marry, to
          bid your children goodnight.
          Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.

          JOHANN
          In exchange, we have been consigned to
          the lies and racist innuendo of the
          tabloids. And there we have lived without
          complaint - until now.

          54

          54 MONTAGE
          Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast TV VANS, HOMES,
          PUBS and BARS all over the world to a fascinated human
          population. All colors and creeds.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 36

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          But perhaps soon- after learning of our
          hardships and sacrifices, you may decide
          that our humble lives may, in some way,
          have a value... and a meaning-

          - DOCKS - NIGHT 55

          55 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE

          The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head.

          JOHANN
          I pray that you will allow us to defend
          your good fortune- to guarantee the
          blessing that is a peaceful night's
          sleep. A night free from monsters and
          nightmares. And if so-
          (chokes back tears)
          If so- then all we ask in return... from
          you... is a little respect and the
          chance, remote as it may be, to prove
          ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in
          this- God's Earth.

          HELLBOY
          (rolls his eyes)
          This is sooo corny-
          A moment of silence ensues--
          Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds-
          Liz applauds, Abe applauds. Hellboy is agog!!

          HELLBOY
          What-?? What-??

          ABE

          (DAZZLED)
          He has a nice voice.
          All business now, Johann steps over to the group.

          JOHANN
          Come on. We have work to do-

          56

          56 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling
          alley rooftop. The CROWDS are visible in the distance.
          Hellboy looks through THE SCHUFFTEN GLASSES.

          57 EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          The BPRD truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly
          under the bridge. Its back door is open; Liz and manning are
          at the communications center.

          LIZ
          I read you, Red. Keep looking-
          Manning is bored, looks at his watch.

          MANNING
          Looking at what, for goodness sake-?
          (looks at the Schufften glasses)
          What do these things do-?
          Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and
          prisms. Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear.

          ABE
          In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of
          Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical
          sets with the intent of photographing
          fairies in England...

          MANNING
          Let's get out of here- We're never going
          to find it-

          HELLBOY'S VOICE
          Hey- Sparky, I think we got one.
          Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing
          a shopping cart full of cats-

          MANNING
          That? Oh, please, she looks as sweet as
          she can-

          LIZ
          Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter...
          (to Manning)
          Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour"
          to seem human and nice-

          These lenses allow you to see their real

          As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady
          transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll.

          (PAUSE)
          What about the cats?

          LIZ
          She eats them.

          MANNING
          "She??" That's a "she"?????

          HELLBOY
          We're moving in, Sparky-

          61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61
          HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service

          DOOR-

          / SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62

          62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and
          through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of
          rolling balls and toppling pins.

          HELLBOY

          (WHISPERS)
          Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh?

          ABE
          (splays his webbed fingers)
          Bowling balls- they give me trouble.

          HELLBOY
          How about a beer, then? Now that we're
          "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 39

          JOHANN
          Sorry. I don't drink.

          HELLBOY

          SHEESH-

          63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63

          Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old
          woman. Just a Warehouse-

          JOHANN'
          Adjust the prisms to "2"
          Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own-
          unsuccessfully.
          Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical
          elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
          instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy
          rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree
          trunks and stone columns are visible...

          ABE

          THERE-
          Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical
          lock.

          HELLBOY
          What the heck is that?

          ABE
          A locking mechanism-

          HELLBOY
          Mmh- I'll take care of it-
          He clenches his stone fist, rears back...

          JOHANN
          No- You destroy it. We'll never get in-
          He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
          approaches the lock.

          HELLBOY
          Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch-

          JOHANN
          Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the-

          Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase.
          Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off
          the valves.

          JOHANN
          Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.

          66 INT. TROLL MARKET - NIGHT 66

          Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...
          .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
          curiosity aroused, he follows her.

          67

          67 MARKET STALL
          The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
          stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
          It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
          beauty is transcendent.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 41
          Abe is thunderstruck.
          As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
          bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
          arms!

          ABE
          (into microphone)
          Brother Red!!

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Not now, Abe.
          As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
          her.

          68

          68 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a
          surly SHOP OWNER.

          SHOP OWNER
          Never seen anything like it. No one sells
          `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
          Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
          gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
          feet encased in iron shoes.
          Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-

          HELLBOY
          Hiya, Chuck-

           - SAME 69

          69 EXT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES

          Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another
          one, narrow and dark. Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats
          them away.

          70

          70 EXT. SHOP - SAME

          Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop
          owner.

          JOHANN
          What about this?? Do you recognize this
          seal?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 42
          The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.

          SHOP OWNER
          You'd better go. Now.

          JOHANN
          Please. We'll make it worth your while.
          The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
          forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!

          SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
          He's not friendly-
          Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.

          HELLBOY
          Well, neither am I-
          BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
          toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
          until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
          dogfight.
          The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
          with blind instinct.
          Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
          close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
          boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
          everywhere.

          HELLBOY
          Feeling more chatty now??

          SHOP OWNER
          It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
          all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
          revolt against the human world-
          Hellboy releases him, then looks around.

          HELLBOY
          Where the hell is Abe??
          He pushes his belt locator-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 43
          1.,,,d 71 INT. TROLL MARKET ALLEY MAZE - NIGHT 71
          The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
          her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
          hands it to her.
          A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty-

          ABE
          I'm following a lead, Red. Keep your
          locator -.
          A large TROLL cuts him off-

          ABE
          Excuse me- What do you think you're
          doing?

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Are you in trouble? Talk to me, Abe.
          Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          I don't think you-
          The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
          looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my-
          The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
          into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
          on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
          groans.

          HELLBOY
          Abe? What's wrong?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 44
          Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot. But his vision
          blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the
          cobblestones.

          HELLBOY

          (INTERCOM)
          Abe? Come in - Abe? Dammit -

          72 EXT. SHOP - SAME 72

          The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
          look at each other.
          Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
          crowd.

          73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73

          Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
          surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
          door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
          It's not there.

          PRINCESS
          If you are looking for your weapons, my
          guards took them.
          Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
          away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
          fine silk robes.
          She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
          featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.

          ABE
          I - I carry no weapons, madam- I assure
          you...

          PRINCESS
          Why were you following me?
          Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
          beguiled by her.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Are you seeking to join my brother?

          ABE
          Your brother-??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 45

          PRINCESS
          In his revolt against the humans?

          ABE
          A revolt? No, no, no, I- You are sorely
          mistaken...
          He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
          barking and growling.

          PRINCESS
          Then answer me truthfully- Why were you
          following me?

          ABE
          My name is Abe Sapien -

          PRINCESS

          (LAUGHING)
          There is no such name!

          ABE
          Horrible- I know- but- Please, hear me, I
          beg you. I am an agent of the Bureau for
          Paranormal Research and Defense. If we
          can assist you-

          PRINCESS
          Give me your hand.
          Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
          palm.
          The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
          the YRDRIG to yield.

          PRINCESS
          Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
          The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
          three tongues.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
          The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.

          ABE

          (WHEEZING)
          Nice puppy...

          A
          The YRDRIG lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him
          playful shake.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 46

          PRINCESS
          My father gave him to me. Yrdrig, leave
          our guest alone-
          The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor.

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          Out! Out! Bad Yrdrig!
          As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up-

          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
          (bows her head)
          My name is Princess Nuala.

          ABE
          (bows his head)
          Your highness, the honor is all mine.

          PRINCESS
          May I apologize, Mr. Sapien, for the
          manner in which we brought you here...
          couldn't be too sure.
          She offers him the locator belt.

          ABE
          Please, it was nothing. Love the puppy,

          TOO-

          PRINCESS
          And under diplomatic immunity - may I
          seek asylum??

          ABE
          We would be... honored, I'm sure. But,
          may I ask: from whom do you seek asylum?
          Suddenly, a COMMOTION outside. The door flies off its
          hinges. Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile
          fallen guards outside.

          ABE
          Red, no! I'm all right!
          The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm.

          ABE
          Gentlemen! Some respect, please!
          The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards.
          The NARCOTIC BUGS buzz around HB, who swats them like
          mosquitoes.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 47

          PRINCESS
          And that was my royal guard.

          ABE
          Red, apologize at once! We are in the
          presence of... royalty!
          Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a
          schoolboy.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          You're vouching for her, I take it. Mr
          Sapien?

          ABE
          Oh, most definitely. She's from an
          ancient, noble line -

          JOHANN
          - of warriors. The Children of the Earth.
          (to the Princess)
          I'm sorry, Princess Nuala. With such a
          fierce bloodline, we cannot take your
          claim of allegiance at face value.
          He produces the ANCIENT SEAL.

          74 INT. MAPMAKERS VESTIBULE - LATER 74

          Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle
          and examines the ancient seal.

          PRINCESS
          Where did you get this?

          HELLBOY
          Human side, two nights ago-
          The Princess studies their faces.

          PRINCESS
          In ancient times a seal like this was
          delivered to the enemy as a declaration
          of war. A signal from the underground
          realm to the entire world. It prefaced
          the awakening of the Golden Army-
          Johann sits down heavily.

          JOHANN
          I feared as much.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 48

          HELLBOY
          (to Johann)
          What-? What-? A goblin army-?
          Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry.

          JOHANN
          Golden Army. The unstoppable tide. There
          has been nothing to substantiate such a

          TALE-

          PRINCESS
          Not a tale- At the dawn of time... Even
          before the great flood, man and the
          Children of the Earth shared this
          planet...
          (she sighs)
          But as man in his greed expanded his
          dominion, there ensued a bitter war...

          DISSOLVE:

          75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75

          Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
          upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
          hordes of men.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          In those days, my people were led by my
          Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
          Elfland.
          KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
          tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.

          PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
          The bloodshed went on year after year.
          Many lives were lost.
          An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
          the horizon.

          76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76

          Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
          wretched guild of deformed goblins.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 49

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          It was then that the King ordered the
          Sigri to build him a new, invincible
          army.

          77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77

          Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          This was an army that would not eat,
          drink or grow tired. A heartless,
          ruthless force made of the purest metal,
          mined from the depths of the earth.

          78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78

          In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
          up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
          command.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          The Sigri worked until the winter moon
          was high in the sky -
          The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
          of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
          directly over the King's head.

          KING
          I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
          Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
          my right???
          Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
          crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
          TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.

          79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79

          As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
          earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
          with the arms of the approaching troops.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 50

          80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80

          The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
          humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.

          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into
          exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
          the Earth ever needed him.
          Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

          81

          81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT

          The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under
          the light of ten thousand flickering torches.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 51

          PRINCESS (V.0.)
          And the golden army was ordered to lie
          dormant, locked inside the earth itself -
          and there it is to this day, waiting for
          the wearer of the crown to command it
          again.

          82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82

          The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at
          each other.

          HELLBOY
          Where is that crown??

          PRINCESS
          My father had it destroyed. Cut into
          three pieces. One for mankind...
          She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a
          chain around her neck.

          PRINCESS
          .Two for the sons of the Earth.

          ABE
          So, you do need our help..?

          PRINCESS
          I'm afraid it's the other way around.
          She holds the CYLINDER she purchased.

          PRINCESS
          The location of the Golden Army is
          contained within this cylinder--
          She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
          extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.

          ABE
          Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old
          name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here-

          PRINCESS
          But nothing else-
          She rolls back the map into the cylinder.

          PRINCESS
          So far, this is a family matter. To
          intervene will bring nothing but trouble.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 52

          HELLBOY
          Good, I like trouble.

          83 INT. TROLL MARKET NARROW PASSAGES - NIGHT 83

          The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
          crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
          the rear.

          PRINCESS
          No- not that way. Too risky-
          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-

          JOHANN
          (finally, pointing)
          There. Stairs to the street...

          BUT-

          PRINCE
          Hold!
          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:

          PRINCE
          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.

          PRINCE
          I'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.

          HELLBOY
          I'm gonna put this as delicately as I
          can.

          CUT TO:

          84

          84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME

          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...

          BOWLER
          Look out, Manny! Strike city..!
          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.

          85

          85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come
          is back. He
          running. As their lights blaze up, REPORTER 2
          gapes in disgust:
          Hellboy's massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a
          sweet little OLD LADY! He beats her mercilessly!

          OLD LADY
          Help me...! Please, somebody..!

          REPORTER 2
          (to his cameraman)
          Oh, my God!! Oh, my- Roll! Roll on this!

          BELLBOY
          It's not what you think -!

          REPORTER
          (pointing at HB)
          He's lost his mind! He's worse than any
          of them..!
          CUT BACK to Hellboy, revealing that the old lady is actually

          WINK.
          Liz runs over with a prism from the SCHUFFTEIN GOGGLES and
          sticks it in front of the camera lens, revealing the truth.
          The reporter checks his monitor.

          REPORTER

          OH-

          86 STREET FIGHT 86
          ALL the BPRD team, including Liz, is swept up in this fight.
          The denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and
          knock down lamp posts, ROARING with excitement.

          LIZ

          (MUTTERING)
          The fire is not my enemy-- it is a part
          of me--
          Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
          flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
          it away.
          As the other monsters retreat...
          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
          to the BPRD truck.
          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
          screaming, renewing the panic.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          I will find you, young daemon -
          (to Nuala)
          - and you, too, my sister. Meanwhile,
          here's a taste of what lies in store.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 55
          He throws the grenade. Hellboy dives, just in time to catch
          it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
          its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!

          HELLBOY
          It's a dud, your royal assness - !
          The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.

          HELLBOY
          How do you like that? Just when I was
          loosening up.
          Then... CLACKK!!!.
          Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
          beans.
          flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly colored

          ABE
          Pick them up!!

          HELLBOY
          Abe. relax- It's jumping beans...
          Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.

          ABE
          Do as I say!
          With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.

          ABE
          How many do you have?

          HELLBOY
          Three, how about you?

          ABE
          Three! There's always seven! Find the
          last one!!!

          TO
          The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
          edge...

          ABE
          Quick, it's going for water!
          Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
          into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God, evacuate the area!

          HELLBOY
          Abe, please, get a grip.
          A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
          the moonlit clouds.
          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. Just like the story books.
          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.

          LIZ
          This is so beautiful-

          MANNING
          So- perfect- so peaceful-

          HELLBOY
          Hey!!!
          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-

          HELLBOY
          Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-
          Jeez did you have to do that??
          Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-

          LIZ
          Back- Go back- right now!!!

          MANNING
          What? What? What is he doing-?

          LIZ
          He's knocking on wood- summoning an

          ELEMENTAL-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 57

          MANNING
          An elem-

          LIZ
          A forest spirit that lives in that tree.
          He's releasing it-

          MANNING
          Oh, and is it that bad??
          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
          descends.
          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant

          ELEMENTAL.
          Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.

          HELLBOY
          Good dog.
          (to Elemental)
          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
          you fight with me.
          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.

          ABE
          (to the Princess)
          This may not be the best place for you,
          your majesty. With your permission...
          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
          Johann sees this-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 58

          JOHANN
          I have a plan-
          He looks at Abe-

          87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87
          -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
          BPRD garbage truck.
          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.

          88 ABANDONED BUILDING

          88
          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.

          89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89

          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.

          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90

          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.

          HELLBOY
          (to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:

          ABE
          (on the radio)
          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 59

          HELLBOY
          So what?

          JOHANN
          So, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.

          HELLBOY
          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!

          ABE
          You'll figure it out.

          HELLBOY
          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.

          91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91

          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.

          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92

          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.

          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 60

          ABE
          Johann - they're almost here.
          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.

          ABE
          Yes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.

          ABE
          (gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??

          JOHANN
          If you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.

          JOHANN
          (to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.

          JOHANN
          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.
          (seeing Hellboy coming)
          Quickly, Abe!

          94 IN THE WATER 94
          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.

          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95
          Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
          barges.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 61

          96

          96 IN THE RIVER
          Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.

          JOHANN (CONT'D)
          (on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

          IT-

          ABE
          I need more!

          JOHANN
          No more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.

          97

          97 UNDERWATER
          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

          98

          98 AT THE BRIDGE
          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.

          PRINCE
          (to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 62
          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.

          PRINCE
          This might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.

          HELLBOY
          I've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable

          TENSES-

          JOHANN
          (to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.

          HELLBOY
          Nap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 63
          The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
          the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.

          CUT TO:

          99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99

          BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.

          JOHANN
          You'll permit a small criticism? You take
          too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
          Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
          for something.

          HELLBOY
          Oh, I wish for something.
          Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
          of shots, dead center.

          JOHANN
          Speed is of the essence. You must work on
          it. I'm willing to spend some -
          Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's
          onto the floor.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, watch it! You're winding me up, I
          don't like it.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 64

          JOHANN
          On the contrary.

          100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100

          Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where
          Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a
          terry cloth towel.

          HELLBOY
          You keep wiping that thing like she's
          gonna care.

          JOHANN
          She- Who-??

          HELLBOY
          You know who- She-

          (BEAT)
          She's not gonna care.

          JOHANN
          (long beat)
          You think I'm after Liz, don't you?
          (Hellboy walks out)
          Well, I'm not.

          HELLBOY
          Why not?

          (BEAT)
          Not good enough for you?
          Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind
          Johann.

          HELLBOY
          Well- From now on, you don't come near
          her. You don't talk to her-

          JOHANN
          You forget. I'm part of the team now,
          such interactions are inev-

          HELLBOY
          Well- you better start making them
          "evitable"-

          JOHANN
          That's not a word-

          HELLBOY
          Yes, it is-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 65

          JOHANN
          No, it isn't-
          Hellboy raises his stone fist.

          HELLBOY
          Now it is-

          JOHANN
          Oh, I see- you want to punch me- That's
          how you win an argument.

          HELLBOY
          I try.

          JOHANN
          Well, you're big, I'll give you that much-

          HELLBOY
          "Give me???"- You don't give me sh-

          JOHANN
          -and you're strong- but you're slow.

          HELLBOY
          Slo-??

          JOHANN
          Very- slow- I've seen your fighting
          style. Very slow-
          WHAM-! Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive
          fist. To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium
          shatters!

          HELLBOY
          Slow enough for ya-??
          With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!

          HELLBOY
          Ow- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got
          carried away...
          (leaning over the empty suit)
          Johann? You still hear me?
          An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and
          penetrates the closest locker.

          HELLBOY
          It was an accident, okay? I'll get you
          some help-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 66
          With a CLANG! -- the bank of lockers comes to life! Metal
          doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball
          machine! his face imprinted in the metal.

          JOHANN
          See? Speed is the key.
          The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
          and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
          goes by.
          Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits.

          HELLBOY
          Chicken shit!

          CUT TO:

          - NIGHT 101

          101 INT. THE LIBRARY

          Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at
          one of the book stands, reading to him.

          PRINCESS
          "I sometimes have a queer feeling -
          especially when you are near me, as
          now: it is as if I had a string somewhere
          under my left ribs, tightly and
          inextricably knotted to a similar string
          situated in the corresponding quarter of
          your little frame."

          ABE
          I love this part. Keep going.

          PRINCESS
          "I am afraid that cord of communion will
          be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion
          I should take to bleeding inwardly."
          She closes the book, looking troubled.

          ABE
          Charlotte Bronte died shortly before I
          was born. It would have been a great
          privilege to have known her...

          PRINCESS
          This "Jane Eyre"... I understand it's
          only a story, but such a tie that binds,
          it exists between me and my brother. I
          assure you: my brother, he's not dead-

          ABE
          How can you know? We all saw-

          PRINCESS
          We are twins. Even now, I can sense his
          presence. This has been our way since we
          were young children, in Renvyle-

          ABE
          Renvyle, Ireland- The ancient isles-

          PRINCESS

          (NODS)
          A magical place in the West. A different
          time. Long gone. Now, he's near and he's
          looking for me. I can feel and even
          understand his. hatred for mankind.

          ABE
          Men... usually mean well, I believe that.
          But they need our help and patience.

          PRINCESS
          You were very brave, vouching for me. How
          do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing
          me here?

          ABE
          It's as you were saying, I suppose. From
          intuition, feeling. I've never met anyone
          like you... but that's my instinct.
          They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles
          swirl out of Abe's gills.

          102 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background
          the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV
          programming.

          HELLBOY
          He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him
          next time.
          He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc.

          LIZ
          There shouldn't be a "next time" we're
          all part of the same team.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 68

          HELLBOY
          We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac.
          You can see right through him.

          (PAUSE)
          That's a joke, Liz.
          Liz remains silent.

          HELLBOY
          (raises a letter)
          Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series,
          based on me? And this:
          (he holds up a box of cereal)
          Product endorsement - breakfast of
          demons. And a videogame!!!
          As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume
          up.

          LIZ
          Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It
          always gets me- Red- There's something I
          need to-

          HELLBOY
          (taking the remote)
          No, wait.
          (switching to Leno)
          Look that's us-
          Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident.

          LENO
          So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
          really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
          has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,
          Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a
          good sign.

          HELLBOY

          (CHUCKLES)
          Ha- He's funny.

          LENO
          Maybe we should have him come over and
          talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink??
          The crowd roars.

          HELLBOY
          That's a great idea, don't you think??

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 69

          LIZ
          No, I don't-

          HELLBOY
          Did you know that during the commercial
          breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the
          guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the
          conversation fresh.

          LIZ
          How do you know these things?

          HELLBOY
          I read it in TV Guide.

          LIZ
          You're really liking this, aren't you?

          HELLBOY
          We should do this-

          LIZ
          It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really
          need everybody to like you?? What's in it
          for you?? Are we not enough???
          She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted
          in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball
          balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles.

          HELLBOY
          That's funny.

          CUT TO:

          103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103

          Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann
          approaches her.

          JOHANN
          Are you alright-?
          Liz nods weakly.

          JOHANN
          May I be of assistance??

          LIZ
          Maybe.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 70

          JOHANN
          He's a big brute, isn't he??
          Liz chuckles.

          JOHANN
          But he has a good heart. I know it. He
          means well.

          LIZ
          I think I may have made a mistake.

          JOHANN
          In what way, Mein Frau??

          LIZ
          Just a mistake- nothing important.

          (SIGHS)
          But sometimes being with him is not easy-

          JOHANN
          It never is. I know.
          Lis looks at him with renewed interest.

          JOHANN
          I was married once. A long, long time
          ago... And only after I lost her- I
          realized that my life would never be
          quite the same- And my loss lead me to
          become what I am today...
          Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet.

          JOHANN
          I- I tried constantly to make contact
          with her-

          DISSOLVE STARTS :

           - SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 104

          104 FLASHBACK - CIRCA 2001
          Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril
          of ectoplasm. His neck engorges and the substance continues
          to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips--

          JOHANN
          It was only there- in the Ethereal plane
          that I ever gazed upon her again...
          CAMERA close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the
          room. Their flame illuminating the eerie scene.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 71
          Out of the mouths of the other guests, emerge other, equally
          large ectoplasmic shapes.
          They cross to-

          105 THE ETHEREAL PLANE 105
          Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
          reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
          JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
          the void: That of a woman, his wife.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          But it was there, while he was partially
          on the ethereal plane, that disaster

          STRUCK-
          He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible
          rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and
          distorting everything around him-
          His wife's shape screams and evaporates.

          106 INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 106

          BPRD agents break in on the scene. Smoke and flames billow
          in the room, wax puddles stand where the CEREMONIAL CANDLES
          were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
          hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a
          pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness:
          It's Johann.

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          All the seance attendees were
          incinerated. The only survivor -and only
          to some extent- was me- Why? I'll never

          KNOW--
          The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back
          and reanimate it, but the CHARRED CORPSE is barely amble to
          amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and
          bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
          Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and
          approaches the form-

          JOHANN'S VOICE
          It was then that Professor Broom and the
          B.P.R.D. devised a containment suit for
          me. A new body-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 72
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal-

          107 BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 107
          Johann, back in the balcony, talking to Liz.

          JOHANN
          I owe Professor Broom everything that
          I've become. He brought me back to life-
          He grows silent for a brief moment.

          JOHANN
          But I've never been able to see her
          again. My reach became limited- My loss,
          infinite...
          Liz puts her hand on his shoulder. Johann takes it...

          JOHANN
          Loss- the very threat of it makes us
          vulnerable... makes us care- You can see
          that, don't you?? Without her I became
          but an empty shell...
          Liz leans her head on his shoulder.

          JOHANN
          Don't give up on him. Not yet.
          Liz chuckles.

          LIZ
          No. Not yet.
          CAMERA discovers HELLBOY, watching them from behind a glass
          door, a six-pack in his hand. He steps away.

          108 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 108

          Heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six
          pack.
          He stops, puzzled. Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating
          from the library.

          109 INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 109

          Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank. Abe is
          there, listening to Vivaldi.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 73

          ABE
          Ah, hello Red. You're up late.

          HELLBOY
          Liz and I- we had a fight-

          ABE

          OH-
          Hellboy eyes the CD player.

          HELLBOY
          Did I hear Barry Manilow just now?

          ABE
          (smiles hypocritical)
          Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no-
          (fast, stammering)
          It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento
          dell'armonia I believe I particularly
          admire the passage...
          Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music
          stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer.

          HELLBOY
          What's happening to you??

          ABE
          Ooh- Ooh-

          (SIGHS)
          All my life I thought I was alone, a made-
          up name and a random pasted on a
          cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like
          me. A creature from another world...
          Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in
          love.

          HELLBOY
          You say that like it's a good thing.
          (looks at the CD)
          What track?

          ABE

          (ASHAMED)
          Track eight-

          HELLBOY

          (READS)
          Oh, God- you're disgusting-

          ABE
          I know-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 74

          HELLBOY
          "Can't smile without you"

          ABE
          I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for
          it..

          (DESPERATE)
          What am I going to do, Red????
          Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs
          heavily, looks around-

          ABE
          I miss him- Father- don't you??

          HELLBOY

          (NODS)
          Everyday.

          ABE
          He would tell what to do- He would tell
          what's right- what's wrong-

          HELLBOY
          He did that for all of us...
          The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You."

          ABE
          (sips beer)
          You know? I- I never much appreciated
          Manilow's artistry that much- until now-
          Now it seems to be a grand poet and
          speaks directly to my innermost feelings.

          HELLBOY
          Jeez- You need to get out more-
          The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the
          syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing:
          low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and
          teary-eyed.

          110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT

          The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then
          feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the
          panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the
          distant city lights below...

          The music can be heard at a distance.
          A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening
          and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the

          Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD
          team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.

          MANNING
          This is a whole new ballgame and I want
          you to take my lead.

          ABE
          I find these leather outfits very

          UNCOMFORTABLE-

          MANNING
          Maybe so, maybe so- but they look- hip.

          (BEAT)
          When it comes to dealing with reporters
          or the public, I set the tone. You all
          know the old saying: the perception is
          the reality.

          HELLBOY
          Correctamundo, chief. For one thing, we
          can ditch the garbage truck, right?

          ABE
          Wait, Red, the lab's in it-

          HELLBOY
          Screw the lab. I want new wheels.

          HELLBOY 2 76

          MANNING
          A gift from General Motors. One for each
          of you.
          Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of
          Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an
          underwater vista.

          HELLBOY
          This is more like it!

          LIZ
          I'm not driving that-
          Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer.

          ABE
          This is a most unfortunate vehicle. The
          sheer waste of precious fossil fuels...

          MANNING
          An American custom, it's called product
          placement! What's the harm?

          114 EXT. NEW YORK STREET

          A mob of SCREAMING FANS outside the TV studio. The frenzy
          intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up.
          As the BPRD team exits the cars, autograph seekers break
          through the POLICE LINE and swarm around the heroes.

          MANNING
          Every agent on the field is on the case.
          They will solve it--
          Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish.

          HELLBOY
          There you go, pal. "To Jason, best
          wishes, Hellboy."

          FAN
          (squints at the signature)
          How am I supposed to read that?

          HELLBOY 2 77
          Irritated, he scowls at the fan. Manning takes him by the
          elbow and leads him away.

          HELLBOY
          (to the fan)
          That turns up on e-Bay, I'm gonna find

          A row of makeup chairs. Manning sits in the first one,

          Can you do anything about this... uh...
          (lowers his voice)
          -double chin?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          No, you're not being made up.

          MANNING
          Why not?

          MAKEUP GIRL
          They said, you're too normal. You don't
          need anything.

          MANNING
          But- Believe me- I'm not normal at
          all...

          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl
          holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe.

          MAKEUP GIRL 2
          So, what color is that- green?

          ABE
          Carribbean Blue, actually.
          CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy
          Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest.

          (long beat, then sotto voce)
          -it's not a good idea to hint that you

          HELLBOY
          Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that.

          JOHANN
          You don't know how people may react.

          HELLBOY
          It's a love story. They'll lap it up.

          I know you don't like me, but trust me on
          this one.

          (BEAT)
          I knew your father- he was a friend-
          Hellboy blinks, taking the information in.

          JOHANN
          Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't
          have approved of your behaviour.
          A P.A. opens the door.

          Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the

          Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to

          Hellboy's attack.

          Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
          his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
          spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
          The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
          each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
          thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
          display case full of antique weapons.
          The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
          floor.

          He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
          his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
          combination.
          In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
          and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
          lips.

          ABE
          (seeing this)
          H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!

          The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
          breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
          SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
          collapses.
          The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
          His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.

          (showing off the Princess)
          If you want to see her again, you'll give

          134 INT. BPRD CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          Johann walks into the control room. In every screen a crisis
          situation is visible. JAGGED, BLURRY FOOTAGE shows a Yeti at
          large in Nebraska and a Plesiosaurus at large in Scotland,
          etc, etc-

          AGENT AGATE
          A lupgarou loose in Picadilly, a Winged
          creature nesting in a skyscraper- We have
          a situation in almost every point of the
          map.
          Johann looks back at a map with LED indicators signaling
          each crisis in the globe. They keep turning on a dozen a
          second.

          JOHANN
          The Rebellion's spreading too fast- The
          only way to stop it is to stop the
          Prince.

          135 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 135

          Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins
          of his tank.
          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
          Eyre."
          He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.

          LIZ
          Any luck?
          Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious
          thing in his webbed hand.

          ABE
          No. Sorry.

          LIZ
          It doesn't matter.

          ABE
          No -?

          LIZ
          No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just
          find this royal asshole.

          (FIERCE)
          Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll
          kick his ass.
          Abe looks supremely troubled.

          LIZ
          Abe, let's do this for Red!
          Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck
          the gold piece into his belt.

          CUT TO:

          136 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 136

          Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of
          the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces
          the strange, elvish text.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 90

          ABE
          The map contained within the cylinder
          seems useless-

          (BEAT)
          Now the case itself proves very useful-
          He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
          and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
          and coordinates become visible.
          A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.

          ABE
          Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
          brother were born there. They hold it
          sacred.

          MANNING
          Even if you're right, we sit tight and
          locate the gold piece, make sure he never
          ever gets his hands on it. If there's any
          truth to this legend, the fate of the
          world depends on it.

          LIZ
          What about Red?? Don't you care about
          him???
          A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally:

          JOHANN
          Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is
          right: we can't take the chance.
          Liz glares at him.

          LIZ
          I see. Red was right about you. Welcome
          to the team, Johann. And goodbye.
          She leaves the room.

          CUT TO:

          137 INT. HB'S ROOM - LATER 137

          Hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His
          cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by
          the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 91

          HELLBOY
          Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be

          ALRIGHT-
          Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed.

          ABE
          We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You
          are right, Liz- We should just do this
          together: the three of us.
          Liz smiles.

          CUT TO:

          138 INT. PLANE - NIGHT 138

          The BPRD airplane sits quietly in its hangar. In the
          passenger compartment, Hellboy climbs up. He looks up to see
          Liz smiling down at him.

          139 INT. COCKPIT - SAME 139

          Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the
          massive airplane manual.

          ABE
          Engine, starting- refer to NA-7488-BD...
          Liz climbs in behind him.

          LIZ
          We stay here much longer, we're gonna get
          caught...

          ABE
          Just a few more minutes. Here's an easy
          way to remember that "port" means "left."
          They each have four-
          A NOISE from the door: it's Johann.

          JOHANN
          Good evening, friends.

          LIZ
          Don't try to stop us, Johann.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 92

          JOHANN
          On the contrary. I've been giving it some
          thought, and we should be able to save
          Hellboy. After all, the Prince lacks the
          gold crown. Without it, his army poses no
          threat. None at all.
          Abe is very quiet.

          ABE
          (in despair)
          Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot
          this thing...
          Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the
          controls...

          JOHANN
          I'll give it a try-
           Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up.

           140

          140 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - SAME

          Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the BPRD
          corridors. As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his
          cup, a couple of AGENTS run up.

          AGENT
          Sir - you'd better come, fast -

          MANNING
          Got it - ow!
          He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the
          agents.

          141

          141 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

          The BPRD airplane is ROARING, amid clouds of exhaust fumes.
          The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing
          tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves.
          A bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning
          arrives.

          MANNING
          Not ALL of them, it's not possible!

          AGENT
          Isn't that Johann at the controls?

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 93
          Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head
          through the cockpit window. Abe's there, too. He raises a
          webbed hand to wave goodbye.
          The plane taxis outside onto the runway...

          142 EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT 142

          .and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New
          Jersey treetops.

          CUT TO:

          143 UNDERGROUND 143
          The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring
          tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
          stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
          trolls, faeries and ogres.

          PRINCE
          Maybe this will help you remember who we
          are, who you are... What our destiny is-
          The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto

          A-

          144 LEDGE 144
          -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a
          thousand torches. The mechanical ARMY stands knee-deep in
          heaving seawater and foam.

          PRINCE
          They - they - will be mine to command,
          whether you like it or not. Only after
          our victory will you appreciate my
          sacrifice... and yours.

          145 EXT. BPRD PLANE - DAY 145

          The BPRD plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent
          upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 94
          Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green
          valley.

          146 TNT. BPRD PLANE COCKPIT - DAY 146
          Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans
          in Liz's arms.

          HELLBOY
          (to Liz)
          Where are we, Liz..?

          LIZ
          Near the ocean, Red.We'regonna make you
          well here.

          147 EXT.OPEN FIELD,IRELAND - DAY 147


          148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148
          The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and

          JOHANN-

          149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149

          Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by
          eons of wind.
          Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar,
          weird tree.

          ABE
          This should be the portal. By all rights-
          Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.

          JOHANN
          Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest
          branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its
          crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a
          perfect fit.

          LIZ
          Yes! Try it, Abe-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 95

          JOHANN
          Before you do anything... remember what
          we're in for. A world unlike anything
          we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive...

          LIZ
          You're wasting time!
          Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.
          The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground,
          bending them into a swaying arch.

          JOHANN
          Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
          leave.
           They walk under the tree roots, into...

           150

          150 FAIRY WORLD
          A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still
          overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale
          colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours.
          The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a
          rugged coastline.

          CUT TO:

          151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151

          The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe
          brings out the map.

          ABE
          (pointing to the opposite shore)
          Renvyle is over there.
          They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
          Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
          shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.

          GOBLIN
          I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you
          be seeking safe passage to Renvyle?

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 96

          LIZ
          Yes! Can you help us?

          JOHANN

          (QUIET)
          Careful, Liz.

          SATYR
          I'm sure you can come to an
          understanding!
          The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
          rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
          coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.

          GOBLIN
          Room enough for all of you!
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Even your weary friend.

          JOHANN
          What will it cost, boatman?
          The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of
          triangular teeth.

          GOBLIN
          Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer.
          Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves:

          LIZ
          How much?

          CROW
          He won't want money.

          JOHANN
          (to the goblin)
          I have a... belt!

          OF
          Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front
          the creature's bat-like face.

          GOBLIN
          I have no use for such a thing.
          Liz shows him her binoculars.

          LIZ
          Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic
          eyes that will bring the world-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 97

          GOBLIN
          I already have binoculars! No, I see
          something special.
          He points toward Hellboy's chest.

          SATYR
          Under his bandage - !
          Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and
          brings out a KNIFE! SWISH! In one sweep of the blade, he
          reveals HB's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding
          from it.

          GOBLIN
          That!
          (points at the steel)
          That - in exchange for your crossing!

          LIZ
          Don't you touch it - !
          She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready
          for a fight. The Goblin shrugs.

          GOBLIN
          Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it
          out.

          ABE
          You mustn't. One touch can kill him.
          The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding.

          GOBLIN
          Ah. I see. We must go to the Angel of

          DEATH-

          CROW
          He'll know what to do.

          152 EXT. INLET - DAY 152

          The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as
          the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
          cove.
          The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
          help Hellboy up.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 98
          Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
          MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
          the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
          eyeless face.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          So. This one... The boy- I remember him
          well! Anung-un-Rama!

          LIZ
          Oh, my God. She knows - ?!

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          I helped bring him into this world - in
          my fashion.
          It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot TONGS out of the fire.
          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.

          ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)
          I warn you: it is his destiny to rule
          over the destruction of the Earth. Not
          now, not tomorrow - but some day. You are
          sure you want him to live?

          LIZ
          Yes, I say yes-!
          Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Very well, then- but let it be said: The
          day will come when you will pay the price
          fire girl: This will bring you and the
          world much sorrow.

          LIZ
          And I'll deal with it when that time
          comes. Now save him.
          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 99
          The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
          with distaste.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Harmless now.
          (looking at Hellboy)
          See - ?
          Hellboy's eyes flutter open.

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          (to Hellboy)
          Sleep now, child. Your strength, it will
          return.
          A guttural HISS from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up
          and down, pointing at the speartip.

          JOHANN
          Our ferry captain - he wants his
          payment...

          ANGEL OF DEATH
          Ach, outside with you!
          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.

          CUT TO:

          153 EXT.. HILLTOP - DAY 153

          Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.

          154 EXT. HUT - DAY 154

          Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
          blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
          who is happy now.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 100

          LIZ
          I almost lost you-
          Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand-

          HELLBOY
          I thought you were mad at me.

          LIZ
          Well, no one can stay mad forever.

          HELLBOY
          I'm sorry for all the attention, I
          thought it would be good for us.

          LIZ
          We're never going to make them all happy,
          Red. What we have is ours and no one

          ELSE'S-

          BELLBOY
          I can turn my back on the world. I don't
          care anymore I don't- as long as you stay
          with me- as long as you think I'm still a
          good man.

          (BEAT )
          Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I??

          LIZ
          Yes you are. You are the best man I've
          ever met.

          HELLBOY
          You still seem sad. Is there anything you
          want to tell me-??

          LIZ
          Yes, there is-

          HELLBOY
          Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm
          ready.

          (SIGHS)
          Is it about Johann-

          LIZ
          No- no- what are you talking about??
          Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
          and fresh rags.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 101

          JOHANN
          Abe and I have found the entrance to the
          Golden Army's resting place- Liz come
          with us-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          You should stay behind and get some rest-

          HELLBOY
          And call you in the morning, right?? Like
          Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,

          GLASSHOLE-

          CUT TO:

          155

          155 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,

          WAVING-

          JOHANN
          There.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-

          ABE
          The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.

          BELLBOY
          Strange. If this is the entrance-

          ABE
          I know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 102
          He hits Wink again and again-

          HELLBOY
          See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-

          HELLBOY
          Ouch- ouch- ouch-
          (looking around)
          We better go swimming before any more
          ugly fellas show up-
          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.

          ABE
          Red, are you-?

          HELLBOY
          Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-

          156

          156 UNDERWATER
          Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.

          157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157

          As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.

          JOHANN
          Hang on, people. I'll be right back.

          158

          158 UNDERWATER
          Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.

          

          

          

          

          BELLBOY 2 103
          Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...

          159 A STAIRWELL 159
          .carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
          depths of the cliff.

          CUT TO:

          160 STAIRS - LATER 160
          The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
          with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
          He dabs at his chest with a rag.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          Hold up. We need to rest.

          HELLBOY
          Says who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.

          LIZ
          (to Johann)
          This was a mistake. He's -

          JOHANN
          Mein Gott--
          The stairs lead to-

          161 INT. CAVERN 161

          -a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
          flickering.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
          SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 104

          162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
          Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.

          HELLBOY
          Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.

          JOHANN
          Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.

          LIZ
          Make that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.

          HELLBOY
          Wow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...

          HELLBOY
          Uh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,

          -
          the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!

          HELLBOY
          Whoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 105

          PRINCE
          As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
          soldiers. So do you, I see.
          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.

          HELLBOY
          Yeah. Now it's your turn.

          PRINCE
          Do you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.

          PRINCE
          These fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.

          AS
          From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
          he fits them together...

          PRINCE
          You have the remaining piece, I presume.

          JOHANN
          We do not -

          PRINCE

          (SURPRISED)
          Then you are most foolish.
          He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
          They lead the Princess out in chains.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          You came here expecting what? Mercy?

          JOHANN
          The death you would unleash will never
          happen! What you need is far from here
          and will stay out of your reach forever.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 106
          A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
          them.

          ABE
          Stop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.

          ABE

          (APPROACHING)
          Here... For her... Take it...

          JOHANN
          Oh, my God. What has he done?
          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.

          HELLBOY
          Abe -

          ABE
          (to Hellboy)
          You cannot fight him- not without hurting
          her...

          (BEAT )
          What would you do if it was Liz??
          CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
          the resulting crown on his head!

          PRINCE
          I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
          to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
          right?
          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.

          PRINCE (CONT'D)
          (points at the team)
          Kill them.
          Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.

          ABE
          (to the Prince)
          That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
          paid in good faith!!

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           HELLBOY 2 107
          ABE(continued)
           (to Hellboy)
          Why, he lied to us!

          HELLBOY
          Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.

          ABE
          He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
          highborn heir to the throne, last in a
          noble line of-

          BELLBOY
          Not now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.

          LIZ
          Let me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.

          JOHANN
          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 108
          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.

          JOHANN
          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.

          HELLBOY
          (a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
          command this army!
          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.

          ABE
          (follows HB)
          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.

          HELLBOY
          A challenge must be answered! Raise your
          sword!

          PRINCE
          A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
          no one.

          PRINCESS
          No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
          Fallen one- He has the right!
          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 10 9

          PRINCE
          Very well.
          (to the BPRD team)
          May his fate show you the cost of pride
          and blindness.
          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-

          JOHANN
          Hellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.

          LIZ
          (witness to a nightmare)
          No!! NO! !
          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.

          HELLBOY
          I- have- won-

          PRINCE
          No. You have not-

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 110
          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.

          ABE

          (GASPS)

          NO-
          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

          PRINCESS
          We'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:

          PRINCE
          (to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 111

          HELLBOY
          (to the trolls)
          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.

          DISSOLVE:

          163 EXT. HILLS - DAY

          The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.
          Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.

          164

          164 EXT. TREE -- DAY

          They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
          cylinder and fits it into the slot.

          JOHANN
          Any last minute requests?

          ABE
          (very quiet)
          Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.

          165

          165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY

          On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.

          MANNING

          (STARTLED)
          Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-

          BELLBOY
          I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.

          

          

          

          

          HELLBOY 2 112
          Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.

          ABE
          Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.

          MANNING
          What? What, exactly is this?

          ABE
          (walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.

          MANNING
          Come on. You're resigning?

          HELLBOY
          Looks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.

          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
          I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.

          MANNING
          Liz -- not you, too!?
          (to Johann)
          They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-

          JOHANN
          Manning, you're an asshole.

          166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166

          Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
          at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
          Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.
          Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds.

          
          

          BELLBOY 2 113

          LIZ
          What you said before - about us living

          ANYWHERE-

          HELLBOY
          I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA...
           but, hey - you decide.

           LIZ
           (breathing deep)
           Let's find a place in the country. Clean
          air - green hills - fresh milk from the
          farm.

          HELLBOY
          Milk? Yech.

          LIZ
          A yard... With lots of room to grow in.

          HELLBOY
          (he looks blank)
          Grow? who gonna grow- ?

          LIZ
          Our baby, that's who!

          HELLBOY
          Our b-?
          On Hellboy's immense grin: FREEZE FRAME. Roll CREDITS.
          At the end of the credits-

          POST CREDIT SEQUENCE

          167 EXT. ANTARTICA - DAY

          5 ZINCO ENTERPRISES helicopters land on the hard, icy
          surface of Amundsen's glacier. A row of GUARDS in black
          garb flank each helicopter.
          Out of one of them exits RODERICK ZINCO, billionare, madman.
          He carries a mechanized container, a little larger than a
          hat box. CAMERA follows as he enters through a crevace and..

          Light shines through the ice walls and into rows and rows of
          machinery.
