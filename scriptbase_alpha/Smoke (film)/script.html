<pre>
1.	EXT:  DAY.  ELEVATED SUBWAY TRAIN

Against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline, we see an elevated
subway train heading toward Brooklyn.

After a moment, we begin to hear voices. An animated discussion is
taking place inside the Brooklyn Cigar Company.

2. 	INT:  DAY.  THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

The cigar shop from within. Displays of cigar boxes, a wall of
magazines, piles of newspapers. cigarettes, smoking paraphernalia. On
the walls, we see framed black-and-white photographs of people smoking
cigars: Groucho Marx, George Burns, Clint Eastwood, Edward G. Robinson,
Orson Welles, Charles Laughton, Frankenstein's monster, Leslie Caron,
Ernie Kovacs.

Words appear on the screen: "SUMMER 1990."

AUGGIE WREN is behind the counter. Somewhere between forty and fifty
years old, AUGGIE is a scruffy presence: unkempt hair, a two-day
stubble of beard, dressed in blue jeans and a black T-shirt. We see an
intricate tattoo on one arm.

It is a slow hour. AUGGIE is flipping through a photography magazine.

Near the counter are the three OTB MEN. These are local characters who
like to hang out in the store, shooting the breeze with AUGGIE. One is
black (TOMMY) and the other two are white (JERRY and DENNIS). DENNIS
wears a T-shirt with the following words printed across the front: "If
life is a dream, what happens when I wake up?"

		TOMMY
	I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.

		JERRY
	Yeah? And why is that?

		TOMMY
	Management. Those guys are walking around with
	their heads up their asses.

		DENNIS
	They made some great deals. Tommy. Hernandez.
	Carter. Without those two, there never woulda
	been no World Series.

		TOMMY
	That was four years ago. I'm talking about now.
		(Growing more intense)
	Look who they got rid of. Mitchell. Backman.
	McDowell. Dykstra. Aguillera. Mookie. Mookie
	Wilson, for Chrissakes.
		(Shakes his head)

		JERRY
		(Sarcastically)
	And Nolan Ryan. Don't forget him.

 		DENNIS
		(Chiming in)
	Yeah. And Amos Otis.

		TOMMY
		(Shrugs)
	Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.

		JERRY
	Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You
	got your good trades and your bad trades.
	That's how it works.

		TOMMY
	They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm
	saying. The team was good, the best fucking
	team in baseball. But then they had to screw it
	up.
 		(Pause)
	They traded their birthright for a mess of
	porridge.
		(Shakes his head)
	A mess of porridge.

The bells on the door jangle as someone enters. It is AUGGIE'S protégé,
JIMMY ROSE, a mentally retarded man in his late twenties. He has been
sweeping the sidewalk outside the store and holds a broom in his right
hand.

		AUGGIE
	How'd you do out there, Jimmy?

		JIMMY
	Good, Auggie. Real good.
		(Proudly thrusts out broom)
	All finished.

		AUGGIE
  		(Philosophically)
	It'll never be finished.

		JIMMY
		(Confused)
	Huh?

		AUGGIE
	That's how it is with sidewalks. People come,
	people go, and they all drop shit on the
	ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and
	move on to the next, the first spot is dirty
	again.

		JIMMY
		(Trying to digest AUGGIE'S comment)
	I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me
	to sweep, so I sweep.

The bells on the door jangle again, and a customer enters the store: a
middle-class man in his early thirties. He walks to the counter as
JERRY teases JIMMY. In the background, we see him talking to AUGGIE.
AUGGIE pulls some cigar boxes out of the display case and puts them on
the counter for the YOUNG MAN to inspect. In the foreground we see:

		JERRY
		(Interrupting. Playfully)
	Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?

		JIMMY
		(Turning to the SECOND OTB MAN)
	Huh?

		JERRY
	You still have that watch Auggie gave you?

		JIMMY
		(Holds up left wrist showing
		 cheap digital watch. Smiles)
	Tick-tock, tick-tock.

		JERRY
	So what's the time?

		JIMMY
		(Studying watch)
	Twelve-eleven.
		(Pause, marveling as
		 the numbers change)
	Twelve-twelve.
		(Looks up, smiling)
	Twelve-twelve.

A sudden outburst is heard from the area near the counter.

		YOUNG MAN
		(Aghast)
	Ninety-two dollars?

The focus of the scene shifts to AUGGIE and the YOUNG MAN.

		AUGGIE
	They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys
	are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical
	climate, most likely by an eighteen year old
	girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear
	on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked
	cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly
	turning out one masterpiece after another...

		YOUNG MAN
 		(Pointing)
	And how much are these?

		AUGGIE
	Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these
	was probably wearing panties.

		YOUNG MAN
		(Pointing)
	And these?

		AUGGIE
 	Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.

		YOUNG MAN
		(Pointing)
	And these?

		AUGGIE
	Forty-four. They're on special this week from
	the Canary Islands. A real bargain.

                    YOUNG MAN
	I think I'll take them.
		(Takes wallet from his pocket
		 and counts out $50 which he
		 hands to AUGGIE)

		AUGGIE
	A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate
	the birth of your firstborn with a box of
	stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in
	the refrigerator until you hand them out.

                    YOUNG MAN
	The refrigerator?

		AUGGIE
	It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry,
	they'll break. And you don't want that to
	happen, do you?
		(Putting cigar box into a bag,
		 ringing up sale on the cash register)
	Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same
	loving care you'd give an orchid.

                    YOUNG MAN
	Thanks for the tip.

		AUGGIE
	Any time. And congratulations to you and your
	wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal
	words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a
	woman, but a cigar is a smoke.

		YOUNG MAN
		(Confused)
	What does that mean?

		AUGGIE
	Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it,
	don't it?

At that moment, we hear the bells on the door jangle again. Cut to the
door. Another customer enters the store: PAUL BENJAMIN. He is in his
early forties, dressed in rumpled casual clothes. As he approaches the
counter, the YOUNG MAN brushes past him and leaves the store. The OTB
MEN and JIMMY look on as PAUL and AUGGIE talk.

		PAUL
 	Hey, Auggie. How's it going?

		AUGGIE
	Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?

		PAUL
	Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a
	lighter while you're at it.

                      AUGGIE
		(Reaching for cigars and lighter)
	The boys and I were just having a philosophical
	discussion about women and cigars. Some
	interesting connections there, don't you think?

		PAUL
		(Laughs)
	Definitely.
		(Pause)
	I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.

                      AUGGIE
	The Queen of England?

		PAUL
	Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.
		(Pause)
	Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?

		TOMMY
	Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down
	over the puddle.

		JERRY
	I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came
	with a free gift coupon in every pack.

		PAUL
	That's the man. Well, Raleigh was the person
	who introduced tobacco in England, and since he
	was a favorite of the Queen's -- Queen Bess, he
	used to call her -- smoking caught on as a
	fashion at court. I'm sure Old Bess must have
	shared a stogie or two with Sir Walter. Once,
	he made a bet with her that he could measure
	the weight of smoke.

		DENNIS
	You mean, weigh smoke?

		PAUL
	Exactly. Weigh smoke.

		TOMMY
	You can't do that. It's like weighing air.

		PAUL
	I admit it's strange. Almost like weighing
	someone's soul. But Sir Walter was a clever
	guy. First, he took an unsmoked cigar and put
	it on a balance and weighed it. Then he lit up
	and smoked the cigar, carefully tapping the
	ashes into the balance pan. When he was
	finished, he put the butt into the pan along
	with the ashes and weighed what was there.
	Then he subtracted that number from the
	original weight of the unsmoked cigar. The
	difference was the weight of the smoke.

		TOMMY
	Not bad. That's the kind of guy we need to take
	over the Mets.

		PAUL
	Oh, he was smart, all right. But not so smart
	that he didn't wind up having his head chopped
	off twenty years later.
		(Pause)
	But that's another story.

		AUGGIE
		(Handing PAUL his change and putting
		 cigar tins and lighter in a paper bag)
	Seven eighty-five out of twenty.
		(As PAUL turns to leave)
	Take care of yourself now, and don't do
	anything I wouldn't do.

		PAUL
		(Smiling)
	I wouldn't think of it.
		(Waves casually to the OTB MEN)
	See you around, fellas.

AUGGIE and the OTB MEN watch as PAUL leaves the store.

		TOMMY
		(Turning to AUGGIE)
	What is he, some kind of wise guy?

		AUGGIE
	Nah. He's a good kid.

		JERRY
	I've seen him around. He comes in here a lot,
	don't he?

		AUGGIE
	Couple of times a week, maybe. He's a writer.
	Lives in the neighborhood.

		TOMMY
	And what kind of writer is he? An underwriter?

		AUGGIE
		(Peeved)
	Very funny. Some of the cracks you make. Tommy,
	sometimes I think you should see a doctor. You
	know, go in for some wit therapy or something.
	To clean out the valves in your brain.

		TOMMY
		(A little embarrassed. Shrugs)
	It was just a joke.

		AUGGIE
	The guy's a novelist. Paul Benjamin. You ever
	hear of him?
		(Pause)
	That's a stupid question. The only things you
	guys read is the Racing Form and pages of the
	Post.
		(Pause)
	He's published three or four books.  But
	nothing now for the past few years.

		DENNIS
	What's the matter? He run out of ideas?

		AUGGIE
	He ran out of luck.
		(Pause)
	Remember that holdup out here on Seventh Avenue
	few years back?

		JERRY
	You talking about the bank? The time those two
	guys started spraying bullets all over the
	street?

		AUGGIE
	That's it. Four people got killed. One of them
	was Paul's wife.
		(Pause)
	The poor lug, he hasn't been the same since.
		(Pause)
	The funny thing was, she stopped in here just
	before it happened. To stock up on cigars for
	him. She was a nice lady, Ellen. Four or five
	months pregnant at the time, which means that
	when she was killed, the baby was killed, too.

		TOMMY
	Bad day at Black Rock, eh, Auggie?

Close-up of AUGGIE'S face. Remembering.

		AUGGIE
	It was bad, all right. I sometimes think that
	if she hadn't given me exact change that day,
	or if the store had been a little more crowded,
	it would have taken her a few more seconds to
	get out of here, and then maybe she wouldn't
	have stepped in front of that bullet. She'd
	still be alive, the baby would have been born,
	and Paul would be sitting at home writing
	another book instead of wandering the streets
	with a hangover.
		(Pensive, his expression suddenly
		 turns to one of alarm)

Cut to white youth in the corner of the store, shoving paperback books
into the pockets of his tattered army fatigue jacket.

		AUGGIE (cont'd)
	Hey! What are you doing there, kid? Hey, cut
	that out!

AUGGIE scrambles out from behind the counter, pushing his way past the
OTB MEN as the kid takes off and runs out of the store.

3.	EXT: DAY. SEVENTH AVENUE

AUGGIE chases the BOOK THIEF down the street. Eventually, he gets
winded and gives up. He pauses for a moment to catch his breath, then
turns around and heads back in the direction of the store.

4.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT.  A BROWNSTONE BUILDING IN PARK SLOPE
(THIRD FLOOR)

Shot of a little brown cigar, burning in an ashtray.

The camera pulls back to reveal PAUL at his desk. He is writing in
longhand, using a pad of yellow legal paper. An old Smith-Corona
typewriter is also on the desk, poised for work with a half-written
page in the roller. Off in the corner, we see a neglected word
processor.

The workroom is a bare and simple place. Desk, chair, and a small
wooden bookcase with manuscripts and papers shoved onto its shelves.
The window faces a brick wall.

As PAUL continues to write, the camera travels from the workroom into
the larger of the two rooms that make up his apartment.

This larger room is an all-purpose space that includes a sleeping area,
a kitchenette in one corner, a dining table and a large easy chair.
Crowded bookshelves occupy one wall from floor to ceiling. The bow
windows face front, looking down onto the street. Near the bed, we see
a framed photograph of a young woman. (This is Ellen, Paul's dead
wife.)

The camera travels back into the workroom. We see PAUL at work. Fade
out.

Fade in. We see PAUL at his desk, eating a TV dinner while still
writing in the pad. After a moment, he inadvertently knocks the food
off the desk with his elbow. He begins to bend over to pick up the
food, but as he does so a new idea suddenly occurs to him. Instead of
cleaning up the mess, he turns back to his pad and continues writing.

5	EXT: DAY. IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

We see PAUL walking out of the cigar store. JIMMY ROSE is on the
corner, observing him throughout the scene. PAUL takes three or four
steps, then realizes he has forgotten something. He goes back into the
store. During his brief absence, JIMMY remains on the corner, imitating
PAUL'S gestures: patting in pockets, looking puzzled, realizing that he
has forgotten the cigars he just bought.

PAUL comes out again a moment later, holding a tin of Schimmelpenninck
cigars. He pauses, takes a cigar out of the tin, and lights up. He
continues walking, obviously distracted. He stops briefly at a corner,
then steps out into the street, paying no attention to the traffic. A
speeding tow truck is rushing toward the intersection. At the last
second, a black hand reaches out, grabs PAUL by the arm, and pulls him
back to the curb. If not for that timely move, PAUL would surely have
been run down.

We see PAUL'S rescuer: it is RASHID COLE, a black adolescent of sixteen
or seventeen. He is tall and well built for his age. A nylon backpack
is slung over his left shoulder.

		RASHID
	Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like
	that.

		PAUL
		(Badly shaken, still
		 clinging to RASHID'S arm)
	I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm
	walking around in a fog ...

		RASHID
	No harm done. Everything's okay now.
		(Looks down and notices that he and
		 PAUL are still gripping each other's
		 arms. Tries to pull away)
	I've got to be going.

		PAUL
		(Still rattled. Begins to loosen grip,
		 then grabs hold of RASHID'S again)
	No, wait. You can't just walk off.
		(Pause)
	You saved my life.

		RASHID
		(Shrugs)
	I just happened to be there.  The right place
	at the right time.

		PAUL
		(Relaxes grip on RASHID'S arm)
	I owe you something.

		RASHID
	It's okay, mister. No big deal.

		PAUL
	Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let
	you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit
	... pestilence will reign over the city for a
	hundred years.

		RASHID
		(Mystified, amused. Smiles faintly)
	Well, if you put it that way...

		PAUL
	You have to let me do something for you to put
	the scales in balance.

		RASHID
		(Thinks, shakes his head)
	That's all right. If I think of something, I'll
	send my butler over to tell you.

		PAUL
	Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of
	coffee.

		RASHID
	I don't drink coffee.
		(Smiles)
	On the other hand, since you insist, if you
	offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.

		PAUL
	Good. Lemonade it is.
		(Pause. Extends right hand)
	I'm Paul.

		RASHID
	Rashid. Rashid Cole.
		(Shakes PAUL'S hand)

Cut to:

6.	INT: DAY. GREEK DINER IN PARK SLOPE

PAUL and RASHID are sitting in a booth. The restaurant is nearly empty.
We see RASHID finishing his second lemonade.

		PAUL
		(Watching RASHID drink)
	Are you sure you don't want some food to go
	along with it? It might help to absorb some of
	that liquid. You don't want to slosh around
	too much when you stand up.

		RASHID
 	That's okay. I've already had lunch.

		PAUL
		(Looks at clock on wall)
	You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only
	eleven o'clock.

		RASHID
	I mean breakfast.

		PAUL
		(Studying RASHID closely)
	Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last
	night. Along with two bottles of champagne.

		RASHID
	Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.

		PAUL
	Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to
	play games. If you want a hamburger or
	something, go ahead and order it.

		RASHID
		(Hesitates)
	Well, maybe just one. To be polite.

		PAUL
		(Turning to WAITRESS. She comes)
	Cocktail hour is over. The young man would
	like to order a hamburger.

		WAITRESS
		(To RASHID)
	How do you want that cooked?

		RASHID
	Medium rare, please.

		WAITRESS
	Fries?

		RASHID
		(Looks at PAUL. PAUL nods)
	Yes, please.

		WAITRESS
 	Lettuce and tomato?

		RASHID
		(Looks at PAUL. PAUL nods)
	Yes, please.

		WAITRESS
		(Pointing to RASHID'S empty
		 lemonade glass)
	You want another one of these, too?

		PAUL
	Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup
	of coffee while you're at it.

		WAITRESS
	Hot coffee or iced coffee?

		PAUL
	Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just
	pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?

		WAITRESS
	Everything is real in here, honey.
		(Pause)
	As real as the color of my hair.

PAUL and RASHID look at her hair. It is dyed bright red.

		PAUL
		(Deadpan)
	I'll take the iced coffee.
		(Pause)
	You only live once, right?

		WAITRESS
		(Equally deadpan)
	If you're lucky.
		(Pause)
	Then again, it depends on what you call living.
		(She walks off)

		PAUL
		(To RASHID)
	I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking
	around with a big knapsack on his back, and I
	begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions
	aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of
	trouble or what?

		RASHID
		(Keeping up his pose)
	Mostly what.

		PAUL
		(Studying RASHID)
	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to,
	but I might be able to help.

		RASHID
		(Hesitating)
	You don't know me from a hole in the wall.

		PAUL
	That's true. But I also owe you something, and
	I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is
	going to do the job.
		(Pause)
	What is it? Family problems? Money problems?

		RASHID
		(Imitating white upper-class accent)
	Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.

		PAUL
	And where do Momsie and Popsie live?

		RASHID
	East Seventy-fourth Street.

		PAUL
	In Manhattan?

		RASHID
	Of course. Where else?

		PAUL
	Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a
	little far from home, isn't it?

		RASHID
		(Beginning to relent)
	That's where the <i>what</i> comes in.

		PAUL
	The what?

		RASHID
	The what.
		(Pause)
	I've kind of run away from home, you see.
		(Pause)
	It has nothing to do with my parents or money.
	I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and
	for the time being it's best that I keep myself
	out of sight.

		PAUL
	You can't be more specific than that?

RASHID looks at PAUL, hesitates, then lowers his eyes.

		PAUL (cont'd)
		(Pause. Decides not to press him)
	So where have you been staying in the meantime?

		RASHID
	Here and there. Around.

 		PAUL
	Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast
	places, probably.

		RASHID
	Yeah, that's right.

		PAUL
	Except that there's no bed, is there? And no
	breakfast either.

		RASHID
	The material world is an illusion. It doesn't
	matter if they're there or not. The world is in
	my head.

		PAUL
	But your body is in the world, isn't it?
		(Pause)
	If someone offered you a place to stay, you
	wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?

		RASHID
		(Pause. Thinks)
	People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New
	York.

		PAUL
	I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do
	whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?

		RASHID
	Thanks, but I'll manage.

		PAUL
	In case you're wondering, I like women, not
	little boys. And I'm not offering you a
	long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a
	couple of nights.

		RASHID
 	I can take care of myself. Don't worry.

		PAUL
	Suit yourself. But if you change your mind,
	here's the address.
		(Takes out a pad from his pocket and
		 scribbles down the address. Tears
		 sheet from the pad and hands it to
		 RASHID)

The WAITRESS arrives with their orders.

		WAITRESS
	One burger medium rare with lettuce and tomato.
		(Setting down plate in front of RASHID)
	One order of fries.
		(Setting down plate)
	One lemonade.
		(Setting down glass)
	And one dose of reality.
		(Setting down iced coffee
		 in front of PAUL)

PAUL looks on as RASHID picks up hamburger and takes his first bite.

7.	INT: DAY. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

A slow hour. AUGGIE is sitting behind the counter, looking through a
magazine and eating a slice of pizza for lunch. VINNIE enters the
frame. He is the owner of the store: a large man in his fifties.

		VINNIE
	Okay. I think everything's set.
		(Lights up cigar)
	You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just
	in case something goes wrong.

		AUGGIE
		(Chewing pizza; not looking
		 up from magazine)
	No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.
		(Finally looking up)
	I could run this store in my sleep.

		VINNIE
		(Studying AUGGIE)
	How long you been working for me, Auggie?

		AUGGIE
		(Shrugs, looks down at magazine again)
	I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years.
	Something like that.

		VINNIE
	It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a
	smart guy like you. What do you want to hang
	on to a dead-end job like this for?

		AUGGIE
		(Shrugs again)
	I don't know.
		(Turns pages of magazine)
	Maybe because I love you so much, boss.

		VINNIE
	Shit. You should have been married to someone
	by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a
	kid or two, a nice steady job.

		AUGGIE
	I almost got married once.

		VINNIE
	Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to
	Pittsburgh.

		AUGGIE
	Ruby McNutt. My one true love.

		VINNIE
	Sounds like another one of your stories to me.

                      AUGGIE
		(Shakes his head)
	She upped and married some other cat after I
	joined the navy. By the time I got my
	discharge, though, she was divorced. Her
	husband poked out her eye in a domestic
	quarrel.

		VINNIE
		(Puffing on his cigar)
	Lovely.

                      AUGGIE
		(Remembering)
	She made a play for me after I got back, but
	her glass eye kept interfering with my
	concentration. Every time we got into a clinch,
	I'd start thinking about that hole in her head,
	that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An
	eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't
	shed any tears. The minute I started thinking
	about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and
	small. And I can't see getting married if Mr.
	Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.

		VINNIE
		(Shaking his head)
	You don't take anything seriously, do you?

		AUGGIE
	I try not to, anyway. It's better for your
	health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're
	the guy with the wife and three kids and the
	ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with
	the white shoes and the white Caddy and the
	white shag carpet. But you've had two heart
	attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.

		VINNIE
		(Takes cigar out of his mouth
		 and looks at it with disgust)
	I should stop smoking these damn things is what
	I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me
	one day.

		AUGGIE
	Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon,
	they're going to legislate us out of business
	anyway.

		VINNIE
	They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand
	you up against a wall and shoot you.

		AUGGIE
		(Nodding)
	Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four
	years, it'll probably be against the law to
	smile at strangers.

		VINNIE
		(Remembering something)
	Speaking of which, are you still going ahead
	with that deal on the Montecristos?

                      AUGGIE
	It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have
	them within the next few weeks.
		(Pause)
	Are you sure you don't want to go in with me?
	Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed
	ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of
	Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just
	drooling to get their lips around some genuine
	Cuban cigars.

		VINNIE
	No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just
	make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last
	I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban
	cigars in this country.

		AUGGIE
	It's the law that's buying. That's what's so
	beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last
	time you heard of a judge sending himself to
	jail?

		VINNIE
	Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around
	here long.

		AUGGIE
	They come in, they go out. I've got it planned
	to the last detail.

		VINNIE
		(Looking at his watch)
	I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my
	chops if I'm late. See you in September,
	Auggie.

		AUGGIE
	Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et
	cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you
	can remember the address.

VINNIE leaves. AUGGIE turns back to his pizza and magazine.

8. EXT: EVENING. FACADE OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

A shot of the darkening sky. A shot of the cigar store. We see the
lights go out. AUGGIE comes outside, locks the door, and begins pulling
down the metal gate in front of the windows. Cut to:

A shot of PAUL running down the street toward AUGGIE.

		PAUL
		(Out of breath)
	Are you closed?

		AUGGIE
	You run out of Schimmelpennincks?

		PAUL
		(Nods)
	Do you think I could buy some before you leave?

		AUGGIE
	No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off
	to the opera or anything.

AUGGIE lifts the gate and the two of them go into the store.

9. INT: EVENING. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

PAUL and AUGGIE enter the darkened store. AUGGIE turns on the lights
and then goes behind the counter to fetch PAUL'S cigars. PAUL, on the
other side, notices a 35-millimeter camera near the cash register.

		PAUL
	Looks like someone forgot a camera.

		AUGGIE
		(Turning around)
	Yeah, I did.

		PAUL
	It's yours?

		AUGGIE
	It's mine all right. I've owned that little
	sucker for a long time.

		PAUL
	I didn't know you took pictures.

		AUGGIE
		(Handing PAUL his cigars)
	I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't
	take me more than about five minutes a day to
	do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine,
	sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.
		(Pause)
	Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job,
	and my job is just a way to support my hobby.

		PAUL
	So you're not just some guy who pushes coins
	across a counter.

		AUGGIE
	That's what people see, but that ain't
	necessarily what I am.

		PAUL
		(Looking at AUGGIE with new eyes)
	How'd you get started?

		AUGGIE
	Taking pictures?
		(Smiles)
	It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks
	to get through that one.

		PAUL
		(Nodding)
	A photographer ...

		AUGGIE
	Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures.
	You line up what you want in the viewfinder and
	click the shutter. No need to mess around with
	all that artisto crap.

		PAUL
	I'd like to see your pictures some day.

		AUGGIE
	It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read
	your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share
	my pictures with you.
		(Pause. Suddenly embarrassed)
	It would be an honor.

10. INT: NIGHT. AUGGIE'S APARTMENT

AUGGIE and PAUL are sitting at the kitchen table, opened boxes of
Chinese food pushed to one side. Most of the surface of the table is
covered with large black photograph albums. There are fourteen in all,
and the spine of each one is labeled with a year -- ranging from 1977
to 1990. One of these albums (1987) is open on PAUL'S lap.

Close-up of one of the pages in the album. There are six
black-and-white photos on the page, each one of an identical scene: the
corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the
morning. In the upper right-hand corner of each photo, there is a small
white label bearing the date: 8-9-87, 8-10-87, 8-11-87, etc. PAUL'S
hand turns the page; we see six more similar photographs. He turns the
page again: same thing. And again: same thing.

		PAUL
		(Astonished)
	They're all the same.

		AUGGIE
		(Smiling proudly)
	That's right. More than four thousand pictures
	of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and
	Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning.
	Four thousand straight days in all kinds of
	weather.
		(Pause)
	That's why I can never take a vacation. I've
	got to be in my spot every morning. Every
	morning in the same spot at the same time.

		PAUL
		(At a loss. Turns a page,
		 then another page)
	I've never seen anything like it.

		AUGGIE
	It's my project. What you'd call my life's
	work.

		PAUL
		(Puts down the album and picks up
		 another. Flips through the pages and
		 finds more of the same. Shakes his
		 head in bafflement)
	Amazing.
		(Trying to be polite)
	I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did
	you ever come up with the idea to do this ...
	this project?

		AUGGIE
	I don't know, it just came to me. It's my
	corner, after all. It's just one little part of
	the world, but things happen there, too, just
	like everywhere else. It's a record of my
	little spot.

		PAUL
		(Flipping through the album,
		 still shaking his head)
	It's kind of overwhelming.

		AUGGIE
		(Still smiling)
	You'll never get it if you don't slow down,
	my friend.

		PAUL
	What do you mean?

		AUGGIE
	I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly
	even looking at the pictures.

		PAUL
	But they're all the same.

		AUGGIE
	They're all the same, but each one is different
	from every other one. You've got your bright
	mornings and your dark mornings. You've got
	your summer light and your autumn light. You've
	got your weekdays and your weekends. You've
	got your people in overcoats and galoshes,
	and you've got your people in shorts and
	T-shirts. Sometimes the same people,
	 sometimes different ones. And sometimes the
	different ones become the same, and the same
	ones disappear. The earth revolves around the
	sun, and every day the light from the sun hits
	the earth at a different angle.

		PAUL
		(Looks up from the album at AUGGIE)
	Slow down, huh?

		AUGGIE
	Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how
	it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time
	creeps on its petty pace.

Close-ups of the photo album. One by one, a single picture occupies the
entire screen. AUGGIE'S project unfolds before us. One picture follows
another: the same place at the same time at different moments of the
year. Close-ups of different faces within the close-ups. The same
people appear in different pictures, sometimes looking into the camera,
  sometimes looking away. Dozens of stills. Finally, we come to a
close-up of Ellen, PAUL'S dead wife.

Close-up of PAUL'S face.

		PAUL
	Jesus, look. It's Ellen.

The camera pulls away. AUGGIE leans over PAUL'S shoulder. We see PAUL'S
finger pointing to Ellen's face.

		AUGGIE
	Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from
	that year. She must have been on her way to
	work.

		PAUL
		(Moved, on the point of tears)
	It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet
	darling.

Fade out.

11.	INT: NIGHT. PAUL'S APARTMENT

We see PAUL scribbling furiously in his legal pad, lost in his work.
Behind him, we see ten or twelve index cards pinned to the wall. The
cards are covered with writing. One of them reads: "The woman with
brown hair and blue eyes." Another one reads: "The mind is led on, step
by step, to defeat its own logic." A third one reads: "Remember the
Alamo."

PAUL stands up from his desk, goes over to the wall, pulls off one of
the cards, and studies it as he returns to his desk. An instant later,
he begins writing again.

The intercom buzzer sings loudly in the other room. PAUL continues to
work, oblivious to the noise. The buzzer sounds again. PAUL puts down
his pen.

		PAUL
		(Under his breath)
	Shit.
		(He stands up from his chair, walks
		 to the other room, and presses the
		 "talk" button on the intercom)
	Who is it?

		VOICE FROM THE INTERCOM
 	Rashid.

		PAUL
	Who?

		VOICE FROM THE INTERCOM
 	Rashid Cole. The lemonade kid, remember?

		PAUL
	Yeah.
		(Without much enthusiasm)
	Come on up.
		(Pushes "door" button the intercom)

PAUL walks to the door and opens it, peering into the hall as he waits
for RASHID to arrive. A moment later, RASHID appears -- dressed as
before, the backpack slung over his shoulder. He appears awkward, ill
at ease.

		PAUL
	I didn't expect to see you again.

		RASHID
		(Making the best of it)
	Same here. But I had a long talk with my
	accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how
	a move like this would affect my tax picture,
	and he said it would be okay.

PAUL studies him with a mixture of bafflement and curiosity, but
doesn't answer. RASHID puts down his bag and begins looking around the
apartment. After a moment:

		PAUL
	That's it. Just the two rooms.

		RASHID
		(Continuing to study
		 his new surroundings)
	This is the first house I've been in without a
	TV.

		PAUL
	I used to have one, but it broke a couple of
	years ago and I never got around to replacing
	it.
		(Pause)
	I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate
	those damn things.

		RASHID
	But then you don't get to watch the ball games.
	You told me you were a Mets fan.

		PAUL
	I listen on the radio. I can see the games just
	fine that way.
		(Pause)
	The world is in your head, remember?

                        RASHID
		(Smiles. Continues to walk around. Sees
		 a small pen-and-ink drawing hanging on
		 the wall above the stereo cabinet: the
		 head of a small child. He stops to
		 examine it)
	Nice drawing. Did you do that?

		PAUL
	My father did. Believe it or not, that little
	baby is me.

		RASHID
		(Studying the drawing more carefully.
		 Turns to look at PAUL, then turns
		 back to the drawing)
	Yeah, I can believe it.

		PAUL
	It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at
	yourself before you knew who you were.

		RASHID
	Is your father an artist?

		PAUL
	No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to
	dabble.

		RASHID
	He's dead?

		PAUL
	Twelve, thirteen years ago.
		(Pause)
	Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on
	his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend,
	drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.

		RASHID
		(Studying the picture, nodding
		 his head. As if to himself)
	Drawing's a good thing.

		PAUL
 	Is that what you do? Draw pictures?

		RASHID
		(Smiles)
	Yeah, sometimes.
		(Shrugs, as if suddenly embarrassed)
	I like to dabble, too.

12.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Two hours later. We see PAUL writing at his desk in the workroom. After
a moment, he stands up and opens the double doors a crack. From PAUL'S
POV: we see RASHID sitting at the table in the main room, head resting
on his arms, asleep. The backpack is still where he put it down in the
previous scene.

13.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

8:00 in the morning. PAUL is sitting at the dining table drinking
coffee. He looks at his watch, puts down the cup, walks to the workroom
door, opens it, pokes head inside. Shot of RASHID asleep on the floor;
shot of the typewriter and legal pad on the desk. PAUL closes the door,
sighs, returns to the other room and pours himself another cup of
coffee.  Looks at his watch. Close-up of the watch: dissolve from 8:05
to 8:35. PAUL puts down the cup, stands up, walks to the workroom door,
knocks.

		PAUL
	Time to wake up.
		(Waits, listens, knocks again)
	Hey, kid, time to wake up.
		(Waits, listens, knocks again)
	Rashid!
		(Opens door. RASHID is
		 groggily opening his eyes)
	Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber
	party is over.

		RASHID
 		(Sitting up, rubbing his eyes)
	What time is it?

		PAUL
	Eight-thirty.

		RASHID
		(Appalled by early hour)
	Eight-thirty?

		PAUL
	You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the
	refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee
	on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's
	time for me to get started in here.

RASHID stands up, embarrassed. He is dressed in underpants only. He
rolls up the sleeping bag and pushes it to one side, then he gathers up
his clothes and hustles out of the room.

14.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Twenty minutes later. PAUL is sitting at his desk, staring at his
typewriter. A loud noise comes from the other room: the clatter of
dishes being put into the sink. PAUL stands up, walks to the door,
opens it. He sees RASHID, now fully dressed, picking up the telephone
next to the bed. He sees RASHID'S knapsack opened; a brown paper bag is
sitting next to it. He watches RASHID dial a number.

		RASHID
		(In a low voice)
	May I speak to Emily Vail, please? Yes, thank
	you, I'll wait.
		(Silence, three or four beats. RASHID
		 fiddles with a pillow on the bed)
	Aunt Em? Hi, it's me. I just wanted you to know
	I'm okay.
		(Pause, as he listens. The response from
		 the other end is an angry one)
	I know, I'm sorry.
		(Pause, as he listens)
	I just didn't want you to worry about me.
		(Silence, as he listens. Begins to show
		 irritation with Aunt Em's hostility)
	Just cool it, okay? Take it easy.
		(Click on the other end. He stares at the
		  receiver for a moment, then hangs up)

PAUL closes the door quietly. RASHID does not know he has been
observed. Cut back to PAUL in workroom. He sits down at his desk,
thinks for a moment, then begins typing.

15.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Several hours later. With the sounds of PAUL'S typing continuing to
come from the workroom, we see RASHID stand on a chair next to the
bookcase in the larger room and deposit the brown paper bag behind the
books on one of the upper shelves.

16.	INT: NIGHT. PAUL'S APARTMENT

A shot of RASHID asleep in PAUL'S bed. Lying next to him on the bed is
an open, half-read copy of one of PAUL'S books: The Mysterious
Barricades by Paul Benjamin.

Cut to a shot of PAUL sleeping on the floor of the workroom.

17.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

PAUL is in his workroom, sitting at his desk, typing. We see more index
cards pinned to the wall. PAUL hears a loud crash from the other room.
He pops up from his desk, exasperated, then walks to the door and opens
it. Shot of the other room: RASHID is standing there, looking down at
broken dishes.

		PAUL
		(Irritated)
	Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you
	see I'm trying to work?

		RASHID
		(Mortified)
	I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out
	of my hands.

		PAUL
	A little less clumsiness around here would be
	nice, don't you think?

		RASHID
		(Growing defensive)
	I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's
	because we're still growing. We don't know
	where our bodies end and the world begins.

		PAUL
	The world is going to end pretty soon if you
	don't learn fast.
		(Pause. PAUL reaches into his pocket and
		 pulls out his wallet, then removes a
		 twenty-dollar bill)
	Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just
	about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to
	the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins
	of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
		(Hands the bill to RASHID)

		RASHID
		(Taking the bill)
	Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure
	you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you
	afraid I might steal it?

		PAUL
	If you want to steal it, that's your business.
	At least I won't have you around here making
	noise.
		(Pause)
	It might be worth it.

RASHID, visibly hurt by PAUL'S remark, puts the money in his pocket.
For once, he is unable to come up with a quick retort.

RASHID walks out of the apartment. PAUL watches the door slam. Slight
pause, then he bends down and starts picking up the broken dishes.

18.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

The workroom. A few minutes later. PAUL returns to his desk and begins
to type. Almost immediately, the ribbon jams. He lets out a groan, then
opens the typewriter to inspect the damage.

19.	EXT: DAY. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO., AS SEEN FROM ACROSS THE STREET

Eight o'clock in the morning. We see AUGGIE on the corner, getting
ready to take his daily photograph. Cut to the corner as seen through
the lens of the camera. Hustle and bustle, people on their way to work.
Automobile traffic, buses, delivery trucks. We hear the shutter click.
The picture freezes.

20.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

The workroom. PAUL is sitting at his desk, writing. A loud crash from
the other room punctuates the silence. He jumps in his chair.

		PAUL
		(Groans)
	Shit.

He stands up, goes to the door, opens it. Shot of RASHID standing
precariously on the arm of a chair, his right hand groping behind the
books on the top shelf of the bookcase. Several books have already
fallen to the floor.

		PAUL (cont'd)
	Jesus Christ. Are you at it again?

RASHID turns at the sound of PAUL'S voice, momentarily losing his
balance. As he grabs hold of the bookcase again to steady himself, more
books fall off the shelf and come tumbling to the floor. An instant
later, he lands on the floor as well.

		PAUL (cont'd)
	What is it with you, anyway? You're like a
	human wrecking ball.

		RASHID
		(Climbing to his feet. Ashamed)
	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to
	reach for one of the books up there ...
		(Points)
	And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of
	me.

 		PAUL
		(With growing irritation)
	It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half
	years without being able to write a word, and
	then, when I finally get started on something,
	when it looks as though I might actually be
	coming to life again, you show up and start
	breaking everything in my house. It just won't
	do, will it?

		RASHID
		(Hurt, subdued)
	I didn't ask to come here. You invited me,
	remember?
		(Pause)
	If you want me to leave, all you have to do is
	say so.

 		PAUL
	How long have you been here?

		RASHID
	Three nights.

 		PAUL
	And how long did I tell you you could stay?

		RASHID
	Two or three nights.

		PAUL
	It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?

                        RASHID
		(Looking down at floor)
	I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to
	me ...
		(Walks toward the bed, picks up the
		 backpack from the floor, and begins
		 stuffing his things into it)
	But all good things have to come to an end,
	right?

		PAUL
	No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place,
	and I can't get my work done with you around.

		RASHID
	You don't have to apologize.
		(Pause)
	The coast is probably clear now anyway.

		PAUL
		(Softening)
	Are you going to be all right?

		RASHID
	Absolutely. The world is my oyster.
		(Pause)
	Whatever that means.
		(He looks up at the bookshelf, studying
		 the spot where the bag is hidden. He
		 makes a quick, resolute decision to
		 leave the bag where it is)

		PAUL
	Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?

		RASHID
	Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
		(Hoists the backpack over his shoulder,
		 begins walking toward the door)

		PAUL
		(a little stunned by
		 RASHID'S decisiveness)
	Take good care of yourself, okay?

		RASHID
	You too. And make sure the light is green
	before you cross the street.
		(Reaches for the doorknob, opens
		 the door, hesitates, turns around)
	Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think
	you're a hell of a good writer.
		(Without waiting for a response, he
		 opens the door again and leaves)

Shot of PAUL standing alone in the middle of the room. He walks to the
window and looks outside. Shot of the street below. After three or four
seconds, RASHID emerges from the building. Without glancing back, he
begins walking down the street.

Cut to PAUL standing at the window. He lights up a cigar. Cut back to
the street. RASHID has disappeared. An instant later, a blind man
comes walking around the corner, tapping his white cane on the
sidewalk.

21.	INT: NIGHT. AUGGIE'S APARTMENT

The windows are open and traffic noises can be heard from the street
below.

AUGGIE alone. Jazz is playing on his tape machine. He takes a TV dinner
out of the oven, then sits down at the kitchen table and begins to eat.
Fade out.

Fade in. The meal is over. AUGGIE pours himself a shot of bourbon. He
drinks it down in one swallow and smacks his lips, exhaling loudly.
Stares blankly ahead of him for a moment. Then he reaches for a
paperback copy of Crime and Punishment open on the table. As he finds
his place in the book, he lights a cigarette. After one or two puffs,
he begins to cough: a deep, rattling, prolonged smoker's cough. He
pounds his chest. It doesn't help. He stands up, banging the table as
the coughing fit continues. He begins to stagger around the kitchen,
cursing between breaths. In his rage, he sweeps everything off the
table: glass, bottle, book, remnants of the TV dinner. The cough
subsides, then starts up again. He grabs hold of the kitchen sink and
spits into the basin.

22.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

The main room. We hear the sound of PAUL typing. A loud, insistent
banging is heard at the front door. Cut to PAUL opening the door.
RASHID'S AUNT EM is standing in the hall. She is a black woman of about
forty, dressed in clothes that suggest she works in an office.

		AUNT EM
		(Angrily)
	Is your name Paul Benjamin?

		PAUL
		(Taken aback)
	What can I do for you?

		AUNT EM
		(Barging into the apartment)
	I just want to know what your game is, mister,
	that's all.

		PAUL
		(Horrified. Watching her as she
		 charges around the room)
	How the hell did you get into the building?

		AUNT EM
	What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the
	door and walked in. What do you think?

		PAUL
		(Muttering to himself)
	The damn lock's broken again.
		(Pause, as he returns
		 AUNT EM'S glare. Louder)
	And so you just barge in on strangers, is that
	what you do? Is that your game?

		AUNT EM
	I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.

		PAUL
	Thomas? Who's Thomas?

		AUNT EM
	Don't give me any of that. I know he's been
	here. You can't fool me, mister.

		PAUL
	I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named
	Thomas.

		AUNT EM
	Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.

		PAUL
	You mean Rashid?

		AUNT EM
	Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his
	name was?

		PAUL
	Well, whatever his name is, he's not here
	anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't
	heard from him since.

		AUNT EM
	And what was he doing here in the first place?
	That's what I want to know. What's a man like
	you messing around with a black boy like
	Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or
	what?

                       PAUL
		(Losing patience)
	Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm
	down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear
	me? Right now!

		AUNT EM
		(Getting a grip on herself)
	I just want to know where he is.

		PAUL
	As far as I know, he went back to his parents.

		AUNT EM
		(Incredulous)
	His parents? Is that what he told you? His
	parents?

		PAUL
	That's what he said. He told me he lived with
	his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth
	Street.

		AUNT EM
		(Defeated, shaking her head)
	I always knew that boy had an imagination, but
	now he's gone and made up a whole new life for
	himself.
		(Pause)
	Do you mind if I sit down?
		(PAUL gestures to a
		 chair; she sits down)
	He's been living with me and his uncle Henry
	since he was a baby. And we don't live in
	Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the
	projects.

		PAUL
 	He doesn't go to the Trinity School?

		AUNT EM
	He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.

		PAUL
		(Beginning to show concern)
	And his parents?

		AUNT EM
	His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his
	father in twelve years.

		PAUL
		(Softly, almost to himself)
	I shouldn't have let him go.

		AUNT EM
		(Studying PAUL)
	Which brings me back to my original question.
	What was he doing here in the first place?

		PAUL
	I was about to get run over by a car, and your
	nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.
		(Pause)
	I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put
	him up for a few days. Maybe I should have
	pressed him a little more, I don't know. I
	feel pretty stupid about it now.

		AUNT EM
	He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have
	any idea what it is.

		PAUL
		(Sits down in a chair, lets out a sigh,
		 thinks for a moment. Turns to AUNT EM)
	Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass
	of water?

		AUNT EM
		(Primly)
	No thank you.

                       PAUL
		(Lapses into thought again.
		 After a moment)
	Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual
	or unexpected?

		AUNT EM
		(Thinks)
	Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it
	has anything to do with this.
		(Pause)
	A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and
	said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at
	some gas station outside of Peekskill.

		PAUL
	And you told your nephew about it?

		AUNT EM
		(Shrugs)
	I figured he had a right to know.

		PAUL
	And?

		AUNT EM
	And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in
	the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As
	far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is
	dead."

		PAUL
	Those are pretty hostile words.

The camera slowly closes in on her face as she speaks:

		AUNT EM
	His father walked out on his mother a couple of
	months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's
	younger sister, and she and the baby moved in
	with us. Four or five years go by, and then one
	day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail
	between his legs, wanting to patch things up
	with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear
	Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the
	door. They're both big men, those two, and if
	they ever started to tangle, you'd see some
	teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ...
	So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to
	talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl
	never came back.

		PAUL (OFF)
	You mean she just ran off with him and left her
	little boy behind?

		AUNT EM
	Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is
	she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the
	Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm
	saying is that he imbibed too much in the way
	of alcohol and that when they finished their
	little talk three hours later and got back in
	the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he
	drove the car anyway, and before he could get
	her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran
	a red light and went straight into a truck.
	Louisa got thrown through the windshield and
	was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it
	a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the
	doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for
	what he did, if you ask me.

		PAUL (OFF)
		(Aghast)
	Jesus.

		AUNT EM
	Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been
	involved. He would have seen to it that things
	worked out the opposite from what they did.

		PAUL (OFF)
	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around
	with that on his conscience all these years.

		AUNT EM
	No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up
	like nobody's business in that hospital when he
	found out Louisa was dead.

		PAUL (OFF)
	And he's never tried to get in touch with his
	son?

		AUNT EM
	Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever
	showed his face around our house again. When
	Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to
	take him seriously.

PAUL and AUNT EM look at each other. Cut to shot of the kitchen sink.
Water is slowly dripping from the faucet. Hold for two or three beats.

23.	EXT: DAY. A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF PEEKSKILL

Early morning. Trees, shrubs, twittering birds. We see RASHID trudging
down the road. Dissolve to:

The same road, a mile on. RASHID looks up. Cut to:

24. 	EXT: DAY. COLE'S GARAGE

The garage is a ramshackle, two-story building. Over the main door is a
clumsily executed hand-painted sign that reads: COLE'S GARAGE. Two
Chevron gas pumps stand alone in the front: weeds sprout through the
macadam. To one side of the station is a grassy area with a
weather-beaten picnic table.

The double garage doors are open. We see a man in there working on the
engine of an old Chevrolet. The hood is up, which obscures the man's
 face, but we can see that he is wearing mechanic's overalls and that
the color of his skin is black.

He is a large, burly man of about forty. Once he appears from behind
the hood, we see that his left hand is missing. A metal hook juts out
of his sleeve.

This is RASHID'S father, CYRUS COLE.

25. 	EXT: DAY. THE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY ROAD, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE COLE'S GARAGE

We see RASHID sitting on the hood of a rusted car across the road from
the garage. He is motionless, hugging his knees and gazing intently in
the direction of the camera. Hold for three, four beats.

26. 	INT: DAY. COLE'S GARAGE

A bit later. CYRUS, still busily at work on the Chevrolet, glances up
and sees RASHID across the road. He studies him for a moment, then
returns to his work.

27.	EXT: DAY. THE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY ROAD, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE COLE'S GARAGE

An hour later. We see RASHID sitting on the hood of the car, as before.
This time he has his sketch pad propped against his knees and is doing
a pencil drawing of the garage across the way.

28. 	EXT: DAY. OUTSIDE COLE'S GARAGE

An hour later. We see CYRUS emerge from the garage carrying a brown
paper bag. He walks over to the picnic table, sits down, and takes out
his lunch from the bag: a ham sandwich, an apple, a can of iced tea. As
he chews and drinks, he studies RASHID across the road. Every now and
then, a car or truck passes by.

The camera cuts between RASHID and CYRUS. RASHID, working busily on his
 drawing, pretends not to notice he is being watched.

At last, CYRUS finishes his lunch. He crumples up the paper bag, gets
to his feet, and tosses his garbage into a rusted metal trash can next
to the picnic table. Instead of going back to work, he crosses the
road.

29.	EXT: DAY. THE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY ROAD, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE COLE'S GARAGE

Master shot. As CYRUS approaches, RASHID looks up, meeting the man's
eyes for the first time. Before CYRUS can get close enough to see the
drawing, RASHID closes the sketch pad and presses it against his chest.
He makes no attempt to stand up.

		CYRUS
	You going to sit here all day?

		RASHID
 	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

		CYRUS
	Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a
	man the creeps to be stared at all morning.

		RASHID
	It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm
	not trespassing on your property. I can stay
	here till kingdom come.

		CYRUS
		(Approaching the car. RASHID jumps
		 off the hood as CYRUS draws closer)
	Let me give you some useful information, son.
	There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in
	that cash register over there
		(gestures with his hand to the
		 garage across the road)
 	and considering all the time you've put in
	casing the joint so far, you won't make but
	about fifty cents an hour for all your pains.
	However you slice it, that's a losing
	proposition.

		RASHID
	I'm not going to rob you, mister.
		(Amused)
	Do I look like a thief?

		CYRUS
	I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as
	I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in
	this spot last night.
		(Pause. Studies RASHID more closely)
	You live in this town -- or on your way from
	here to there?

		RASHID
	Just passing through.

		CYRUS
	Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with
	a knapsack on his back plops himself across
	from my garage to admire the view. There's
	other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm
	saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of
	yourself.

		RASHID
	I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of
	yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.

		CYRUS
	It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture
	won't improve the way it looks.
		(Zeroing in on the sketch pad
		 pressed against RASHID'S chest)
	Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.

		RASHID
		(Thinking fast)
	It'll cost you five bucks.

		CYRUS
	Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me
	five bucks just to look at it?

		RASHID
	Once you look at it, you're going to want to
	buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's
	the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing
	to spring for it, you might as well not bother
	to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make
	you miserable.

		CYRUS
		(Shaking his head)
	Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work,
	aren't you?

		RASHID
		(Shrugs)
	I just tell it like it is, mister.
		(Pause)
	If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you
	might want to think about hiring me.

		CYRUS
		(Growing annoyed)
	Do you have eyes in your head, or are those
	brown things bulging out of your sockets just
	marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and
	how many cars have you seen drive up and ask
	for gas?

		RASHID
	Not a one.

		CYRUS
	Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought
	this broken-down shit-hole of a place three
	weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon,
	I'm going straight down the skids. What do I
	want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay
	my own wages.

		RASHID
 	It was just a thought.

		CYRUS
	Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else,
	Michelangelo. I got work to do.

CYRUS begins to leave. We see him crossing the road, shaking his head.
Halfway there, he suddenly stops, turns, and shouts at RASHID:

		CYRUS (cont'd)
	Who do you think I am, the fucking State
	Employment Agency?

30.	EXT: DAY. THE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY ROAD, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE COLE'S GARAGE

Half an hour later. We see RASHID sitting on the hood of the car, as
before. This time he is eating a sandwich, chewing slowly as he gazes
ahead.

31. 	EXT: DAY. COLE'S GARAGE

We see CYRUS at work on the Chevrolet. Every now and then, he glances
up to look at RASHID.

CYRUS finishes the job he has been doing. He slams the hood of the
Chevrolet shut. Quick cut to:

32.	EXT: DAY. THE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY ROAD, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE COLE'S GARAGE

CYRUS enters the frame and hoists himself onto the hood of the car --
right next to RASHID. A long silence.

		CYRUS
		(Trying to be friendly)
	I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give
	you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that
	upstairs room over there
		(Turns, points)
	-- the one above the office -- is a hell of a
	mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk
	in there for twenty years, and it's time it got
	cleaned up.

		RASHID
		(Playing it cool)
	What's your offer?

		CYRUS
	Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate,
	isn't it?
		(Looks at his wristwatch)
	It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking
	me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about
	three hours. If you can't finish today, you can
	do the rest tomorrow.

		RASHID
		(Getting to his feet)
	Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring
	me on a freelance basis?

		CYRUS
	Benefits?

		RASHID
	You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid
	vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers
	have to stand up for their rights.

		CYRUS
	I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly
	freelance basis.

		RASHID
		(Long pause, pretending
		 to think it over)
	Five dollars an hour?
		(Another pause)
	I'll take it.

		CYRUS
		(Cracking a faint smile.
		 Extends his right hand)
	The name is Cyrus Cole.

		RASHID
	Paul. Paul Benjamin.

They shake hands.

33. 	INT: DAY. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

It is a slow hour in the middle of the afternoon. AUGGIE is sitting on
a stool behind the counter, reading his paperback copy of Dostoyevsky's
 Crime and Punishment. JIMMY ROSE is working in silence near the far
wall on the other side of the counter, diligently and awkwardly
straightening the stacks of newspapers and magazines.

The bell on the front door rattles, signaling the arrival of a
customer. Shot of JIMMY stopping his work to look up in the direction
of the door. From JIMMY'S POV: a woman enters the store. She is RUBY
McNUTT (AUGGIE'S old flame). Mid-forties, wearing a sleeveless summer
dress, her face registering a tumult of anxiety, determination, and
self-consciousness. She wears a black patch over her left eye.

Shot of JIMMY looking in wonder at the patch. Shot of RUBY looking in
the direction of the counter. Shot of AUGGIE sitting behind the
counter, still immersed in his book, not bothering to glance up.
Close-up of RUBY'S face: she is looking at AUGGIE. Her lips are
trembling. She is obviously moved, but she is too afraid to speak. With
the camera fixed on RUBY'S face, we hear:

		JIMMY (OFF)
		(Hesitantly)
	Auggie.
		(No response. Pause)
	Auggie, I think there's a customer.

Close-up of AUGGIE glancing up from his book. We see his expression
change from one of indifference to recognition and astonishment.

Close-up of RUBY looking at him. She smiles tentatively. As they talk,
JIMMY studies them with rapt attention.

		RUBY
	Auggie?

Shot of AUGGIE'S face: he is still too amazed to speak.

 		RUBY (cont'd)
	It's really you, Auggie, isn't it?

		AUGGIE
		(Finally)
	Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you
	were dead.

 		RUBY
	Eighteen and a half years.

		 	AUGGIE
	Is that all? I thought it was about three
	hundred.

		RUBY
		(Shyly, hesitantly)
	You're looking good, Auggie.

                      AUGGIE
	No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you,
	Ruby. You look just awful.
		(Pause, with increasing bitterness)
	What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do
	with that old blue marble -- hock it for a
	bottle of gin?

		RUBY
		(Hurt, embarrassed)
	I don't want to talk about it.
		(Pause)
	If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm
	not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie,
	and it never gave me nothing but grief.

                      AUGGIE
	And you think it looks better to go around
	dressed up like Captain Hook?

		RUBY
		(In a low voice, trying to maintain
		 her composure and dignity)
	You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you?
	A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.

		AUGGIE
	At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is
	more than I can say about some people.

		RUBY
		(Again, she tries to shrug it
		 off. Takes a deep breath)
	I've got something to talk to you about, and
	the least you can do is listen. You owe me that
	much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to
	see you, and I'm not going until you've heard
	me out.

		AUGGIE
	Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.

		RUBY
		(Glancing around the store.
		 Sees JIMMY studying her)
	This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.

		AUGGIE
		(Addressing JIMMY with
		 unaccustomed irritation)
	You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have
	private business to discuss. Go outside and
	stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to
	come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?

		JIMMY
	Sure, Auggie, I got it.
		(Pause)
	The store's closed.
		(Pause, thinks)
	And when do I tell them it's open?

		AUGGIE
		(Snaps)
	When I tell you it's open. It's open when I
	tell you it's open!

		JIMMY
		(Hurt)
	Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.

JIMMY goes outside and posts himself in front of the door.

		AUGGIE
		(Looking closely at RUBY as
		 he lights a cigarette)
	All right, sugar, what's on your mind?

		RUBY
		(Pause. Self-conscious)
	Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me
	the creeps.

		AUGGIE
	Like what?

		RUBY
	Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat
	you up.
		(Pause)
	I need your help, and if you keep staring at me
	like that. I might start screaming.

		AUGGIE
		(With an edge of sarcasm)
	Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has
	anything to do with money, does it?

		RUBY
	Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to
	conclusions before I've even said anything.
		(Pause)
	And besides, it's not for me.
		(Pause. Realizing she's let the cat
		 out of the bag. In desperation, she
		 plunges on)
	It's for our daughter.

		AUGGIE
		(Shocked, growing belligerent)
	Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our
	daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter,
	but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did --
	which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.

		RUBY
	Her name is Felicity, and she just turned
	eighteen.
		(Pause)
	She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now
	she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn
	with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack,
	four months pregnant.
		(Pause)
	I can't bear to think about that baby. Our
	grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our
	grandchild.

		AUGGIE
		(Waving her off, impatient)
	Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right
	now.
		(Pause. Changing the
		 subject. With contempt)
	Was that your idea to call her Felicity?

		RUBY
	It means "happiness."

		AUGGIE
	I know what it means. That still don't make it
	a good name.

		RUBY
	I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.

		AUGGIE
	You've suckered me before, darling, remember?
	Why should I believe you now?

		RUBY
	Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it
	was easy to come here and walk into this place?
	Why would I do it if I didn't have to?

		AUGGIE
	That's what you told me when I shoplifted that
	necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't
	you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to
	the can or enlist. So, instead of going to
	college, I wind up in the navy for four years,
	I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly
	get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby
	McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole,
	Bill.

		RUBY
	You didn't write to me for more than a year.
	What was I supposed to think?

		AUGGIE
	Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a
	new one, I was clean out of paper.

		RUBY
	It was over with Bill before you ever came
	home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you
	were pretty hot to see me back then.

		AUGGIE
	You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at
	first.

		RUBY
	It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But
	we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.

		AUGGIE
	A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A
	second or two snatched from the jaws of
	eternity.

		RUBY
	And that's how Felicity came into the picture.
	During one of those two seconds.

		AUGGIE
	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't
	responsible for no baby.

		RUBY
	Then why do you think I married Frank? I was
	already pregnant, and I didn't have much time.
	Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid
	a name.

		AUGGIE
	Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey
	these days?

		RUBY
	Who the hell knows?
		(Shrugs)
	He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.

		AUGGIE
	Fifteen years ago?
		(Shakes head)
	It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen
	years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't
	born yesterday, you know.

		RUBY
		(Her lips start to tremble. We see
		tears falling from her one good eye)
	I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to
	bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own,
	but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.

		AUGGIE
	Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out.
	You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare
	cash is tied up in a business venture, and I
	haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You
	caught me at the wrong time.

		RUBY
		(Still crying)
	You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you?
	How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?

		AUGGIE
	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not.
	Every word I told you is the God's honest
	truth.

Pause. Then cut to the store entrance. The door suddenly bursts open as
an IRATE CUSTOMER pushes his way past JIMMY. We see JIMMY futilely
trying to hold him back.

		AUGGIE (cont'd)
		(Shouting at customer. Beside himself)
	The store's closed! Didn't you hear what the
	kid told you? The goddamn store is closed!

34.	INT: DAY. THE UPSTAIRS ROOM OF COLE'S GARAGE

We see RASHID working diligently. The place is a pigsty, cluttered with
all sorts of debris: rusty bicycles, rags, automotive parts, a female
mannequin, broken radios, shower curtains, etc. One by one, RASHID
drags or carries these things toward the door. At one point, he finds a
small, portable black-and-white TV hidden under a rug. The rabbit ears
are broken, the casing is covered with dust, but other than that it
seems to be in reasonably good shape.

35. 	EXT: DAY. OUTSIDE COLE'S GARAGE

RASHID and CYRUS are carrying the debris from the upstairs room and
throwing it into the back of an old red pickup truck. Once they get rid
of a load, they go back inside for more. Since RASHID is faster, they
are working out of phase: when one is outside, the other is inside.

They work in silence. CYRUS begins to huff and puff from going up and
down the stairs. Eventually, after a number of trips, he drops a load
into the truck and stops. He leans against the truck, pulls out a
large, cheap half-smoked cigar from his shirt pocket, and lights up.
Close-up of the hook as he strikes the match. After one or two puffs on
the cigar, RASHID appears with another load and tosses it into the
truck.

 		CYRUS
	Time for a pause.

Without further ado, RASHID promptly sits down on the rear bumper of
the truck. He does it so quickly, the effect is comical. He watches
CYRUS smoke. Two or three beats.

		RASHID
	I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering
	what happened to your arm.

		CYRUS
		(Holds up his hook and
		 studies it for a moment)
	An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?
		(Pause)
	I'll tell you what happened to my arm.
		(Pause. Remembering)
	I'll tell you what happened.
		(Pause)
	Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and
	said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man.
	First of all, I'm going to fill your body with
	spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind
	the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make
	you crash that car and kill the woman who loves
	you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live,
	because living is a lot worse than death. And
	just so you don't forget what you did to that
	poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and
	replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could
	rip off both your arms and both your legs, but
	I'm going to be merciful and just take off your
	left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I
	want you to remember what a bad, stupid,
	selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to
	you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."

		RASHID
		(Impressed by the sincerity
		 of CYRUS'S speech)
	And have you mended them?

		CYRUS
	I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying,
	but it's no easy task for a man to change his
	nature.
		(Pause)
	I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop
	in six years. And now I've got me a wife.
	Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.
		(Pause)
	And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.
		(Pause)
	So things have definitely improved since I got
	fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this
	goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good
	shape.

		RASHID
	You named the kid after yourself, huh?

		CYRUS
		(Smiling at the thought of his son)
	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

Cut to close-up of RASHID'S face. He seems to be growing more and more
upset.

		CYRUS (cont'd)
	And what about you, kid? What's your story?

		RASHID
		(Turning away)
	Who, me? I don't have a story. I'm just a kid.

Fade out.

36.	EXT: DAY. OUTSIDE COLE'S GARAGE

Late afternoon. RASHID and CYRUS continue loading debris into the back
of the truck. We see the black-and-white portable TV sitting on the
ground outside the office.

After a few moments, a ten-year-old blue Ford pulls up next to the
truck and stops. It is driven by CYRUS'S wife, DOREEN. She is an
attractive, self-possessed woman in her late twenties. CYRUS JUNIOR is
sitting in a child-restraint seat in the back. He is two years old.

CYRUS'S face lights up when he sees the car. DOREEN cuts off the engine
and gets out, smiling at her husband. RASHID, suddenly forgotten by
CYRUS, watches the exchange with keen interest.

		CYRUS
	Hi, baby. How'd it go today?

		DOREEN
		(Joking)
	If I have to wash one more old lady's hair, I
	think my fingers would fall off.
		(She kisses him on the cheek)

		CYRUS
	Busy, huh? That's good, because things around
	here sure were sleepy today.

		DOREEN
		(Opening the back of the car,
		 unstrapping JUNIOR from his seat, and
		 picking him up in her arms)
	Don't worry, Cy. It's early days yet.
		(Addressing JUNIOR, but at the same
		 time catching sight of RASHID)
	Say hello to Daddy.

		JUNIOR
		(In his mother's arms, excited
		 at seeing his father)
	Dada! Dada!

		CYRUS
		(Taking the boy in his arms
		 and giving him a big kiss)
	Hey there, little tiger. And what did you do
	today?

		DOREEN
		(Addressing RASHID as she
		 hands the baby to CYRUS)
	Hello.

 		RASHID
		(Shyly)
	Hello.

                       CYRUS
		(Noticing the exchange
		 between DOREEN and RASHID)
	Jesus, I almost forgot you were here. Doreen,
	this is Paul. My new assistant.

DOREEN extends her right hand to RASHID.

		RASHID
		(Shaking DOREEN'S hand)
	It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.

		CYRUS
		(Turning JUNIOR toward RASHID)
	And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is
	Junior.

		RASHID
		(Studying JUNIOR carefully. Mumbles
		 in a barely audible voice)
	Hi there, little brother.

		CYRUS
	(To JUNIOR) Say hi to Paul.

		JUNIOR
	Hi there, little brother.

		CYRUS
		(To DOREEN)
	He's helping me clean out that upstairs room.
	Might as well get this place looking good,
	anyway.
		(To RASHID)
	I guess that's it for today, sport. Come back
	tomorrow morning at eight, and you can pick up
	where you left off.
		(Starts walking to the office
		 with JUNIOR in his arms)

We see him through the window: opening the cash register, pocketing the
money, turning out the lights, then coming out and closing the garage
doors. In the foreground, we see RASHID standing with DOREEN. He looks
down at the ground, too shy to say a word to her. She studies him with
a mixture of curiosity and amusement. When CYRUS is finished closing
up, he walks toward them and says to RASHID:

		CYRUS (cont'd)
	Do you want me to pay you now, or can you wait
	until tomorrow?

		RASHID
	Tomorrow's fine. There's no rush.

37.	EXT: EARLY EVENING. OUTSIDE COLE'S GARAGE

A little later. We see RASHID sitting next to the TV outside the office
door. He is utterly still. Hold for two, three beats.

38.	INT: EARLY EVENING. INSIDE THE OFFICE OF COLE'S GARAGE

We see a pencil drawing being slid under the door. It is an excellent
rendering of the garage as seen from across the road.

The camera moves in on the drawing until it occupies the entire screen.
Hold for two, three beats.

39.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

PAUL opens the door. RASHID is standing in the hall, holding the
black-and-white TV in his arms. The knapsack is on his back. His
clothes have become a little shabbier since the last time we saw him.

		PAUL
		(Surprised)
	Hey, it's you.

		RASHID
		(Serious)
	I wanted to give you this as a token of my
	appreciation.

		PAUL
	Appreciation for what?

		RASHID
	I don't know. For helping me out.

		PAUL
		(Eyeing TV suspiciously)
	Where did you get that thing?

		RASHID
	I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at
	Goldbaum's TV and Radio.
 		(Hands TV to PAUL, who takes it
		 in his arms. RASHID smiles)
	Well, that just about takes care of it, I
	guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games.
	You know, as a little break from your work.
		(Begins to leave)

		PAUL
	Where the hell do you think you're going?

		RASHID
	Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at
	three o'clock.

		PAUL
	Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come
	back here.

		RASHID
		(Looking at his watch. Shrugs)
	I don't have much time.
		(Returns to the doorway,
		 enters the apartment)

		PAUL
		(Puts TV on the stereo cabinet)
	Close the door.
		(RASHID closes the door)
	Sit down in that chair.
		(Points. RASHID sits down in the chair)
	Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a
	couple of days ago. She was sick with worry,
	out of her mind. We had an interesting talk
	about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm
	saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and
	so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear
	all about it right now.

		RASHID
		(Realizes he is trapped. Shrugs. Smiles
		 weakly. Looks down at floor to avoid
		 PAUL'S gaze. When he dares to look up
		 again, PAUL is still glowering at him.)
 	You don't really want to know.

		PAUL
		(Impatient)
	I don't, huh? And what makes you such an
	authority on what I want or don't want?

		RASHID
		(Sighs, defeated)
	Okay, okay.
		(Pause)
	It's all so stupid.
		(Pause)
	There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The
	Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind
	of guy you don't want to cross paths with.

		PAUL
	And?

		RASHID
	I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying
	to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure
	I don't run into him again.

		PAUL
	So that's the something you weren't supposed to
	see, huh?

Close-up of RASHID, becoming more animated as he talks.

		RASHID
	I just happened to be walking by... All of a
	sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come
	running out of this check-cashing place with
	masks on their faces and guns in their hands...
	They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper
	recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized
	him... If the guy from the check-cashing place
	hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder,
	he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the
	Creeper would have shot me right there on the
	sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and
	when he turned around to see what was
	happening, I took off... One more second, and I
	would have been dead.

		PAUL
	Why don't you go to the police?

		RASHID
	You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way
	of trying to be funny, right?

		PAUL
	If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be
	safe.

		RASHID
	The man has friends. And they're not likely to
	forgive me if I testify against him.

		PAUL
		(Thinking)
	What makes you think you'll be any safer around
	here? It's only about a mile away from where
	you live.

		RASHID
	It might not be far, but it's another galaxy.
	Black is black and white is white, and never
	the twain shall meet.

		PAUL
	It looks like they've met in this apartment.

		RASHID
	That's because we don't belong anywhere. You
	don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into
	mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.

		PAUL
		(Studying RASHID)
	Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't
	belong.

		RASHID
	Let's not get too idealistic.

		PAUL
		(Pause. Breaks into a smile)
	Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried
	away, would we?
		(Pause)
	Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're
	alive.

40.	INT: EVENING. PAUL'S APARTMENT

PAUL and RASHID are watching the Mets on television. They are both
smoking little cigars. PAUL puffs on his calmly; RASHID coughs after
each puff of his. He is clearly not used to smoking. The television
has a defective tube, the reception is poor, and every now and then one
of them stands up and bangs the top of the set to bring the picture
back into focus. They watch the ball game in silence. Close-up of the
TV screen: the batter swings. An announcer's voice is heard describing
the action.

41.	EXT: LATE AFTERNOON. THE CORNER IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

AUGGIE is alone, closing up shop, looking particularly scruffy and
unshaven. Just as he finishes pulling down the last metal gate, a car
 with Pennsylvania license plates comes speeding down Seventh Avenue and
brakes to a sudden stop in front of the store. It is a ten-year-old
Pontiac in rather sorry shape: belching smoke, with a defective muffler
and a dented body. AUGGIE, distracted by the commotion, turns and looks
at the car.

From AUGGIE'S POV: we look into the car and see that the driver is RUBY
McNUTT.  She leans out the open window and addresses AUGGIE in an
urgent voice.

		RUBY
	Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.

		AUGGIE
		(Reluctant)
	You don't give up, do you?

		RUBY
	Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to
	do anything. I just need you to come with me.

		AUGGIE
	Where to?

		RUBY
		(Impatient)
	Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions.
	Just get in the car.

AUGGIE shrugs. RUBY opens the right front door of the car, and he
climbs in. They drive off.

42.	EXT: EVENING. THE STREETS OF BROOKLYN

We see RUBY'S car as it travels through the Brooklyn evening, making
its way down Seventh Avenue to Flatbush Avenue, then turning onto
Eastern Parkway and gliding past the Public Library and the Brooklyn
Museum as it penetrates the slums of Crown Heights and East New York.

		RUBY
	I told her she was going to meet her father.

		AUGGIE
	You what?

		RUBY
	It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she
	wasn't going to let me see her.

		AUGGIE
	I think you'd better stop the car and let me
	out.

		RUBY
	Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything.
	Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you
	to do a little favor like that. Besides, you
	might even learn something.

		 AUGGIE
	Yeah, like what?

		RUBY
	That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At
	least you'll know I've been telling the truth.

		AUGGIE
	Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter.
	It's just that she's not my daughter.

		RUBY
	Wait till you see her, Auggie.

		AUGGIE
	And what's that supposed to mean?

		RUBY
	She looks just like you.

		AUGGIE
		(Irritated)
	Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's
	starting to get on my nerves.

		RUBY
	When I told her I was going to bring her father,
	she kind of melted. It's the first time
	Felicity's talked nice to me since she left
	home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.

They drive on in silence for a few more seconds. By now they have
 entered one of the worst, most dangerous parts of the city. We see
broken-down, boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with rubble,
trash scattered on the sidewalks. RUBY turns down one of these streets,
then brings the car to a halt in front of a walk-up building with
spray-painted graffiti on the outer door: KILL THE COPS. AUGGIE and
RUBY get out of the car and start walking toward the building. Down the
street, in the distance, we see a black man pick up a metal garbage can
and throw it violently to the ground. It lands with a loud crash.

		AUGGIE
	Nice neighborhood you've brought me to. Full of
	happy, prosperous people.

43.	INT: EVENING. FELICITY'S APARTMENT

Close-up of a scarred green door. A knocking is heard from the other
side. Pause. The knocking is heard again. After another pause, we hear
feet padding toward the door. A second later a shoulder enters the
frame. This is FELICITY from behind. She is dressed in a cheap flowered
robe.

		FELICITY
	Yeah? Who is it?

		RUBY (OFF)
	It's me, honey. It's Mom.

We see FELICITY'S hand reach out and unbolt the lock. The door opens to
reveal AUGGIE and RUBY standing in the hall. They both look nervous:
RUBY expectant and hopeful, with a forced smile on her face, AUGGIE
guarded and closed in on himself. Cut to a close-up of FELICITY'S face.
She is a very pretty blonde of eighteen. Her expression is hostile,
however, and there is a wasted look in her eyes. We see clumsily
applied rouge on her cheeks, a slash of red lipstick on her lips. She
runs her hand through her stringy, unwashed hair. Cut to a close-up of
AUGGIE'S face. It is impossible to know what he is thinking.

As AUGGIE and RUBY enter the apartment, the camera backs up to show the
room. It is a tawdry place with little furniture: a double mattress on
the floor (the bed is unmade), a rickety wooden table and two chairs
along the far wall (we see a box of Sugar Pops on the table), a hot
plate, and an enormous color television near the mattress. The
television is on, but the sound is off. Images of commercials flicker
in the background during the rest of the scene. The only decoration is
a large black-and-white poster of Jim Morrison Scotch-taped to one of
the walls. Clothes are strewn everywhere: on the floor, on the table,
on top of the television set.

By the time RUBY has shut the door behind her, FELICITY has already
retreated to the other side of the room and is lighting a cigarette
from a pack of Newports on the table. No one says anything. An awkward
silence as FELICITY glares at her mother and AUGGIE.

		RUBY
 		(Finally)
	Well?

		FELICITY
	Well what?

		RUBY
	Aren't you going to say anything?

		FELICITY
	What do you want me to say?

		RUBY
	I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something
	like that.

		FELICITY
		(Takes a drag on her cigarette,
		 looking AUGGIE up and down. Then,
		 turning to RUBY)
	I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last
	week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

		AUGGIE
		(Muttering under his breath)
	Jesus Christ. This is all I need.

		RUBY
		(Trying to ignore the viciousness
		 of her daughter's remark)
	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here
	he is.

		FELICITY
	Yeah, I might have said that. Chico told me to
	see what he was like, maybe there'd be some
	dough in it for us. Well, now I've seen him,
	and I can't say I'm too impressed.
		(Pause. Turning to AUGGIE)
	Hey, mister. Are you rich or what?

		AUGGIE
		(Disgusted)
	Yeah, I'm a millionaire. I walk around in
	disguise because I'm ashamed of all my money.

		RUBY
		(To FELICITY. Imploringly)
	Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.

		FELICITY
		(Snaps back)
	Help? What the fuck do I need your help for?
	I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you
	can say for yourself, Hawkeye.

		AUGGIE
	Hey, hey, don't talk to your mother like that.

		FELICITY
		(Crushing out her cigarette on the
		 table. Ignoring AUGGIE'S remark,
		 to her mother)
	You're telling me you actually went to bed with
	this guy? You're telling me you actually let
	him fuck you?

		RUBY
		(Mortified, struggling not
		 to lose her composure)
	You can do whatever you want with your own life.
	We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want
	you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby.
	Before it's too late.

		FELICITY
	Baby? And what baby is that?

		RUBY
	Your baby. The baby you're carrying around
	inside you.

		FELICITY
	Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now.
	You dig? There's nothing in there now.

		RUBY
	What are you talking about?

		FELICITY
	An abortion, stupid.
		(Laughs bitterly)
	I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So
	you don't have to bug me about that shit
	anymore.
		(Laughs again. Defiantly,
		 almost to herself)
	Bye-bye, baby!

		AUGGIE
		(Taking hold of RUBY'S arm. RUBY is
		 about to break into tears)
	Come on, let's get out of here. I've had enough.

RUBY shrugs off AUGGIE'S hand and goes on looking at her daughter. As
FELICITY speaks, the camera closes in on her face.

		FELICITY
	Yeah, that's right, you better go. Chico'll be
	back any minute, and I'm sure your boyfriend
	doesn't want to mess with him. Chico's a real
	man. Not some scuzzy dickhead you find in last
	month's garbage. Do you hear what I'm saying?
	He'll chop up Mr. Dad here into little pieces.
	That's a promise. He'll kick the living shit
	out of him.

44.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

It is morning. RASHID is preparing a pot of coffee in the kitchenette.
PAUL stumbles out of the bathroom, wiping his face with a towel. He has
just woken up and is still groggy. He approaches the table.

		PAUL
	Ah, coffee. Smells good.

		RASHID
		(Handing him a cup)
	One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast
	open.

		PAUL
		(Taking the cup and sitting down)
	Thanks.
		(Begins to drink)

		RASHID
	What time did you get to bed last night?

		PAUL
	I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.

		RASHID
	You work too hard, you know that?

		PAUL
	Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let
	go.
		(Pause)
	Besides, I'm making up for lost time.

		RASHID
	Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to
	die of sleep deprivation before you finish.

		PAUL
		(Almost to himself. Looking up at
		 the photo of Ellen on the wall)
	If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you
	don't dream, you don't have nightmares.

		RASHID
	That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you
	don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.
		(Pause)
	So what's this story you're working on, anyway?

		PAUL
	If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.

		RASHID
	Come on, just a little hint.

		PAUL
		(Smiling at RASHID'S eagerness. Pause)
	Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the
	story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea
	for it.

		RASHID
	The inspiration.

		PAUL
	Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story
	anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?

		RASHID
	No way.

		PAUL
	All right. Listen carefully.
		(The camera slowly moves in
		 for a close-up of PAUL'S face)
	About twenty-five years ago, a young man went
	skiing alone in the Alps. There was an
	avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his
	body was never recovered.

		RASHID
		(Mockingly)
	The end.

		PAUL
	No, not the end. The beginning.
		(Pause)
	His son was just a little boy at the time, but
	the years passed, and when he grew up, he
	became a skier, too. One day last winter, he
	went out by himself for a run down the
	mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and
	then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock.
	Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he
	looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice --
	right there at his feet. He bends down to take
	a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's
	looking into a mirror, that he's looking at
	himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body
	is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of
	ice -- like someone preserved in suspended
	animation. He gets down on all fours, looks
	right into the dead man's face, and realizes
	that he's looking at his father.

Cut to RASHID'S face. We see him listening intently.

		PAUL (cont'd) (OFF)
	And the strange thing is that the father is
	younger than the son is now. The boy has become
	a man, and it turns out that he's older than
	his own father.

The camera holds on RASHID'S face. After a moment:

		PAUL (OFF)
	So what are you going to do today?

		RASHID (Shrugs)
	Read, think, do some drawings if I get in the
	mood.

He points to the coffee table: we see the sketch pad and a paperback
copy of Shakespeare's Othello.

		RASHID (cont'd)
	But tonight I'm going to celebrate. That's
	definite.

		PAUL
	Celebrate? What for?

 		RASHID
	It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old
		(looks at wristwatch)
	as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I
	should celebrate having made it this far.

		PAUL
		(Raising coffee cup)
	Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell
	me?

 		RASHID
		(Deadpan)
	I just did.

		PAUL
	I mean earlier. We could have planned something.

Close-up of RASHID'S face.

		RASHID
	I don't like plans. I prefer to take things as
	they come.

45.	INT: LATE AFTERNOON. THE BOOKSTORE

A small, cluttered independent bookshop.

The scene begins with a close-up of the clerk's face: APRIL LEE, a
Eurasian woman in her mid- to late twenties. She is sitting behind the
front counter with an open book before her. Her expression is puzzled,
searching, as if she has just remembered or recognized something, but
can't quite figure out what it is. We see her looking toward the back
of the store, straining to listen in on PAUL and RASHID'S conversation.

		RASHID (OFF)
	Here we are.
		(Pause)
	Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's
	letters.

                         PAUL (OFF)
	Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are
	open, you might as well take advantage of me.

As PAUL and RASHID start walking back in the direction of the counter,
APRIL lowers her gaze and pretends to be reading. We see PAUL and
RASHID enter the field of the camera from behind. PAUL puts a small
pile of art books on the counter.

		PAUL
	We'll take these, please.

APRIL looks up: her eyes meet PAUL'S. They study each other for a brief
moment -- a significant exchange that does not escape RASHID'S notice.

		APRIL
	Will that be cash or charge?

		PAUL
		(Taking out his wallet
		 and looking inside)
	Better make it charge.
		(Removes the credit card
		 and hands it to APRIL)

		APRIL
		(Looking at he card, smiles)
	I thought I recognized you. You're Paul
	Benjamin the writer, aren't you?

		PAUL
		(Both pleased and surprised)
	I confess.

		APRIL
	I keep waiting for the next novel to come out.
	Anything in the works?

		RASHID
		(Butting in, with enthusiasm)
	It's coming along. At the rate he's going,
	he'll have a story finished by the end of the
	summer.

		APRIL
	Wonderful. When your next book is published,
	maybe you could come into the store and do a
	signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people
	to show up.

		PAUL
		(Still staring at APRIL)
	Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind
	of thing.

		RASHID
		(To APRIL)
	Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married,
	are you?

		APRIL
		(Taken aback)
	What!

		RASHID
	Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I
	mean to say is, are you married or seriously
	involved with a significant other?

		APRIL
		(Still astonished. Bursts out laughing)
	No! At least I don't think I am!

		RASHID
		(Smiling with satisfaction)
	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending
	an invitation to you?

		APRIL
	An invitation?

Close-up of PAUL, listening to the exchange between RASHID and APRIL.

		RASHID
	Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing
	it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin
	and I are attending a celebration tonight, and
	we would be most pleased if you chose to
	accompany us.
		(Looking at PAUL)
	Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?

		PAUL
		(Breaking into a broad smile)
	Absolutely. We would be honored.

		APRIL
		(Smiling)
	And what's the occasion of this celebration?

		RASHID
	It's my birthday.

		APRIL
	And how many people will be attending this
	birthday party?

		RASHID
	I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more
	along the lines of a dinner in celebration of
	my birthday.
		(Pause)
	The guest list is quite restricted. So far,
	there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept,
	that would make three of us.

		APRIL
		(Ironic. With a crafty smile)
	Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't
	threesomes a little awkward? How does the
	phrase go--

		RASHID
	Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I
	have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he
	goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into
	trouble.

		APRIL
	And what are you, his chaperone?

		RASHID
		(With a straight face)
	Actually, I'm his father.

APRIL bursts out laughing, amused by the mounting silliness of the
conversation.

		PAUL
	It's true. Most people assume I'm his father.
	It's a logical assumption -- given that I'm
	older than he is and so on. But the fact is,
	it's the other way around. He's my father, and
	I'm his son.

Close-up of APRIL'S face. She is still laughing.

Cut to:

46.	INT: EVENING. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN BROOKLYN

In the background, we see a number of other customers. At one table, a
Chinese family is celebrating a birthday. Toward the end of the scene,
they all get up to pose for a group photograph. PAUL, RASHID, and
APRIL are sitting together at a round table. They are in the middle of
their meal.

		PAUL
	So your mother grew up in Shanghai?

		APRIL
	Until she was twelve. She moved here in
	'forty-nine.

		PAUL
	And your father? Is he from New York?

		APRIL
		(Smiling)
	Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as
	students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters
	and I were all born and bred right here.

 		PAUL
	Just like me.

		RASHID
	Like me, too.

 		APRIL
	I once read somewhere that one quarter of all
	the people in the United States have at least
	one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one
	time or another.

		RASHID
	No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.

		PAUL
		(To APRIL)
	And the bookstore? Have you been working there
	long?

		APRIL
	It's just a summer job. Something to help pay
	the bills while I finish my dissertation.

		PAUL
	Your dissertation? What subject do you study?

		APRIL
	American literature. What else?

		PAUL
	What else. Of course, what else? And what are
	you writing about for your thesis?

		APRIL
		(With mock pomposity)
	Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century
	American Fiction.

		PAUL
	Wow. You don't fool around, do you?

		APRIL
		(Smiling)
	Of course I fool around. But not so much when
	it comes to my work, it's true.
		(Pause)
	Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?

		PAUL
	Melville, huh?
		(Smiles)
	It's been a while.

		APRIL
	That's the subject of my last chapter.

		PAUL
	Not an easy book.

		APRIL
	Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest
	summer of my life.

		RASHID
	All the more reason to let 'er rip tonight,
	sweetheart.
		(Raises glass)
	You know, go for the gusto.

APRIL clinks her glass with RASHID and laughs merrily as PAUL looks on
and smiles. Cut to:

47.	INT: NIGHT. A BAR IN BROOKLYN

A noisy, crowded blue-collar hangout. APRIL, PAUL, and RASHID are
standing together, looking rather tipsy. They are engaged in animated
three-way conversation, but we can't hear their voices over the din.

A song is playing on the jukebox ("Downtown Train," by Tom Waits).
APRIL asks PAUL to dance. He agrees. As they dance, RASHID looks on.
Even though the rhythm of the song is fast, PAUL and APRIL dance
slowly, tentatively, not quite sure how to behave with each other.

After a moment, AUGGIE emerges from the back room with VIOLET, his
flashy girlfriend, hanging on his arm. They are both plastered.

		AUGGIE
		(Drunk, smiling)
	Hey, man, good to see you.

		PAUL
	This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to
	Auggie Wren.

		APRIL
		(Smiling)
	Hello, Auggie Wren.

		AUGGIE
		(Affecting the voice of a cowboy,
		 tipping an imaginary hat)
	Howdy, Miss April. I'm right pleased to make
	your acquaintance.
		(Turning to VIOLET)
	And this pretty little lady here is Miss
	Vi-o-let Sanchez de Jalapeño, the hottest chili
	pepper this side of the Rio Grande. Ain't that
	so, baby?

		VIOLET
	Ees so, Auggie. And you not so cold, neither.
	Eh, baby?

PAUL, APRIL, and RASHID nod hello to VIOLET.

		AUGGIE
	So, what brings you to a dive like this?

		PAUL
		(Gesturing with thumb to
		 RASHID; addressing AUGGIE)
	It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up
	a little.

		AUGGIE
		(To RASHID)
	How old, kid?

		RASHID
	Seventeen.

		AUGGIE
	Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen.
	Christ, I was one little whacked-out
	son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that
	what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy
	fella?

		RASHID
		(With feigned seriousness, nodding)
	Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the
	head.

		AUGGIE
	Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow
	up and become a great man like me.
		(Bursts out laughing)

PAUL puts his arm around AUGGIE, addressing him in quieter tones. As
they talk, APRIL and VIOLET look each other up and down, smiling
awkwardly. RASHID strains to hear what PAUL and AUGGIE are saying to
each other.

		PAUL
	Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You
	wouldn't need some help around the store, would
	you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?

		AUGGIE
		(Thinking)
	Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in
	mind?

		PAUL
	I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a
	good job for you.

		AUGGIE
		(Looking up and studying RASHID)
	Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got
	word from your employment agency that you're
	looking for a position in retail sales.

		RASHID
	A job?
		(Pause. Looks at PAUL)
	I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.

		AUGGIE
	Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning
	at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay?
	We'll see what we can work out.

		RASHID
	Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.

		PAUL
		(Patting AUGGIE on the back)
	I owe you one. Don't forget.

48.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Morning. PAUL and RASHID sitting at the table, eating breakfast. RASHID
is wearing a red T-shirt with the word "FIRE" emblazoned on the back in
white letters. We catch them in mid-conversation.

		PAUL
	It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad
	during the siege. I'm talking about one of the
	worst moments in human history. Five hundred
	thousand people died in that one place, and
	there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment,
	expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty
	of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he
	takes the pages of a manuscript he's been
	working on for ten years and tears them up to
	roll his cigarettes.

		RASHID
		(Incredulous)
	His only copy?

		PAUL
	His only copy.
		(Pause)
	I mean, if you think you're going to die,
	what's more important, a good book or a good
	smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and
	little by little he smoked his book.

		RASHID
		(Thinks, then smiles)
	Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no
	... no writer would ever do a thing like that.
		(Slight pause. Looking at PAUL)
	Would he?

		PAUL
		(Amused)
	You don't believe me, huh?
		(Stands up from the table and begins
		 walking to the bookcase)
	Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.

PAUL stands on a chair and reaches for a book on the top shelf. In
doing so, he catches sight of the paper bag RASHID planted there in
Scene 15. He studies it in bewilderment, then picks it up and dangles
it in the air as he turns toward RASHID.

		PAUL (cont'd)
	What's this?

		RASHID
		(Squirming with embarrassment)
	I don't know.

		PAUL
	Is it yours?

		RASHID
	Yeah, it might be.

		PAUL
		(Shrugs, not wanting to
		 make an issue of it)
	Here, catch.

PAUL tosses the bag in RASHID'S direction. The bag breaks open in
midair, and a shower of twenty-, fifty-, and hundred-dollar bills rains
down from the ceiling. PAUL is stunned; RASHID is watching the world
crumble before his eyes.

Fade out.

49. 	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT (LATER)

Fade in. A few minutes later. PAUL and RASHID are sitting at the table
again, the money stacked in neat piles between them. Again, we catch
them in mid-conversation.

		PAUL
	So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.

		RASHID
	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than
	I told you.

		PAUL
	Christ. You didn't just see what happened.
	They dropped the package on the ground and you
	picked it up.

		RASHID
	Yeah, I picked it up.

		PAUL
	And started to run.

		RASHID
	And started to run.

		PAUL
		(Sarcastic)
	Good thinking.

		RASHID
	That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.

		PAUL
	You have one hell of a knack for getting into
	trouble, don't you?
		(Pause, gesturing to the money)
	So how much does it come to?

		RASHID
	Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight
	hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.

		PAUL
		(Shaking his head, trying to
		 absorb this new turn of events)
	So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers
	are after you.

		RASHID
	That's it. In a nutshell.

		PAUL
	Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you
	did. If you want my opinion, you should give
	this money back to the Creeper. Just give it
	back and tell him you're sorry.

		RASHID
		(Shaking his head)
	No way. There's no way I'm giving that money
	back. It's my money now.

		PAUL
	A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper
	finds you.

		RASHID
		(Stubbornly)
	That money is my whole future.

		PAUL
	Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have
	a future.
		(Pause)
	Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that
	what you want?

Close-up of RASHID'S face. Fade out.

50.	INT: DAY. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

We see RASHID mopping the floor. He finishes up and carries the mop to
the bathroom behind the cash register and puts it in the bucket that is
sitting in the sink. He turns on the tap and rinses the mop. Just to
the side of the sink, there are two open cardboard boxes on the floor.
We catch a glimpse of the contents: boxes of Montecristos (Cuban
cigars). AUGGIE'S shipment from Miami has arrived.

RASHID turns off the tap, but the water continues to trickle out in a
small stream into the bucket. RASHID doesn't notice.

RASHID returns to the counter. AUGGIE is standing by the door getting
ready to go out. For the first time, he is clean-shaven, his hair is
combed, and he is wearing dress-up clothes: a bright red plaid sports
jacket, white slacks, etc. The effect is strange, laughable.

		AUGGIE
	I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the
	register while I'm gone, okay?

		RASHID
	Sure thing. See you later.

AUGGIE waves goodbye and leaves.

Cut to the bathroom. Close-up of the bucket in the sink. The water is
overflowing, spilling onto the boxes of Cuban cigars.

Cut to  the store. RASHID is sitting behind the counter, studying a
picture of a naked woman in Penthouse magazine.

Cut to bathroom. Close-up of water inundating the Cuban cigars.

Cut to store. Close-up of RASHID gaping at the photograph. We hear him
groan softly.

		RASHID
		(Muttering to himself)
	Jesus God, save me.

Dissolve.

The jarring noise of the door opening. RASHID hastily closes the
magazine and stashes it under the counter. AUGGIE enters the store with
two middle-aged men in dark, pin-striped suits: his lawyer-customers
for the Cuban cigars.

		AUGGIE
		(Addressing the TWO LAWYERS as they
		 enter. He is obviously keyed up. His
		 manner is jovial, ingratiating)
	It might be illegal, but it's hard to see where
	the crime is if there's no victim. No harm
	done, right?

		FIRST LAWYER
	This is what it must have felt like to go to a
	speakeasy during Prohibition

		SECOND LAWYER
 	Forbidden pleasures, eh?

		AUGGIE
		(To RASHID)
	Much business while I was gone?

		RASHID
	A little. Not much.

		AUGGIE
		(To the LAWYERS)
	This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office,
	shall we?

He points to the bathroom behind the counter.

The camera stays on RASHID as AUGGIE and the LAWYERS disappear. A
second later, we hear AUGGIE explode with rage.

		AUGGIE (OFF)
	What the fuck is going on here! Look at this!
	The goddamn place is flooded! Holy fucking
	shit! Look at this! Look at this goddamn mess!

51.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Close-up of RASHID'S face. He is in tears.

		PAUL (OFF)
	So you lost the job. Is that what you're
	telling me? He just up and fired you?

		RASHID
		(Scarcely able to speak)
	It was more complicated than that. There was a
	reason.

		PAUL (OFF)
	Well?

		RASHID
	It wasn't my fault.

		PAUL (OFF)
		(Irritated)
	If you don't tell me what happened, how do you
	expect me to know that? I need facts, not
	opinions.

                        RASHID
		(Struggling to speak,
		 fighting back the tears)
	The water was dripping, see... I turned it off,
	but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had
	to go out, and so I left the back room ... And
	later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie
	came back ... the whole place was flooded. His
	Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know,
	soaked through ... just when he was about to
	sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....

Shot of PAUL standing in the middle of the room looking at RASHID, who
is sitting on the bed.

		PAUL
	Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky
	going with those guys?

		RASHID
	I suppose so. He never told me about it.

		PAUL
	No wonder he was angry.

		RASHID
	He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He
	kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand
	bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop....
	Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks....
	He was like out of his mind with those five
	thousand bucks....

Silence. PAUL paces about the room, thinking. He sits down in a chair
by the table. Thinks some more.

		PAUL
	Here's what you're going to do. You're going to
	open up your backpack, take out your bag of
	money, count out five thousand dollars, and
	hand it over to Auggie.

		RASHID
		(Appalled)
	What are you talking about?
		(Pause)
	You can't be serious.

		PAUL
	I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it
	with Auggie. Since you won't give the money
	back to the Creeper, you can use it to make
	things right with Auggie. That's probably
	better anyway. Better to keep your friends than
	to worry about your enemies.

		RASHID
		(Stubbornly. Fresh tears
		 falling down his cheeks)
	I'm not going to do it.

		PAUL
	You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've
	got to undo the damage. That's how it works,
	buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw
	you out of here. Do you understand me? If you
	don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished
	with you.

		RASHID
	I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight
	hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.

		PAUL
	Don't worry about it. You've got friends now,
	remember? Just behave yourself, and everything
	will work out.

52.	INT: NIGHT. A BAR IN BROOKLYN

AUGGIE is sitting alone at the bar, smoking a cigarette and drinking a
beer. He looks disgusted: muttering to himself, swearing under his
breath. Business is slow, and the place is almost empty.

PAUL and RASHID enter and approach AUGGIE at the bar. RASHID is
carrying a brown paper bag. AUGGIE gestures with his head for them to
follow him into the back room. Cut to:

The three of them taking their seats at a table in the back room. A
long, awkward pause.

		PAUL
	The kid's sorry, Auggie.

		AUGGIE
		(Scowls, fiddles with the
		 napkin on the table)
	Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.
		(Pause)
	It took me three years to save up those five
	thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't
	hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of
	having my credibility destroyed. Do you
	understand what I'm saying? My credibility.
	So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as
	I've ever been in my whole fucking life.

		PAUL
	He's got something to tell you, Auggie.

		AUGGIE
	If he's got something to tell me, why don't he
	tell it to me himself?

Without saying a word, RASHID lifts the bag off his knees and puts it
on the table in front of AUGGIE. AUGGIE eyes the bag suspiciously.

		RASHID
	It's for you.

		AUGGIE
	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a
	paper bag?

		RASHID
	Open it.

		AUGGIE
		(Taking a peek inside)
	What is this, some kind of joke?

		RASHID
	No, it's five thousand dollars.

		AUGGIE
		(Disgusted)
	Shit. I don't want your money, you little
	twerp.
		(Peeking inside the paper bag again)
	It's probably stolen anyway.

		RASHID
	What do you care where it comes from? It's
	yours.

		AUGGIE
	And why the hell would you give me money?

		RASHID
	So I can get my job back.

		AUGGIE
	Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What
	do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?

		RASHID
	To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all
	the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me
	a cent.

		AUGGIE
	You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you
	know that?

Auggie pushes the bag toward RASHID. Without hesitating for a second,
RASHID pushes the bag back toward AUGGIE.

		PAUL
	Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it
	up to you, can't you see that?

		AUGGIE
		(Sighs, shakes head,
		 peeks into bag again)
	He's crazy.

		PAUL
	No, he's not. You are.

		AUGGIE
		(Shrugs. Begins to crack a smile)
	You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.

		PAUL
	It's written all over you like a neon sign.
	Now say something nice to Rashid to make him
	feel better.

		AUGGIE
		(Peeking into the bag again. Smiles)
	Fuck you, kid.

		RASHID
		(Beginning to smile)
	Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.

		PAUL
		(Pause. He laughs. Then, slapping
		 his hands on the table)
	Good. I'm glad that's settled!

53.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

PAUL is alone at his desk, typing. The keys suddenly stick, jam up.

		PAUL
		(Spreading his hands in front of his
		 face and addressing his fingers)
	Pay attention, boys. Look sharp.


54.	INT: DAY. PAUL'S APARTMENT

Several hours later. As before: PAUL alone at his desk, typing. A loud
knocking is heard at the door. PAUL continues typing. Another loud
knock on the door. PAUL sighs, stands up from his desk, and leaves the
workroom. Shot of PAUL walking through the big room and opening the
front door. Two black men are standing in the hallway. One is very
large, in his mid-thirties; the other is small, in his twenties. They
are Charles Clemm, THE CREEPER, and his sidekick, ROGER GOODWIN.

		CREEPER
	Mr. Benjamin, I presume?

Before PAUL can respond, CREEPER and GOODWIN push their way past him
into the apartment. GOODWIN slams the door behind him. PAUL backs up
nervously. He positions himself by the windows that look down at the
street.

		GOODWIN
	You got a security problem in this building,
	you know that? The lock on that door downstairs
	is busted.

		CREEPER
	Not a good idea in these troubled times. You
	never know what kind of trash might wander in
	off the streets.

		PAUL
		(Nervous)
	I'll talk to the landlord about it tomorrow.

		GOODWIN
	You do that. Don't want no unpleasant
	surprises, do you?

		PAUL
		(Looking them over)
	And who do I have the pleasure of talking to
	now?

		CREEPER
	Pleasure?
		(Laughs)
	I wouldn't call this pleasure, funny man. I'd
	say it's more in the nature of business.

		PAUL
	It doesn't matter. I know who you are anyway.
		(Pause)
	You're the Creeper, aren't you?

		CREEPER
		(Indignant)
	The what?

		GOODWIN
		(Whipping out a .45 automatic
		 and pointing it at PAUL)
	Ain't nobody calls Charles by that name to his
	face.
		(Grabs PAUL'S arm and puts
		 him in a hammerlock)
	Understand?

		PAUL
		(Grunting in pain)
	Sure, I understand.

Before GOODWIN can do any real violence, the CREEPER waves him off. At
that moment, PAUL glances out the window. Shot of RASHID down on the
street, approaching the building. Shot from RASHID'S POV: We see PAUL
upstairs with his back to the window, moving his hand with a shooing
gesture, trying to warn RASHID of the danger. Another shot of RASHID'S
face, puzzled. Another shot from RASHID'S POV: the CREEPER'S head
enters the picture. Another shot of RASHID: he takes off, running down
the street. As all this happens we hear the following:

		CREEPER (OFF)
	Let me tell you the business we're here about.
	We want your cooperation in helping us locate a
	certain party. We know he's been staying here,
	so we don't want no denials about it, understand?

		PAUL
	What party are you looking for?

		GOODWIN (OFF)
	Little Tommy Cole. A homeboy with a brain the
	size of a pea.

		PAUL (OFF)
		(Stalling)
	Tommy Cole? Never heard of him.

By now, RASHID is gone. Shot of PAUL'S face. He glances over his
shoulder at the street below. Shot of the street: no sight of RASHID
anywhere. Followed by a shot of PAUL, CREEPER, and GOODWIN standing in
the room.

		CREEPER
	I'm not sure you heard me the first time. We
	know that boy's been here.

		PAUL
	You might think you know, but you've got the
	wrong information. I never heard of anyone
	named Tommy Cole.

		GOODWIN
		(Strolling about the room. Sees
		 RASHID'S sketch pad on coffee table)
	Lookee here, Charles. Ain't cousin Tommy fond
	of doodling?

He picks up the pad, flips through it, and then starts ripping up the
drawings and tossing them on the floor.

		PAUL
	Hey, what the hell are you doing?

Before GOODWIN answers, CREEPER comes close to PAUL and without any
warning delivers a fast, powerful punch to his stomach. PAUL doubles
over in pain and falls to the floor.

		CREEPER
	So what's it going to be, funny man? Do you
	cooperate, or do we send you to the hospital?

		GOODWIN
		(Walking toward the bookcase,
		 addressing PAUL over his shoulder)
	Hope you got some good Blue Cross, baby.

GOODWIN suddenly starts pulling books off the shelves and sweeping them
violently onto the floor.


55.	EXT: DAY. IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

AUGGIE is standing with his arm on JIMMY ROSE'S shoulder. We catch them
in mid-conversation. AUGGIE is talking; JIMMY is doing his best to
follow him: looking down at the ground and nodding, surreptitiously
picking his nose. As they talk, we see PAUL walking down the street in
their direction. He is limping: one side of his face is bandaged, his
left arm is in a sling.

		AUGGIE
	... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't,
	it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying?
	You never know what's going to happen next, and
	the moment you think you know, that's the
	moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's
	what we call a paradox. Are you following me?

		JIMMY
	Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know
	nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that
	is. It's after you're dead and you go up to
	heaven and sit with the angels.

		AUGGIE
		(About to correct JIMMY when he
		 spots PAUL approaching the corner)
	Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.

		PAUL
		(Shrugs)
	It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't
	come, I might not be standing here now.

		AUGGIE
	Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?

                        PAUL
	No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out
	when they heard the sirens. But at least they
	stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.
		(Pause. Smiles)
	Assaultus interruptus.

                      AUGGIE
		(Studying PAUL'S wounds)
	Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.

		PAUL
	For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth
	shut. There's something to be said for that, I
	suppose.

JIMMY, who has been watching PAUL intently since his arrival, gently
and hesitantly raises his hand and touches PAUL'S bruised face. PAUL
winces slightly.

		JIMMY
	Does it hurt?

		AUGGIE
	Of course it hurts. What does it look like?

		JIMMY
		(Quietly)
	I thought maybe he was pretending.

		PAUL
		(To AUGGIE)
	You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?

		AUGGIE
	Not a peep.

		PAUL
	I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but
	she hasn't heard from him either. It's
	beginning to get a little scary.

		AUGGIE
	That could be a good sign, though. It could
	mean that he got away.

		PAUL
	Or didn't.
		(Pause)
	There's no way of knowing, is there?

56.	EXT: DAY. A BROOKLYN STREET

We see PAUL walking down the street, returning home. He spots a young
black man from behind. He is wearing the same red "FIRE" T-shirt that
RASHID was wearing in Scene 48. PAUL, growing excited, limps forward to
catch up with him. Once he gets close enough, he taps the young man on
 the shoulder.

		YOUNG MAN
		(Wheeling around as if he
		 had been attacked. Angrily)
	What the fuck you want, mister?

		PAUL
		(Embarrassed)
	I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

		YOUNG MAN
	I ain't someone else, got it? You can go fuck
	yourself with your someone else.

57.	INT: NIGHT. PAUL'S APARTMENT

PAUL, sitting in his easy chair, continues to work on his story by
hand. The apartment has more or less been put back in order, but
several traces of the CREEPER'S visit remain: bits of broken furniture,
a pile of destroyed books in one corner, etc.

After a few moments, PAUL gets up from his chair, walks over to the
television set, and turns it on. We hear the crowd noises of a baseball
game, the voice of the announcer describing the action, but there is no
image: Only a single white line across the black screen. PAUL mutters
under his breath and pounds the top of the TV. An image jumps into
view: a baseball game in progress. PAUL backs up to watch. The moment
he steps back, the image vanishes. Once again we see the white line
across the black screen. PAUL steps forward and pounds the TV again.
Nothing happens. He pounds again, and still the white line remains.
The camera moves in slowly for a close-up of the TV screen. The camera
travels through it, into the darkness. After a moment we hear the
clicking of PAUL'S keyboard. The sounds of typing resonate in the void.

58.	EXT: LATE MORNING. THE BROOKLYN PROMENADE

Sunday, late morning, brilliant sunshine. Against the backdrop of lower
Manhattan, we see the summer weekend crowd along the Promenade: old
people on benches reading newspapers, young couples out with their
babies, girls on roller skates, boys on skateboards, bag ladies, bums.
Traveling camera. Amongst the bustle of bodies and colors, we see the
Brooklyn Bridge off to the right, a spider web of cables set against
the buildings of upper Manhattan; to the left we see the expanse of New
York Harbor, the Staten Island ferry, the Statue of Liberty. AUGGIE and
RUBY are walking along the promenade, deep in conversation. AUGGIE is
clean-shaven, his hair is slicked back, and he is wearing his white
pants and a bright red Hawaiian shirt. RUBY is wearing sunglasses,
black toreador pants, and spike heels.

		AUGGIE
	So you're just going to give up and go home?

		RUBY
	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty
	clear she doesn't want me around.

		AUGGIE
		(Thinks)
	Still, you can't just write her off.

		RUBY
	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do?
	There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to
	throw away her life, that's her business.

		AUGGIE
	She's just a kid. There's time for more babies
	later. After she grows up.

		RUBY
	Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to
	her nineteenth birthday.

		AUGGIE
	Not if you got her into one of those rehab
	programs.

		RUBY
	I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even
	if I could, those things cost money. And that's
	just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.

		AUGGIE
	No you're not.

		RUBY
		(She stops)
	Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm
	broke. I don't even have insurance on my
	goddamned car.

		AUGGIE
		(Ignoring her remark)
	Remember that business venture I was telling
	you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.

		RUBY
		(Pouting)
	Bully for you.

		AUGGIE
	No, bully for you.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a long white envelope, and hands
it to RUBY.

		RUBY
	What's this?

 		AUGGIE
	Why don't you open it and find out?

		RUBY
		(Opens the envelope. It
		 is filled with cash)
	Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.

		AUGGIE
	Five thousand bucks.

		RUBY
		(Incredulous)
	And you're giving it to me?

		AUGGIE
	It's all yours, baby.

		RUBY
		(Moved, to the point of tears)
	For keeps?

		AUGGIE
	For keeps.

		RUBY
		(Now crying in earnest)
	I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.
		(Pause, to catch her breath)
	You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.

She tries to put her arms around him, but AUGGIE squirms away.

		AUGGIE
	Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough,
	Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand
	people who blubber.

		RUBY
	I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.

RUBY pulls a handkerchief from her purse and blows her nose, honking
loudly. AUGGIE lights a cigarette. After a moment they start walking
again.

		AUGGIE
	There's just one thing I want to know.

		RUBY
		(More composed)
	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.

AUGGIE stops walking.

		AUGGIE
	Felicity.
		(Pause)
	She's not my daughter, is she?

Long pause. Close-up of RUBY'S face.

		RUBY
	I don't know, Auggie. She might be. Then again,
	she might not. Mathematically speaking, there's
	a fifty-fifty chance. It's your call.

Close-up of AUGGIE'S face. After a moment, he begins to smile. Fade
out.

59.	EXT: DAY. SEVENTH AVENUE

We see PAUL walking down the crowded street with a manila envelope
tucked under his arm.

60.	INT: DAY. THE BOOKSTORE

We see APRIL behind the counter. She is ringing up a sale for a
CUSTOMER, an Indian woman dressed in a sari.

PAUL enters the store and approaches the counter. When APRIL looks up
and notices who it is, her face brightens -- then instantly shows alarm
at the sight of PAUL'S wounds and bandages. She completely forgets
about the customer.

		APRIL
	Jesus, what happened to you?

		PAUL
		(Shrugging it off)
	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.

		APRIL
	What happened?

		PAUL
	I'll tell you all about it...
		(Glancing around the store)
	... but not here.

		APRIL
		(Pause. Shyly)
	It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in
	touch.

		PAUL
	Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.
		(Pause)
	How's Melville?

		APRIL
	Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be
	there.

		CUSTOMER
		(Growing impatient)
	Miss, could I have my change, please?

		APRIL
	Oh, I'm sorry.
		(Hands the woman her change)

		CUSTOMER
	And my book.

		APRIL
	Sorry.
		(She slips the book -- Portrait of a Lady
		 -- into a bag and gives it to the woman)

The CUSTOMER leaves, glancing over her shoulder with a disapproving
look at APRIL and PAUL.

		PAUL
		(Extending the manila envelope to APRIL)
	I finished my story. I thought you might want
	to take a look at it.

		APRIL
		(Taking the envelope -- and at the same
		 moment understanding the significance
		 of PAUL'S gesture. She begins to smile)
	I'd love to.

		PAUL
	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in
	coming.

		APRIL
		(Glancing at her watch)
	I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat
	you to a hamburger?

		PAUL
		(Awkwardly)
	Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read
	the story first. Call me when you're finished,
	okay?

		APRIL
		(A bit mystified, but putting a
		 good face on her disappointment)
	Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you
	tomorrow.
		(Weighing the envelope in her hand)
	It doesn't seem to be too long.

		PAUL
	Forty-one pages.

Another CUSTOMER -- a young white man of about twenty -- appears at
the counter with a copy of On the Road. PAUL begins backing toward the
door.

		PAUL (cont'd)
	You won't forget to call?

		APRIL
	I won't forget. I promise.

61.	INT: NIGHT. PAUL'S APARTMENT

The telephone rings -- two, three, four times -- but no one is there to
answer it. Cut to:

62	INT: NIGHT. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

Shot of the empty store. We hear a telephone ringing in the distance.

63.	INT: NIGHT. AUGGIE'S APARTMENT

AUGGIE is sitting alone at his kitchen table, removing recently
developed photographs from a yellow Kodak envelope. The 1990 album lies
open on the table before him. One by one, AUGGIE affixes a small white
label to the lower-right-hand corner of each image, carefully marking
the date on each label with a pen: 7-30-90, 7-31-90; 8-1-90; etc. Then,
one by one, he slips each photo into its appropriate place in the
album. AUGGIE smokes a cigarette, hums a song under his breath, sips
from a glass of bourbon. He looks like a beachcomber: unshaven, tousled
hair, bare-chested, wearing a pair of baggy shorts.

The telephone is ringing. Not to be rushed, AUGGIE slides another photo
 into its place, takes a sip of his drink, and then, finally, answers
the phone.

		AUGGIE
	Bureau of Missing Persons. Sergeant Fosdick.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Well, blow me down. Peter Rabbit's alive.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Yeah, that's cool.  No problem.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Danzinger Road, Peekskill.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Yeah, I got it. I don't need no pencil.
		(Pause. Listens)
	How the hell do I know? I can't help it if he's
	not answering his phone.
		(Pause. Listens)
	So you're the one who called the cops, huh?
	Good work.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Yeah, I mean it. Good work. It probably saved
	his skin.
		(Pause. Listens)
	You got that right. Bad. You owe him a lot,
	keemosabbe.
		(Pause. Listens)
	No, not tomorrow. I have to work, chuckle
	brain -- remember?
		(Pause. Listens)
	No, not Saturday either. Sunday.
		(Pause. Listens)
	Yeah. Right. Okay.
		(Smiles)
	Yeah, and kiss my ass, too.
		(Pause. Listens. Smiles again)
	You, too.
		(Hangs up the phone)

64.	EXT: DAY. PAUL'S STREET

Sunday morning. PAUL and AUGGIE are walking together on the sidewalk.
PAUL is carrying RASHID'S backpack.

		PAUL
	So what did he say when he called?

                      AUGGIE
	Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants
	were dirty, and would we mind driving up with
	his things.
		(Pause)
	Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted
	every time.

AUGGIE stops in front of a car parked at the curb: a fifteen-year-old
red Coupe de Ville.

		PAUL
		(Impressed)
	Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?

		AUGGIE
	It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.

AUGGIE unlocks the door on the passenger side, then walks around the
car to unlock the door on the driver's side.

		PAUL
		(Opening the door)
	It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a
	half. We'll be back in time for dinner.

		AUGGIE
	We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of
	Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about
	to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be
	on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.

They both climb into the car. AUGGIE starts up the engine. Cut to:

65.	INT/EXT: DAY. PEEKSKILL. COLE'S GARAGE

We see RASHID painting the walls in the upstairs room. The room has
been transformed since the last time we saw it. It is entirely bare now
and neat as a pin. With each touch of white paint that RASHID applies
to the walls, the look of the place improves. He works with care, proud
of what he has accomplished so far.

Suddenly: the noise of a car down below. RASHID goes to the open window
and looks out. Cut to:

From RASHID'S POV: We see CYRUS, DOREEN, and JUNIOR pull up in the blue
Ford. They get out. DOREEN is carrying a large picnic cooler. CYRUS
opens the back door and unbuckles JUNIOR from his seat.

		RASHID (OFF)
		(Mumbling, alarm in his voice)
	Oh, Jesus. What are they doing here on Sunday?

		DOREEN
		(Waving up to RASHID)
	Hi, Paul. We decided to have a picnic. Want to
	join us?

Cut to RASHID at the window:

		RASHID
	Uh, yeah, sure.
		(Pause)
	Just a minute. I'll be down in a minute.

Cut to RASHID in the upstairs room. He crouches down, puts the brush he
has been working with on top of the open paint can, and begins wiping
his hands with a rag when, suddenly, the noise of another car is heard
down below. RASHID stands up to have a look. Cut to:

From RASHID'S POV: We see the red Coupe de Ville limping into the
station with a flat tire. The car stops. PAUL and AUGGIE climb out.
Cut to:

Close-up of RASHID, looking out the window. His face registers panic,
alarm.

		RASHID
	Jesus Christ!

He begins running toward the door, hoping to get downstairs to PAUL and
AUGGIE before CYRUS can reach them. In his haste, he kicks over the
open paint bucket.

The scene ends with a close-up of white paint oozing over the bare wood
floor.

66.	EXT: DAY. IN FRONT OF COLE'S GARAGE

Shot of CYRUS, DOREEN, and JUNIOR by the picnic table, unpacking their
lunch. The camera pans from CYRUS -- beginning to walk toward PAUL and
AUGGIE -- to PAUL and AUGGIE, who are standing by the gas pumps. We see
PAUL and AUGGIE looking in the direction of the office, smiles
beginning to form on their faces. At the precise instant CYRUS gets to
them, RASHID enters the frame, panting hard from his dash down the
stairs.

		PAUL
		(To RASHID)
	Hi, kid.

		RASHID
		(Looking at PAUL'S wounds and
		 bandages. He is shocked)
	Wow. They sure did a job on you.

		PAUL
	Research. I worked the scene right into my
	story.
		(Pause)
	That makes the medical bills one hundred
	percent tax deductible.

		AUGGIE
		(Under his breath)
	Try selling that one to the IRS.

		CYRUS
		(Watching the exchange with a
		 confused look on his face. To RASHID)
	You know these men?
		(Gesturing to the flat tire)
	I thought we had some customers.

		AUGGIE
	Yeah, he knows us. But you've also got some
	customers.
		(Wheels around and kicks
		 the Coupe de Ville)
	Fucking Tommy. Leave it to him to drive around
	with bald tires.

		PAUL
	We came here to deliver some clean laundry.

		RASHID
		(To CYRUS)
	It's all right. I really do know them.

		CYRUS
		(Still confused, but
		 trying to be friendly)
	I'm the owner here. Cyrus Cole.
		(Extends his right hand to AUGGIE)

		AUGGIE
		(Shaking CYRUS'S hand)
	Augustus Wren.

CYRUS extends his right hand to PAUL.

		PAUL
		(Shaking CYRUS'S hand)
	Paul Benjamin.

Cut to close-up of RASHID'S face. The sky has just fallen on top of
him.

		CYRUS
		(More confused than ever.
		 Turning to RASHID)
	That's funny. His name is the same as yours.

		RASHID
		(In a panic)
	Well, you and Junior have the same name, too,
	don't you?

		CYRUS
	Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about
	that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here
	you got the same name as this man here, and
	you're not even the same color.

		RASHID
		(Improvising)
	That's how we met. We're members of the
	International Same Name Club. Believe it or
	not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America.
	But only two in the New York metropolitan area.
	That's how Paul and I got to be such good
	friends. We're the only ones who show up at
	the meetings.

		AUGGIE
		(Disgusted)
	You're full of crap, kid. Why don't you just
	come clean and tell the man who you are?

By now, drawn by curiosity, DOREEN has come over to where the four men
are standing. She is carrying JUNIOR in her arms.

		CYRUS
		(Turning to PAUL)
	What the hell's going on, mister?

		PAUL
		(Shrugs, gestures to RASHID)
	You better ask him.

		AUGGIE
	Yeah, Rashid baby, spill it.

		DOREEN
		(In a loud voice)
	Rashid?

		PAUL
		(To DOREEN)
	Sometimes. It's what you'd call a nom de
	guerre.

		CYRUS
		(More and more confused)
	What the hell are we talking about?

		AUGGIE
		(To RASHID)
	Come on. Tell him your real name. The name on
	your birth certificate.

Close-up of RASHID'S face. His lower lip is trembling. Tears are
beginning to form in his eyes.

		RASHID
		(Almost inaudibly)
	Thomas.

		CYRUS
	Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?

		RASHID
	Thomas.

		 AUGGIE
		(Impatient)
	Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole
	thing. First name and last name.

		RASHID
		(Trying to stall. Tears begin
		 to slide down his cheeks)
	What difference does it make?

		PAUL
	If it doesn't make any difference, why not just
	say it?

		RASHID
		(To PAUL, his voice breaking)
	I was going to tell him ... but in my own time.
	In my own time... .

		AUGGIE
	No time like the present, man.

		CYRUS
		(To RASHID)
	Well?

		RASHID
		(Blinking back the tears.
		 Looking at CYRUS)
	Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.

		CYRUS
		(thunderstruck)
	Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do
	you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand
	there and mock me!

		DOREEN
		(Upset)
	Cyrus!

		JUNIOR
		(Reaching out to CYRUS)
	Dada.

		RASHID
		(Standing his ground)
	Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole.
	Just like yours.

		PAUL
		(To CYRUS)
	Now ask him who his mother was.

		CYRUS
		(Beside himself)
	I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.

		RASHID
	Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?

		CYRUS
	You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!

Unable to control his rage, CYRUS hauls off and slugs RASHID in the
face. RASHID falls to the ground.

		AUGGIE
		(Alarmed)
	Hey, cut it out!

AUGGIE takes a wild swing and clips CYRUS in the mouth. DOREEN, seeing
her husband attacked, gives AUGGIE a quick kick in the shins. AUGGIE
lets out a yell and starts hopping up and down in pain.

		DOREEN
		(To AUGGIE)
	Damn you. There'll be none of that on my watch,
	you dumpy bag of shit.

DOREEN puts down JUNIOR. The little boy immediately runs over to PAUL
and whacks him on his bad arm. PAUL howls in pain and drops to the
ground. The whole scene is quickly degenerating into chaos.

In the meantime, RASHID has climbed back to his feet. He lines up
CYRUS, rushes toward him, and tackles him to the ground. The two of
them roll around on the macadam, fighting with all their strength.
After a moment, it looks as though CYRUS is getting the better of the
struggle. AUGGIE tries to pull them apart, but to no avail.

		DOREEN (cont'd)
		(Pounding CYRUS on the
		 back with her fists)
	Stop it! Stop it! You'll kill him, Cyrus!

DOREEN'S shrieking voice brings the fight to a momentary halt. CYRUS
rolls off RASHID and stands up. RASHID stands up as well. But the
hatred between them has not subsided. CYRUS raises his hook.

		DOREEN (cont'd)
		(Screaming)
	He's your son, goddammit! He's your son! Do you
	want to kill your son?

Suddenly: CYRUS stops. He lowers his arm and buries his face in his
right hand. A moment later, he breaks down and weeps. His sobbing makes
a terrible sound: pure, animal misery. He staggers around, then falls
to his knees, unable to stop the tears.

Cut to RASHID. He stands there without moving, watching CYRUS. He drops
his arms to his sides, unclenches his fists. Tears are pouring down his
cheeks, he is breathing hard. Close-up of his face.

Fade out.

67.	EXT: DAY. THE PICNIC TABLE OUTSIDE COLE'S GARAGE

Some time later.

Long shot. We see everyone from the previous scene sitting at the
picnic table eating lunch: fried chicken, lemonade, potato chips, etc.
The image has the effect of a still life.

DOREEN is sitting next to CYRUS. RASHID is holding JUNIOR in his arms,
gently rocking him as the child drinks milk from a bottle with his eyes
closed. AUGGIE and PAUL are sitting next to each other, eating chicken
and listening to DOREEN (who is the only one who has the energy to
talk). CYRUS looks sullen, defeated. Every once in a while, he steals a
glance at RASHID. RASHID, however, pretends to ignore him, keeping his
eyes fixed on the sleeping JUNIOR.

At first we hear nothing. Then the camera moves in for a closer shot
and we can begin to make out what DOREEN is saying. As she speaks, we
see Paul reach into his pocket and take out a tin of his little cigars.
He leans forward and offers one to CYRUS, but CYRUS reaches into his
own pocket and offers PAUL a big cigar. Paul accepts and lights up.
CYRUS then lights up one of his own.

		DOREEN
	... It might not have been the smartest
	investment, but it didn't cost much, and if
	Cyrus can make a go of it, we'll be able to
	take care of our needs. The man knows his way
	around cars, I'll tell you that, but the
	problem is this road is too far off the beaten
	track. Ever since they put in that mall, the
	traffic hasn't been too heavy around here. But
	you take the good with the bad, right? You do
	your best and hope that things work out...

Music begins to play. Cut to:

68. 	BLACK SCREEN

The music continues. After a few moments, the following words appear on
the screen: "THREE MONTHS LATER."

69.	EXT: DAY. ELEVATED SUBWAY, BROOKLYN

The music continues to play. We see an elevated subway train snaking
along the tracks in the dim November light.

70. 	INT: DAY. THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO.

AUGGIE is behind the counter, wearing a flannel shirt. The three OTB
MEN are there with him, as in Scene 2. JIMMY enters the store and
places a paper bag on the counter in front of AUGGIE, then slides
around the counter and takes a seat beside AUGGIE. JIMMY studies his
watch. AUGGIE removes a cup of take-out coffee from the bag. He lifts
off the cover and steam rises from the cup. In the meantime, we see and
hear the OTB MEN talking.

		TOMMY
	Of course there's gonna be a war. You think
	they'd send five hundred thousand troops over
	there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's
	plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of
	water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no
	seaside holiday, you can bet on that.

		JERRY
	I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a
	rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about
	the head sheik over there. He marries a
	different virgin every Friday and then divorces
	her on Monday. You think we want to have our
	kids dying for a guy like that?

		DENNIS
	That's one way of upholding American values,
	eh, Tommy?

		TOMMY
	Laugh all you want. I'm telling you there's
	gonna be a war. With things in Russia falling
	apart, those slobs in the Pentagon'll be out of
	work unless they find a new enemy. They got
	this Saddam character now, and they're going to
	hit him with all they've got. Mark my words.

PAUL enters the store wearing a scarf and leather jacket. The OTB MEN
stop talking and study him as he approaches the counter.

		AUGGIE
		(To PAUL)
	Hey, man, how's it going?

		PAUL
	Hi, Auggie.

Without waiting for PAUL to ask, AUGGIE turns around, pulls out two
tins of Schimmelpennincks from the cigar cabinet, and places them on
the counter.

		AUGGIE
	Two, right?

		PAUL
	Uh, better make it one.

		AUGGIE
	You usually get two.

		PAUL
	Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.
		(Pause)
	Somebody's worried about my health.

		AUGGIE
		(Twitching his eyebrows playfully)
	Ah-hah.

PAUL shrugs with embarrassment, then slowly breaks into a warm smile.

		AUGGIE (cont'd)
	And how's the work going these days, maestro?

		PAUL
		(Still grinning. Absentmindedly)
	Fine.
		(Pause. Pulling himself together)
	Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy
	from The New York Times called and asked me
	to write a Christmas story. They want to
	publish it on Christmas Day.

		AUGGIE
	That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper
	of record.

		PAUL
	Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days
	to come up with something, and I don't have a
	single idea.
		(Pause)
	You know anything about Christmas stories?

		AUGGIE
		(Blustering)
	Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.

		PAUL
	Anything good?

	 		AUGGIE
	Good? Of course. Are you kidding?
		(Pause)
	I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend,
	and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you
	ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every
	word of it is true.

		PAUL
		(Smiling)
	It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be
	good.

		AUGGIE
		(Turning to JIMMY ROSE)
	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay,
	Jimmy?
		(Begins to extricate himself
		 from behind the counter)

		JIMMY ROSE
	You want me to do it, Auggie? You sure you want
	me to do it?

		AUGGIE
	Sure I'm sure. Just remember what I taught you.
	And don't let any of these kibitzers cause
	you trouble.
		(Gestures to OTB MEN)
	You got a problem, you come and see me. I'll
	be down the block at Jack's.
		(To PAUL)
	Jack's okay?

		PAUL
	Jack's is fine.

PAUL and AUGGIE leave the store together.

71.	INT: DAY. JACK'S RESTAURANT

A cramped and boisterous kosher delicatessen with sports photographs on
the walls: old Brooklyn Dodger teams, the 1969 Mets, a portrait of
Jackie Robinson. PAUL and AUGGIE are sitting at a table in the back,
studying the menus.

		PAUL
		(Closing menu)
	I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me
	a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?

		AUGGIE
	You got it.

PAUL stands up and leaves to go to the men's room. Alone at the table,
AUGGIE glances down at the empty chair next to him and sees a copy of
the New York Post. The paper is open to an article with a headline that
reads: "SHOOTOUT IN BROOKLYN." AUGGIE bends over to inspect the article
more closely. Close-up of the article. We see photographs of CHARLES
CLEMM (the CREEPER) and ROBERT GOODWIN and their names in the captions.
A secondary headline reads: "ROBBERS KILLED IN JEWEL HEIST." In the
meantime, as AUGGIE continues to study the article, the WAITER arrives
to take his order. He is a round, balding, middle-aged man with a weary
expression on his face.

		WAITER (OFF)
	What'll it be, Auggie?

		AUGGIE
		(Looking up)
	Uh...
		(Pointing to PAUL'S empty place)
	My friend over here would like a corned beef on
	rye and a ginger ale.

Shot of WAITER holding pencil and order pad.

		WAITER
	And what about for you?

		AUGGIE
		(Reading the paper again. Suddenly
		 remembers the WAITER is there)
	Huh?

		WAITER
	What about for you?

		AUGGIE
	For me?
		(Pause)
	I'll have the same thing.
		(Looks down at the article again)

		WAITER
	Do me a favor, will you?

		AUGGIE
		(Glancing up again)
	What's that, Sol?

		WAITER
	Next time, when you want two corned beef
	sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
	When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two
	ginger ales."

		AUGGIE
	What's the difference?

		WAITER
	It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go
	faster.

		AUGGIE
		(Mystified. Humoring the WAITER)
	Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of
	saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then,
	"Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two
	corned beef sandwiches."

		WAITER
		(Deadpan)
	Thanks. I knew you'd understand.

The WAITER leaves. AUGGIE looks down at the article again. PAUL returns
and sits down in his chair across from AUGGIE.

		PAUL
		(Settling in)
	So. Are we ready?

		AUGGIE
	Ready. Any time you are.

		PAUL
	I'm all ears.

		AUGGIE
	Okay.
		(Pause. Thinks)
	You remember how you once asked me how I
	started taking pictures? Well, this is the
	story of how I got my first camera. As a matter
	of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had.
	Are you following me so far?

		PAUL
	Every word.

		AUGGIE
		(Close-up of AUGGIE'S face)
	Okay.
		(Pause)
	So this is the story of how it happened.
		(Pause)
	Okay.
		(Pause)
	It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I
	first started working for Vinnie. The summer of
	the bicentennial.
		(Pause)
	A kid came in one morning and started stealing
	things from the store. He's standing by the
	rack of paperbacks near the front window
	stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It
	was crowded around the counter just then, so I
	didn't see him at first....

AUGGIE'S face dissolves into PAUL'S. Black-and-white footage begins: we
see AUGGIE acting out the events he describes to PAUL. This scene
exactly duplicates the events shown earlier in Scenes 2 and 3 -- with
one difference. The thief is now ROGER GOODWIN, the same person who
beat up PAUL in Scene 54, the same person whose picture AUGGIE has just
noticed in the newspaper. The events unfold in silence, accompanied by
AUGGIE'S voice-over narration.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	But once I noticed what he was up to, I started
	to shout. He took off like a jackrabbit, and by
	the time I managed to get out from behind the
	counter, he was already tearing down Seventh
	Avenue. I chased after him for about half a
	block, and then I gave up. He'd dropped
	something along the way, and since I didn't
	feel like running anymore, I bent down to see
	what it was.

We see AUGGIE chasing the kid, giving up, and bending down for the
wallet. He starts walking back to the store.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	It turned out to be his wallet. There wasn't
	any money inside, but his driver's license was
	there, along with three or four snapshots. I
	suppose I could have called the cops and had
	him arrested. I had his name and address from
	the license, but I felt kind of sorry for him.
	He was just a measly little punk, and once I
	looked at those pictures in his wallet, I
	couldn't bring myself to feel very angry at
	him....

We see AUGGIE examining the pictures. Close-ups of the pictures.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	Roger Goodwin. That was his name. In one of the
	pictures, I remember, he was standing next to
	his mother. In another one, he was holding some
	trophy he got from school and smiling like he
	just won the Irish Sweepstakes. I just didn't
	have the heart. A poor kid from Brooklyn
	without much going for him, and who cared about
	a couple of dirty magazines, anyway?

Cut to Jack's Restaurant. The WAITER arrives at the table with their
orders.

		WAITER
	Here you go, boys. Two corned beef sandwiches.
	Two ginger ales. The fast way. The simple way.
		(He leaves)

		PAUL
		(Putting mustard on his sandwich)
	And?

		AUGGIE
		(Taking a sip of his drink)
	So I held onto the wallet. Every once in a
	while I'd get a little urge to send it back to
	him, but I kept delaying and never did anything
	about it.
		(Puts mustard on his sandwich)
	Then Christmas rolls around, and I'm stuck with
	nothing to do. Vinnie was going to invite me
	over, but his mother got sick, and he and his
	wife had to go down to Florida at the last
	minute.
		(Takes a bite of the sandwich, chews)
	So I'm sitting in my apartment that morning,
	feeling a little sorry for myself, and then I
	see Roger Goodwin's wallet lying on a shelf in
	the kitchen. I figure what the hell, why not do
	something nice for once, and I put on my coat
	and go out to return the wallet... .

Cut to black-and-white footage: the housing projects in Boerum Hill. We
see AUGGIE wandering alone among the buildings, bundled up against the
cold. At the same time, we hear:

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	The address was over in Boerum Hill, somewhere
	in the projects. It was freezing out that day,
	and I remember getting lost a few times trying
	to find the right building. Everything looks
	the same in that place, and you keep going over
	the same ground thinking you're somewhere else.
	Anyway, I finally get to the apartment I'm
	looking for and ring the bell...

Shot of AUGGIE walking down a corridor in the housing projects;
graffiti on the cinder-block walls. He stops in front of a door and
pushes the buzzer.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	Nothing happens. I assume no one's there, but I
	try again just to make sure. I wait a little
	longer, and just when I'm about to give up, I
	hear someone shuffling to the door. An old
	woman's voice asks, "Who's there?" and I say
	I'm looking for Roger Goodwin. "Is that you,
	Roger?" the old woman says, and then she undoes
	about fifteen locks and opens the door....

Shot of a very old black woman, GRANNY ETHEL, opening the door. A
rapturous, expectant smile is on her face. Even though the scene
unfolds in silence, we see AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL mouthing the
dialogue that AUGGIE repeats to PAUL.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	She has to be at least eighty, maybe ninety
	years old, and the first thing I notice about
	her is she's blind. "I knew you'd come. Roger,"
	she says. "I knew you wouldn't forget your
	Granny Ethel on Christmas." And then she opens
	her arms as if she's about to hug me.

We see AUGGIE hesitate for a second. As he reports the next little part
of the story, we see him giving in, opening his arms, and hugging
GRANNY ETHEL. The hug is then repeated in somewhat slower motion, then
again in slow motion; then again, in very slow motion: then again in
motion so slow that it appears as a sequence of still photographs.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	I don't have much time to think, you understand.
	I had to say something real fast, and before I
	knew what was happening, I could hear the words
	coming out of my mouth. "That's right, Granny
	Ethel," I said. "I came back to see you on
	Christmas." Don't ask me why I did it. I don't
	have any idea. It just came out that way, and
	suddenly this old woman's hugging me there in
	front of the door, and I'm hugging her back. It
	was like a game we both decided to play --
	without having to discuss the rules. I mean,
	that woman knew I wasn't her grandson. She was
	old and dotty, but she wasn't so far gone that
	she couldn't tell the difference between a
	stranger and her own flesh and blood. But it
	made her happy to pretend, and since I had
	nothing better to do anyway, I was happy to go
	along with her....

AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL enter the apartment and sit down in chairs in
the living room. We see them talking, laughing. Meanwhile, we hear:

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	So we went into the apartment and spent the day
	together. Every time she asked me a question
	about how I was, I would lie to her. I told her
	I'd found a good job in a cigar store. I told
	her I was about to get married. I told her a
	hundred pretty stories, and she made like she
	believed every one of them. "That's fine,
	Roger," she would say, nodding her head and
	smiling. "I always knew things would work out
	for you...."

The camera pans slowly through GRANNY ETHEL'S apartment, lingering
momentarily on various objects. Among other things, we see portraits of
Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, family photographs, balls of
yarn, knitting needles. By the time this visual tour is completed, we
see AUGGIE entering the apartment again, wearing his coat and carrying
a large bag of groceries. As described in the simultaneous narration:

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	After a while, I started getting hungry. There
	didn't seem to be much food in the house, so I
	went out to a store in the neighborhood and
	brought back a mess of stuff. A precooked
	chicken, vegetable soup, a bucket of potato
	salad, all kinds of things. Ethel had a couple
	of bottles of wine stashed in her bedroom, and
	so between us we managed to put together a
	fairly decent Christmas dinner....

We see AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL at the dining-room table: eating the
food, drinking the wine, talking.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	We both got a little tipsy from the wine, I
	remember, and after the meal was over we went
	out to sit in the living room where the chairs
	were more comfortable...

We see AUGGIE leading GRANNY ETHEL by the arm and helping her into a
chair. Then AUGGIE leaves the living room and walks to the bathroom
down the hall.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	I had to take a pee, so I excused myself and
	went to the bathroom down the hall. That's
	where things took another turn. It was ditsy
	enough doing my little jig as Ethel's
	grandson, but what I did next was positively
	crazy, and I've never forgiven myself for
	it....

We see AUGGIE in the bathroom. As he pees, we see the boxes of cameras,
just as he describes them.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	I go into the bathroom, and stacked up against
	the wall next to the shower, I see a pile of
	six or seven cameras. Brand-new, thirty-five
	millimeter cameras, still in their boxes. I
	figure this is the work of the real Roger, a
	storage place for one of his recent hauls.
	I've never taken a picture in my life, and I've
	certainly never stolen anything, but the moment
	I see those cameras sitting in the bathroom, I
	decide I want one of them for myself. Just like
	that. And without even stopping to think about
	it, I tuck one of the boxes under my arm and go
	back to the living room....

We see AUGGIE return to the living room with the camera. GRANNY ETHEL
is sleeping soundly in her chair. AUGGIE puts the camera down, clears
the table, and washes the dishes in the kitchen.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	I couldn't have been gone for more than three
	minutes, but in that time Granny Ethel had
	fallen asleep. Too much Chianti, I suppose. I
	went into the kitchen to wash the dishes, and
	she slept on through the whole racket, snoring
	like a baby. There didn't seem to be any point
	in disturbing her, so I decided to leave. I
	couldn't even write a note to say good-bye,
	seeing that she was blind and all, so I just
	left. I put her grandson's wallet on the table,
	picked up the camera again, and walked out of
	the apartment... .

We see AUGGIE bending over the sleeping GRANNY ETHEL and deciding not
to wake her. We see him put the wallet on the table and pick up the
camera. We see him walking out of the apartment. Shot of the closing
door.

		AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
	And that's the end of the story.

Cut to PAUL'S face. PAUL and AUGGIE are sitting at the table, eating
the last bites of their sandwiches.

		PAUL
	Did you ever go back to see her?

		AUGGIE
	Once, about three or four months later. I felt
	so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't
	even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to
	return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there
	anymore. Someone else had moved into the
	apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she
	was.

		PAUL
	She probably died.

		AUGGIE
	Yeah, probably.

		PAUL
 	Which means that she spent her last Christmas
	with you.

		AUGGIE
	I guess so. I never thought of it that way.

		PAUL
	It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing
	you did for her.

		AUGGIE
	I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I
	don't see how you can call that a good deed.

		PAUL
	You made her happy. And the camera was stolen
	anyway. It's not as if the person you took it
	from really owned it.

		AUGGIE
	Anything for art, eh, Paul?

		PAUL
	I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put
	the camera to good use.

		AUGGIE
	And now you've got your Christmas story, don't
	you?

		PAUL
		(Pause. Thinks)
	Yes, I suppose I do.

PAUL looks at AUGGIE. A wicked grin is spreading across AUGGIE'S face.
The look in his eyes is so mysterious, so fraught with the glow of some
inner delight, that PAUL begins to suspect that AUGGIE has made the
whole thing up. He is about to ask AUGGIE if he has been putting him on
-- but then stops, realizing that AUGGIE would never tell him. PAUL
smiles.

		PAUL (cont'd)
	Bullshit is a real talent, Auggie. To make up a
	good story, a person has to know how to push
	all the right buttons.
		(Pause)
	I'd say you're up there among the masters.

		AUGGIE
	What do you mean?

		PAUL
	I mean, it's a good story.

		AUGGIE
	Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your
	friends, what kind of friend are you?

		PAUL
	Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living,
	would it?

AUGGIE is still smiling. PAUL smiles back at him. AUGGIE lights a
cigarette; PAUL lights a little cigar. They blow smoke into the air,
still smiling at each other.

The camera follows the smoke as it rises toward the ceiling. Close-up
of the smoke. Hold for three, four beats.

The screen goes black. Music begins to play. Final credits.
