The film follows the lives of multiple characters, all of whom are connected by their patronage of a small Brooklyn tobacco shop managed by Auggie (Harvey Keitel).
Brooklyn Cigar Co. was located on the corner of 16th Street and Prospect Park West.

The film was followed by Blue in the Face, a sequel of sorts that continues following a few of the characters and introduces several new ones.
