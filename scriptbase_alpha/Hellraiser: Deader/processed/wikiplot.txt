Investigative reporter Amy Klein (Kari Wührer) is sent to Bucharest to investigate the origins of a video tape apparently depicting the ritualistic murder—and subsequent resurrection—of a member of a cult calling themselves "The Deaders".
In Bucharest, Amy tracks down the return address of the VHS and discovers the corpse of a girl holding a puzzle box, the Lament Configuration.
Solving the box causes Pinhead (Doug Bradley) to appear and warns Amy that she is in danger.
Amy pursues leads, ultimately tracking down Winter LeMarchand, (Paul Rhys) the leader of the cult.
Winter is the descendant of the toymaker who designed the puzzle box, which can open a portal to a realm populated by the Cenobites, hedonistic entities that experiment in forms of extreme sadomasochism.
Winter believes that as the heir to the LeMarchand name, it is his birthright to access the realm of the Cenobites and become their master.

However, Winter has been unable to open the box himself.
Believing that it takes an individual whose life circumstances have brought them to a nihilistic point beyond life-or-death, Winter founded the Deaders, attracting emotionally vulnerable individuals, murdering them, and resurrecting them with necromancy in the hopes of creating someone who can open the box.
Winter kills and resurrects Amy, resulting in her experiencing an extended waking dream during which she relives sexual abuse from her childhood.
Coming back to reality in the Deaders' compound, Amy successfully opens the box and summons the Cenobites.
Their leader, Pinhead, expresses disdain for Winter and his family and denies that any mortal could ever control the Cenobites.
Pinhead and the Cenobites then slaughter all of the Deaders before indicating to Amy that she is now indebted to them by opening the box.
Rather than be taken back to the Cenobite realm, Amy kills herself.
