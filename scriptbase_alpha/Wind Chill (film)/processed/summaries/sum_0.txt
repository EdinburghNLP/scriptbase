A couple of college students known only as the Girl and the Guy are traveling home to Delaware the day before Christmas Eve.
They're on a frozen road that the Guy is convinced is a scenic short-cut.
In the middle of nowhere in below freezing conditions they are run off the road by a hit and runner.
They soon realize they're caught in a supernatural bubble where a crime from 1953 is doomed to repeat itself, year after year threatening new victims.
The Guy attempts to walk back to the last petrol station but his wounds from the crash are worse than he let on.
