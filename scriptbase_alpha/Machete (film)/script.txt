          EXT. MEXICAN CITY - DAY
          Aerial over the city, flying down into a FEDERALE CAR tearing
          through the slums.
                         
          Piles of garbage scatter, stray dogs scramble.
                         
                         
          INT. FEDERALE CAR, MOVING - DAY
                         
          MACHETE (MEXICAN FEDERALE OFFICER CRUZ) drives with ROOKIE
          OFFICER ERHMAN riding shotgun. A rosary swings back and forth
          on the rearview mirror.
                         
          CHIEF TORREZ's yells crackle through the police radio.
                         
                          TORREZ
                          (ON RADIO)
           Officer Cruz! Stand down! Do not
           attempt to take the safehouse
           alone! Officer Cruz! You hear me!?
                         
                          OFFICER ERHMAN
           Torrez sounds mad. You going to
           answer him?
                         
          Machete glares. Erhman nervously picks up the radio.
                         
           OFFICER ERHMAN (CONT'D)
           On route to target, no need for
           assistance.
                         
                          TORREZ
                          (ON RADIO)
           Machete, you son of a bitch! I told
           you to wait! Set up a perimeter and
           wait for further orders. You hear
           me, Pendejo!?
                         
          Machete slowly takes the radio from Erhman. He hangs up.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEXICAN HOTEL - DAY
                         
          Fleapit motel sits derelict at end of the street. Dead cars
          on the lawn, chickens scratching in the dirt.

                          OFFICER ERHMAN
           What are you doing? We're going to
           set up a perimeter right? You heard
           the boss.
                         
          Machete pulls his Machete, sticks it up to Erhman's face.
                         
                          MACHETE
           This is the boss.
                         
          Ehrman crosses himself.
                         
          A phalanx of ARMED GUARDS emerge from the dead cars. They
          narrow their weapons at MACHETE's barrelling patrolcar.
                         
                          OFFICER ERHMAN
           Hijo de puta!
                         
          Machete FLOORS it directly through the DEAD CARS and right
          through the FRONT WALL of the fleapit.

          Erhman flies THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD into the far wall. The
          car stops in front of the check-in desk.
                         
          Machete steps out. The dust clears.
                         
          More ARMED MEN stream from the office.
                         
          MACHETE sideswipes the first THUG with his MACHETE, swinging
          him around to face the fire of the others.
                         
          THUG ragdolls around like a marionette long enough for
          Machete to slash one of the men's wrists, sending his aim
          wild and taking out the others.

          Machete kicks open a door.

          Naked girl on the bed. As if she was expecting him.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Get dressed.
                         
          He checks the windows.

           It's too hot for clothes.
                         
          Checks her eyes.
                         
          She's been drugged.
                         
          He lifts her, ass over his shoulder.
                         
                          CHICA (CONT'D)
           Hey... what's your name?
                         
          She tries to read the nametag on his uniform, upside-down.
                         
                         
          INT. MEXICAN HOTEL, HALLWAY
                         
          A THUG with an UZI runs out spraying bullets.
                         
          Machete spins and impales his face into the wall. THUG's Uzi
          falls into the girl's hands.
                         
          MORE THUGS emerge from the end of the hallway.
                         
          She absently pulls the trigger, ripping into the pursuing
          men. Blood sprays the walls like Jackson Pollock.
                         
          New THUGS emerge from the front of the hallway. Machete spins
          around and the girl unloads another spray.
                         
                          CHICA
           Oh... wow.
                         
                         
          INT. MEXICAN HOTEL, LOBBY
                         
          The Uzi's out of ammo. The girl frowns and drops it.
                         
          The fucked-up patrolcar blocks the way out, for now. Machete
          resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants.
                         
          Girl arches her back, her crotch in Machete's face, then
          slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose,
          mouth.
                         
                          MACHETE
           We need to go. Now.
                         
                          CHICA
           In what? That?
                         
          The patrolcar isn't going anywhere.
                         
          She rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo.

           That looks like me.
                         
          She reaches into his pants.
                         
                          CHICA (CONT'D)
           What's this long, hard thing?
                         
                          MACHETE
           My machete.
                         
                          CHICA
           Is it sharp?
                         
          Machete looks into her eyes. She smiles drunkenly.
                         
                          CHICA (CONT'D)
           Good.
                         
          She yanks it, drawing it into his femoral artery. Hard.
                         
          He falls to the ground. He didn't see this coming.
                         
          She kicks him backwards.
                         
          He feels life escaping him. His point of view as:
                         
          She reaches down BETWEEN HER LEGS.
                         
          Fumbles with her CROTCH.
                         
          Pulls out a small cell phone from her snatch.
                         
                          CHICA (CONT'D)
                          (INTO PHONE)
           I got him.
                         
          More life escapes him. Double crossed. He's ready to give up.

           Pobrecito.
                         
          CHIEF TORREZ steps in.
                         
                          GIRL
           Como hice? (Sub: How'd I do?)
                         
                          TORREZ
           Bueno... pero no tanto. (Sub:
           Good... but not that good.)
                         
          He shoots her once; she drops, then he empties the gun into
          her body, making her do a spider dance on the floor.

           You had to stick your neck where it
           didn't belong, amigo.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Torrez?
                         
          Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes
          backwards onto the floor.
                         
          A SECOND MAN enters. This is DRUGLORD.
                         
                          DRUGLORD
           No, not Torrez. El Santo Muerte,
           pendejo. (I'm Saint Death,
           pendejo.)
                         
          DRUGLORD draws a Samurai sword and SLICES Machete like
          carving meat. We don't see it.

           it. Burn it all.)
                         
          Druglord walks out. Through Machete's blurred vision we see
          Torrez and other officers lighting rags dipped in bottles of
          tequila and throwing them into the corners of the room.
                         
          The place goes up as they run out.
                         
          Machete crawls and collapses as the flames rise around him
                         AND WE
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.

          A group of ILLEGALS hunker down in the brush, creeping in the
          moonlight.
                         
          One of them coughs and seizes, obviously sick. Another points
          at a WATER STATION up ahead, pulling the sick man along.
                         
          Headlights of a large TRUCK appear over a ridge. A spotlight
          scans the brush, catches them. ARMED MEN ride in the bed of
          the truck.

          The burly driver, VON, shifts into gear and barrels down.
          They scatter.
                         
          Shots from the truck hit them.
                         
          One keeps running.
                         
          They corner the last illegal. He's lit in the spotlight like
          Christ on the cross, arms wide in surrender. VON smiles.

          ELEKTRA RIVERS, 20s, lies naked, soaking in a bubble bath.
          She stretches, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her bod.
                         
          She's having her "private time," caressing every inch of her
          body with a phallic loofah. She oohs and ahhs with the joys
          of pleasuring herself in the tub.
                         
          Headlights appear through the venetian blinds. She stops.
                         
          Sounds of people getting out of a car, laughing, shushing
          each other. Then a key in a lock, struggling to open it. A
          door forcibly opens.
                         
          More sounds of fumbling and shushing.

          Lights come on. ELEKTRA stands in a bathrobe.
                         
          COUPLE are stunned. Especially since the naked woman in bed
          looks just like ELEKTRA.

          Men circle in an alleyway, laying money down on the ground,
          placing bets on the two fighters in the makeshift ring.
                         
          One is a brawny thug with a neck like a tree trunk. The other
          is strong, but not big.
                         
          Brawny Thug makes quick work of his opponent. The men cheer.
                         
          Brawny Thug's HANDLER coaxes the crowd for another opponent.

          Machete stops.
                         
          Rico, a WORKER, lays a fistful of bills on the ground.

          A Benz pulls up into the alley, and a bearded man wearing
          sunglasses steps out, still in the shadows, watching from a
          distance.
                         
          Machete and the brawny thug fist fight bareknuckled. Brawny
          gets in several good punches, knocking Machete about, but
          Machete comes from behind to lay him out.
                         
          Brawny falls on his face with a sickening crunch.

          Machete walks around him. Bruno blocks his path and
                         
          sticks a Glock in Machete's face.

          Luz drops her apron and gives them an eyeful. Her tan body is
          barely covered in cut offs and a blouse. She makes Daisy Duke
          look like Jabba the Hutt.
                         
          A CLEAVER is in her manicured hand. She waves him over.

           What our senator fails to realize
           is that this country runs on
           illegal labor. Thrives on it. Keeps
           costs down, keeps the wheels
           moving. Bust that, and the world

          Machete walks past the automatics and blades. He stops at a
          machete.
                         
                          BENZ
           You like the machete, huh? Strictly
           low-tech, but good close-up, or if
           you're trying to make a
           particularly brutal point. But it's
           entirely unsuited to our purposes.
           Here. Have a look at this.

          Machete wheels a mop and bucket. He pulls a plastic bag out
          of the gray water and enters the stairwell.

          Machete slips the pieces of the rifle out of the plastic bag

          Throngs of people are gathered to hear the Senator's speech.
          The citizen militia led by Von carry signs of support for
          McLaughlin and other anti-immigration slogans. They wear caps
          marked "FREEDOM FORCE."
                         
          Across the street, a counterprotest group assembles with
          signs of their own. Luz's TACO TRUCK is there.

          McLaughlin stands at the podium. Behind him hangs a banner:

           Make no mistake, my friends: We are
           at WAR. Every time an illegal
           sneaks across the border by dark of
           night it is an act of aggression
           against the United States. And I
           submit to you, it is an overt act
           of TERRORISM. These people are
           TERRORISTS.
                         
          Cheers swell in the crowd, spiked with boos and jeers from
          across the street.

          Machete readies the sniper rifle and aims down at his target.
                         
          Something catches his eye-a glint of a reflection-as he spots-

          ANOTHER SNIPER across the way, aiming another SNIPER RIFLE
          directly at HIM.
                         
          MACHETE lets off two quick rounds and the SNIPER lets off
          three shots in rapid succession and one of them catches
          Machete in the shoulder. He flips onto his back and out of
          the other sniper's line of sight.

          Down below, Machete's bullet has grazed McLaughlin's cheek.
          The second bullet has shattered McLaughlin's shin. The throng
          scrambles for cover as armed guards draw their weapons and
          scan the skies.

          Machete zips up the gray coveralls but the blood starts to
          seep through. He pushes the mop and bucket and a small
          trickle of blood runs down the mop handle from where it leans
          against Machete's shoulder and into the bucket.
                         
          He walks briskly to the elevator and slips inside.

          The elevator stops on the sixth floor. A GUARD enters,
          talking on a 2-way.

           Roger. I'm on my way.
                         
          Machete pushes the bucket and mop out. The guard notices
          blood on the floor.
                         
                          GUARD (CONT'D)
           Hey!
                         
          He reaches for Machete but Machete pulls a hidden blade from
          the mop handle and jacks the guy with quick, sharp thrusts
          into his neck. The guard slides backwards into the elevator
          as the door closes.

          sideways and sliding across the pavement.
                         
          Machete slides out through the busted glass and frees his

                          MACHETE
           Bless me, Padre, for I have sinned.
           It's been a long fucking time since
           my last confession.
                         
                          PADRE
           I was wondering when you were going
           to show yourself. They're combing
           the city for you. How long before
           they get your file and track down
           your stepbrother, the priest?
                         
                          MACHETE
           Sorry, bro. I mean, Padre.
                         
                          PADRE
           You were wrong to come here. How
           long have you been here anyway?

                          PADRE
           Why didn't you come to me before?
                         
                          MACHETE
           Didn't need you before.
                         
                          PADRE
           What do you think I can do for you?
           Give you absolution? You have to be
           sorry for your sins, first.
                         
                          MACHETE
           I'm not sorry.
                         
                          PADRE
           I'm not surprised.
                         
                          MACHETE
           They used me.
                         
                          PADRE
           They use all of us. Welcome to the
           real world.

                          MACHETE
           Either. Both.
                         
                          PADRE
           I am a man of faith. I took a vow
           of peace. You want me to help you
           kill all these men?
                         
                          MACHETE
           Yes, bro. I mean, Padre.
                         
                          PADRE
           I'll see what I can do.
                         
          Padre shakes his head, makes the sign of the cross.

          Luz's taco truck in its usual spot. Luz is sitting at the
          window playing with LOTERIA CARDS.
                         
          Sniper pulls up. Shows Machete's picture to men who try to
          avoid him. He braces a few of them.
                         
                          LUZ
           Hey Culero, leave them alone. They
           don't like pork.
                         
          He shows her the sketch of Machete.
                         
                          SNIPER
           I'm no cop. You seen this guy?
                         
          Luz flips over a LOTERIA CARD with the grim reaper. She shows
          it to Sniper.
                         
                          LUZ
           Have you seen him?
                         
          Sniper slaps it out of her hand.

           Cono,this won't end pretty.
                         
          He grabs her arm, pins it to the counter and jabs a
          switchblade into it, carving out a phone number.

           that pretty face of yours into a
           seven layer burrito got that puta!?

          Machete follows Padre into the church sacristy, a plush
          bachelor pad.
                         
                          MACHETE
           When I get the money, I'll give
           some to the church.
                         
                          PADRE
           You think Jesus wants your blood
           money, Judas?
                         
          Machete shrugs. Padre lights a cigar and pours them two
          drinks.
                         
                          PADRE (CONT'D)
           How much blood money are we talking
           about?

          Machete eyes a bank of security monitors. Different
          surveillance shots of the interior and exterior of the
          church.

           I had them installed last year. Too
           many things were walking away from

           Check this out.
                         
          Padre points at a kneeler in front of a rustic altar-looking
          armoire. Machete kneels.
                         
          Padre opens the armoire revealing an HD TV inside.

           see this. I Tivo'd it earlier.
                         
          News footage of the sniper attack plays. Machete sees himself
          on the big screen.

          Padre pauses.
                         
          Machete picks out BENZ helping MCLAUGHLIN into the LIMO.

          She reaches for the ten and Machete grabs her wrist, sees the
          sniper switchblade scar. She pulls away, slips the money
          between her breasts.

           Sure thing, Boss.
                         
          The truck REAR ENDS them, sending Elektra's car over the
          curb. They rattle around inside like ragdolls.

          She ducks back in, peels out. The truck revs up and pursues.
                         
          A second TRUCK joins the chase.
                         
          They sandwich Elektra's car between them.
                         
          Machete chops off the driver's hand of the right-side truck

          She takes a swig, pops a pill and stares at the bloody hole.
                         
          She holds her arm up ready...

          She JAMS the baster in. The fluid squirts in the hole and
          SIZZLES.
                         
          Elektra watches in awe as dark green fluid dribbles out of
          the wound, followed by a thick yellow goo with veins and
          lumps of flesh.
                         
          It bubbles like a volcano, she peers in and suddenly...
                         
          It BURSTS and SPRAYS pus and flesh chunks all over her.

          Luz is bleeding, one eye gouged out, fading fast.

          Sniper sniffs the air, smells the gas.

           Fuck that, you wait.
                         
          The overeager henchman opens fire. The bullets slam into the
          truck ignite the gas and it EXPLODES.
                         
          They are blasted back by the fireball.
                         
          Sniper and the Henchman wake up amidst the burning wreckage.

          Mount a siege of the church.
                         
          Gunfight with Padre. Exploding candles as bullets rip through
          the church. Elderly Hispanic women in shawls scatter and run
          for the doors.
                         
          Gun battle continues outside.
                         
          Padre goes to car trunk, pops it, withdraws two big shotguns.
                         
          Henchmen in a car try to run him down. He blows the car into
          the air with double-blasts.
                         
          Padre faces down a HENCHMAN.

          It's the room where June and April were.

          Sniper hammers a nail into Padre's hand. Padre grits his
          teeth against the pain.

          Sniper raises the hammer again, but Booth stills his hand,
          takes the hammer.

                          ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
           So what happens now, when you get
           him, that's it? It's over?
                         
          Elektra hears a noise in the back of the house.
                         
                          ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
           Did you hear that? Stay here.
                         
          Elektra runs into the back.
                         
          Machete hears a scream from the bedroom. He heads towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Machete enters. The lights are low.
                         
          Elektra grabs him from behind, gropes him.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           Oh wow...is that a machete in your
           pocket or...
                         
                          MACHETE
           You're borracha.

          She pushes him down on the bed and stands over him. She's in
          lingerie.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           I'm gonna fuck your brains out old
           man!
                         
          She pushes him back onto the bed.
                         
          She tears her clothes off, jumps on him and fucks his brains
          out.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT
                         
          Guns are loaded. Shotguns racked.
                         
          Men with guns run up the stairs.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Elektra's on top; manic, yelling, scratching. The bed frame
                         CRACKS
                         
          Machete sees a SHADOW of a man through the window curtain and
          another...
                         
          He tries to push her off him.
                         
          She WON'T let him! She's an animal, screeches and yells in
          SPANISH.
                         
          Machete grabs the gun off the night table, just as the HIT
          SQUAD gets there.
                         
          He manages to keep Elektra happy as he BLASTS the MASKED
          HITMEN coming in.
                         
          They crash through the windows and doors as he finishes
          everyone off at once.
                         
          Elektra lets out a final scream and collapses on him.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           Wow that was...
                         
          She notices the carnage.
                         
                          ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
           Oh my god...did I wake the
           neighbors?
                         
          They get up. She pulls the ski mask off a dead gunman.

                          ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
           This is one of ours. He works for
           the agency.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Come on!
                         
          They grab guns and run out.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT
                         
          Machete and Elektra run outside.
                         
          Sniper and his men are waiting for them; guns drawn.
                         
          He waves for his men to lower their guns.
                         
                          SNIPER
           Machete you can come quietly and we
           won't hurt the girl.
                         
          Machete contemplates this.
                         
                          SNIPER (CONT'D)
           You can trust me. I've brought one
           of your old friends to vouch for
           me.
                         
          Erhman waves with his BANDAGED hand.
                         
                          ERHMAN
           Hola Machete amigo, long time!
                         
          Erhman beams a big cheese eating smile.
                         
          Machete draws his gun.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Not long enough.
                         
          Erhman's smile fades. Machete SHOOTS him in the face.
                         
          Machete and Elektra open fire with machine guns and speed off
          in a Volkswagon bug.

          Elektra enters. She's slowly surrounded by rough-looking
          Mexicans.

           My friend and I need a little help.
                         
          They see Machete behind her.
                         
                          MAN
           It's him.
                         
                         
          MONTAGE: CHOP SHOP ROCK
                         
          Machete sharpens blades, makes all kinds of razor-sharp metal
          weaponry in the chop shop, using all kinds of scrap metal.
                         
          Machete lays down sketches and blueprints. The men and
          Machete build out a tricked-out arsenal on tricked-out
          vehicles, like something out of a south of the border Road
          Warrior.
                         
          Machete sharpens his blade as sparks fly.
                         
                         
          EXT. ALLEY, CHOP SHOP
                         
          Sniper cruises by, hunting for Machete.
                         
          The chop shop boys spot Sniper snooping. They bring out a
          huge blowtorch and carve up his hood.
                         
                          SNIPER
           You punk kids! That's it!
                         
          Sniper climbs out of his car, gun in hand.
                         
          A steak KNIFE flies in from off screen and skewers his wrist.
                         
          He stumbles back gushing blood,and sees...
                         
          Luz; alive and well, a red eye patch on. She's wrapped in
          white bandages crossing and covering her chest and her arm.
                         
          She's a mess but a beautiful one, like a female road warrior.
                         
          Band aids on her forehead. The white bandages cover her dark
          skin.
                         
                          LUZ
           Cabron, I told you it wouldn't end
           pretty.
           (to the guys)
           Bring him inside.
                         
          They drag Sniper out of the car and into the chop shop.

          Back to the moment Luz has passed out in the truck.
                         
          Pancho barks; BITES Luz on the ASS and pulls her out of the
          Taco Truck seconds before it explodes.

          Sniper struggles as they drag him toward a circular saw.
                         
                          SNIPER
           No! No!

           Oh my God... Please... No. Please!
           NO!!!
                         
          They bring Sniper up to the saw and grind away at him.
                         
          Luz and Pancho look on.

          Booth walks towards McLaughlin's room, cellphone in hand,
          trying to reach Sniper. Only gets a gurgling, buzzing sound.

          Booth enters McLaughlin's hospital room. McLaughlin is
          dressed in a suit and a girl is brushing his hair while
          another brightens his cheeks with a little makeup.

           My business is here. Did you see
           those crews out there? They expect
           a statement.
           (noticing Booth's ragged
                          APPEARANCE)
           Jesus, what happened to you?
                         
                          BENZ
           Nothing. Just had a little talk
           with a priest.
                         
                          MCLAUGHLIN
           Well, what am I going to tell `em?
                         
                          BENZ
           Whatever you tell them, I'm sure
           it'll be golden.
           (off McLaughlin's blank
                          LOOK)
           Just feed them the line about
           standing steadfast in the face of
           terrorism, continuing the fight.
           You know it by heart.
                         
          McLaughlin looks relieved.
                         
                          MCLAUGHLIN
           I do. All right. Once this is done,
           you need to take a vacation. You
           need some air.
                         
                          BENZ
           Maybe.
                         
                          MCLAUGHLIN
           No doubt about it. You're losing
           your marbles, Booth.
                         
          The girl finishes the makeup and hair job, and smiles at
          McLaughlin.

           It's showtime.
                         
          McLaughlin stands and exits, Booth right behind them. As they
          leave, we focus on the TV set in McLaughlin's room, showing
          the front of the hospital and the news crews outside.
          Suddenly the ticker shows BREAKING NEWS... SHOOTOUT AT LOCAL

          Torrez watches from a distance, looking around.
                         
          Torrez sees Elektra's car drive by. He hops into his rental
          and follows her.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          McLaughlin and Booth exit the hospital to face the throng of
          reporters. McLaughlin approaches a makeshift lectern of
          microphones.
                         
                          MCLAUGHLIN
           I'd just like to thank the all of
           you for your support during this
           difficult time.
                         
          McLaughlin's supporters cheer and hold up pro-McLaughlin,
          anti-immigration signs.
                         
                          MCLAUGHLIN (CONT'D)
           My will to fight has only just

           Congressman, there are reports
           implicating your advisors as having
           orchestrated the shooting. Would
           you care to comment?
                         
          The cheers fizzle. McLaughlin looks stunned.

          They stop.
                         
          Suddenly, MACHETE is standing on top of the limo. He's
          throwing knives into the open sunroof.
                         
          McLaughlin is pinned to the seat.

          Booth cuts one of the men and the pitbulls go after him.
                         
          Booth escapes from the circle and carjacks a woman.
                         
          He kicks her out of the car and speeds towards the Armory.

          wounded Mexican. Doc flicks a SCALPEL at an approaching Goon.
                         
          Machete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that
          affixes to the front of the chopper.
                         
          Booth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered. He tries
          to take cover behind thugs, but--
                         
          Machete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down
          Booth, machine gunning him in half.
                         
          Booth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson
          and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in TWO PIECES.
                         
          While the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on--
                         
          TORREZ appears with ELEKTRA--
                         
                          TORREZ
           Machete!
                         
          Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in
          Torrez's control.
                         
                          TORREZ (CONT'D)
           You never learned to stay down,
           pendejo. I killed you once. I can
           do it again.
                         
                         
          INT. WAREHOUSE
                         
          Machete skids into the warehouse. Fuel barrels line a far
          wall.
                         
          Torrez is ready for him.
                         
                          TORREZ
           All roads lead to Hell, eh,
           Machete?
                         
          Machete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two
          images blur into one.
                         
                          TORREZ (CONT'D)
           Most people die in the fire, but
           you survived, you unlucky bastard.
                         
                          MACHETE
           I was born in the fire. It wasn't
           luck.
           RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83.
                         
                         
                          TORREZ
           Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good
           job picking melons. While I bought
           the world.
                         
                          MACHETE
           What good is it...
                         
           TORREZ.
           .. for a man to gain the whole
           world yet forfeit his soul? Mark
           8:36. I know it better than you
           Machete. Your father taught it to
           me, too!
                         
          Torrez ATTACKS Machete
                         
          The two FIGHT with sword and machete.
                         
          Elektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows
          from the samurai swords.
                         
          One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety.
                         
          The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand
          and slash Torrez across the front.
                         
          On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften.
                         
                          TORREZ
                          (IN SPANISH)
           Machete, we were friends. We stood
           for something...
                         
          Machete impales TORREZ between the eyes.
                         
          Blood shoots out his mouth.
                         
                          MACHETE
           I'm still standing...Puta.
                         
          Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead.
                         
          EXPLOSIONS and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          FADE IN.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Machete drives his Gun Bike south.
           RNewman / Endeavor Draft 84.
                         
                         
          COP LIGHTS appear behind him.
                         
          He pulls over.
                         
          The Officer walks up. His flashlight blinds him.
                         
                          MACHETE
           What's the problem officer?
                         
          The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight
          blinding in Machete's eyes.
                         
                          MACHETE (CONT'D)
           Let me give you my ID.
                         
          Machete reaches for his knife: then he sees the cops shoes;
                         
          RED STILETTOS; It's ELEKTRA.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           What's your name?
                         
                          MACHETE
           Machete.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           I called in some favors. Look at
           this. All the right papers; a real
           identity. You could start over, be
           a real person.
                         
          She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it,
          then crumbles it and drops it.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Why do I want to be a real
           person... when I'm already a myth?
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           Where will you go?
                         
                          MACHETE
           Torrez was just an errand boy. I'm
           going to find the man who sent the
           message.
                         
          Elektra steps into the headlights. She's dressed in hot COP
          LINGERIE.
                         
                          ELEKTRA
           I'll ride with you.

          They kiss.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK

          Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike.
                         
          The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still
          flashing.
                         
                         FADE OUT

          DESERT - NIGHT.
                         
          A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a
          WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and
          drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one
          of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's
          someone out there, shooting at them.
                         
          MOTHER hushes the younger ones.
                         
                          MOTHER
           Say a prayer to El Machete to
           protect you.
                         
          The younger ones start to pray.
                         
          A JEEP patrols the area and we see it's MINUTEMEN taking
          potshots at the illegals.
                         
                          MILITIA MAN
           Did you get `em?
                         
                          2ND MINUTEMAN
           I don't know. They're like brown
           jackrabbits. Let's see if they'll
           show their little white tails.
                         
          Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the
          JEEP.
                         
          The light is on long enough to illuminate a MACHETE BLADE
          coming straight for them.
                         
                          MILITIA MAN
           Holy shit!
                         
          His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from
          his body. 2nd MINUTEMAN freaks and makes a run for it.
           RNewman / Endeavor Draft 86.
                         
                         
          Stumbles in the dark, in the dust. Scrambles but can't get to
          his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him.
                         
          Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on
          2nd MINUTEMAN.
                         
          Sounds of struggle, slaughter... then silence.
                         
                          MACHETE
           Light a candle... Say a prayer...
                         
          Young illegal opens eyes...
                         
          There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around.
          Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette
          of MACHETE...
